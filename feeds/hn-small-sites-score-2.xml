<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>P</span>eople afflicted by Covid-19, particularly those with bad cases, experience difficulty breathing.&nbsp; We need oxygen in our tissues to keep our bodies working and our brains clear; viral damage to our lungs deprives bodies of this vital dissolved gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>	This oxygen-starved condition is called hypoxia, and itâ€™s also a serious condition in many parts of the worldâ€™s ocean, as well as in estuaries, lagoons, rivers, and lakes. Marine hypoxia receives much less public attention than ocean acidification or warming—but in many parts of the world its effects may be just as profound, and the problem is worsening.</p>
<p>	The causes of marine hypoxia are twofold. The first, which has been studied the most, is the too-much-of-a-good-thing problem of nutrient over-enrichment. Vast loads of nutrients are applied to farm fields as fertilizers, spill from our sewage and septic systems, and waft from the tailpipes of automobiles. Inevitably some of these make their way into water, stimulating blooms of tiny plankton that eventually die and decay.&nbsp;The process of decaying consumes the oxygen, and hypoxia ensues. Wastewater treatment plants have helped but are not enough. Some nutrient-loaded hypoxic waters are now-infamous â€œdead zones,â€� such as the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie most summers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The other major cause is global warming.&nbsp;Warmer water canâ€™t hold as much dissolved oxygen as colder water. Itâ€™s lighter, too, and therefore tends to float above cooler layers, cutting them off from atmospheric exchange so that they eventually become deoxygenated as well. This phenomenon isnâ€™t directly associated with nutrient over-enrichment, but can exacerbate and intensify dead zones and impact deep ocean waters that have few nutrients. Warming is a global problem affecting the oxygen status of all waters—and it also fuels blooms of algae that die and decay, again setting off the cycle of oxygen loss.</p>
<p>	The general public—and even many scientists—are unaware of the rapidly expanding scale of deoxygenation. Among the first researchers to describe it were marine ecologists Bob Diaz and Rutger Rosenberg, who in the 1980s began to study the impacts on bottom-dwelling organisms in estuaries and coastal seas. In 1995 they wrote, "There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen." &nbsp;</p>
<p>	In 2008, Diaz and Rosenberg published a landmark study in the journal <em>Science</em>, documenting over 400 such zones and showing that their growth was exponential.&nbsp;By 2019 their tally exceeded 700, and possibly as many as 1000, coastal dead zones.&nbsp;If we make a chart of the known history of increase and color-code it by Gross World Product, an index of global economic output, we can appreciate the linkage of these dead zones to human activity:</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_423219c2026b77bfba722aa122b966a6.jpg" alt="dead zones and GWP chart"><figcaption><span>Growth in the number of coastal marine ecosystems classified as â€œdead zonesâ€� by Diaz and Rosenberg (2008) and Diaz et al. (2019).  The colors indicate levels of Gross World Product (GWP), and show that as economic output has increased exponentially, so has the number of polluted, deoxygenated dead zones. </span><br><span>GWP data: World Bank and CIA Factbook (compiled in Wikipedia).</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation in open oceans, away from coasts, extends farther and deeper, and is largely caused by the aforementioned tendency of warm water to seal off the cool waters below. The extent and spread of these so-called oxygen minimum zones wasnâ€™t fully appreciated until around 15 years ago, when improved instrumentation allowed scientists to measure them.&nbsp;Ten years ago their total area was estimated at 8 percent of Earth's ocean surface area—11.7 million square miles altogether, an area larger than North America and comparable in size to the entire African continent. That area is expanding today.<br></p>
<p>Brief periods of hypoxia—or even no oxygen, a phenomenon called anoxia—are common in nature and many organisms adapt by moving away or going temporarily dormant.&nbsp;A very few species are exceptionally tolerant and even have specialized metabolic pathways to cope in these circumstances.&nbsp;As the scale of deoxygenation increases, however, we see low-oxygen events so large and long that even highly mobile organisms, like fish, canâ€™t always escape.&nbsp;Some may be able to survive but become so weak that they have difficulty moving and finding food, let alone digesting it.&nbsp;Think of the Covid-19 sufferers who are so exhausted from lack of oxygen that they can barely move.&nbsp;Itâ€™s the same basic issue.&nbsp;As scientists study the problem of marine deoxygenation, we are increasingly seeing the effects on everything from fish growth to reproductive impairment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most of the studies on biotic effects of deoxygenation have taken place in laboratories, my colleague Ben Walther and I, together with our students and colleagues, have learned to decipher signs of hypoxia exposure that are â€œrecordedâ€� in tiny bones within fish heads, called otoliths or ear-stones.&nbsp;These calcium carbonate deposits grow incrementally and take up various trace elements including the element manganese, which becomes available only at very low oxygen concentrations.&nbsp;By studying the lifetime uptake of manganese, biologist Michele Casini and I showed that periods of intense hypoxia have profound impacts on the growth and health of Atlantic cod in the Baltic Sea. With less oxygen available, cod have less energy for foraging and fighting off parasites and infections. As a result, they are unhealthy and shrunken compared to cod living in better environments. By age three, cod with high levels of hypoxia exposure are one-third smaller than healthy cod from oxygen-rich waters. Multiply that by population size and you have an epic loss of biomass. This has direct economic consequences and likely causes enormous suffering for the fish themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_15b7f377d5e469878f05995df3610167.jpg" alt="Cod before-and-after"><figcaption><span>Left: Cod caught in 1981 off the island of Gotland, Sweden. Right: Cod caught in 2020 in the same vicinity. Baltic cod today are affected by several stressors, foremost among them hypoxia. </span><br><span>K. Limburg and Y. Heimbrand</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Deoxygenation impacts ripple through entire ecosystems, too.&nbsp;Recent work has shown that in large stretches of the ocean even zooplankton, the microscopic animals who feed fish, often live on the edge of metabolic collapse. A study in the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone found that zooplankton there migrate in and out of microhabitats with extremely low oxygen; they are among the most hypoxia-tolerant organisms, yet are already at their metabolic limits. Projected further declines in oxygen may put them over the edge, with important consequences for carbon cycling and other biogeochemical processes in the open ocean.&nbsp;Food webs become compromised, particularly those on sea bottoms; there are many documented cases of sensitive invertebrate communities falling victim to hypoxic events since they cannot flee. Hypoxia has even been found to cause mass mortality in coral reef ecosystems, and in some instances may play as important a role as the better-known culprit of elevated water temperatures. Even open-water ecosystems change as the volume of healthy habitat shrinks and species crowd together, leading to novel food-web interactions. Covid-19â€™s web of long-term complications presents an uncanny parallel.<br></p>
<p>	Fortunately for humanity, a vaccine for Covid-19 should be available in 2021.&nbsp;The outlook for the oceans is not so optimistic, but neither is it hopeless.&nbsp;Think about the initial response to the virus, which was hamstrung by shortages of necessary medical supplies and technology, including masks and respirators; once the issues were recognized, it became possible to prioritize production to deal with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of coastal hypoxia, nutrient pollution reductions coupled with wetland and seagrass restoration are akin to masks and respirators. They help protect the ecosystems and build up their resiliency. Those approaches resulted in greatly improved water quality and subsequent return of biodiversity in the waters off Tampa Bay, Florida, for example. And after decades of nutrient management, some parts of the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay are beginning to show signs of recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The looming, elephant-in-the-room challenge is to deal with global warming, which will require new economic policies at national and global scales and the commitment of governments and citizens everywhere. Although overshadowed in the news cycle by Covid-19, global warming is still on the rise, fueled by human outputs of greenhouse gases.&nbsp;We <em>must</em> bend the curve on greenhouse gas emissions, just as we must flatten the Covid-19 curve. Without such change, we are headed in a dark, scary direction where nobody really wants to go.</p>

  <p>I had been a happy-go Java developer on Windows platform. And then I had to ride the Ruby-on-Rails wave over Linux platform, only to realize how much I didn't know about productivity with automation. Later I moved onto MacOS to experience bliss before starting to hate it for one thing after the other; right from their buggy operating system upgrades to Apple not providing power cable compatible to Indian market resulting in earthing issues. Out of frustration I jumped back to Ubuntu and now back on Windows after long years.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting onto Windows was more out of necessity than interest and I started to explore how much things have changed in the Windows world. It wasn't a smooth return for me but the teething period is over and I'm loving Windows again. If you are onto Windows 10 Pro edition, and wanting to get the best of both worlds (Windows and Linux), this post is for you. I am jotting down ProTips to experience delight and productivity at development work.</p>
<ol><li>Use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1, for the former is far less resource intensive by integrating natively with Windows 10 Hyper-V virtualization stack, and thus phenomenally faster too. If you are on Windows 10 Home edition, you need to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro edition and it is worth it, for you can get it at half the price upon upgrade.</li><li>Do not mount windows native formatted drive (NTFS) onto WSL for code that can be developed both in WSL environment and Windows. While this works, it is snail paced and you will frustrated too soon. I tried this out of curiosity and frustrated beyond my anticipation. If you are still wanting this, you will have to first format the storage drive in DOS format (as FAT32), so that it works well with your WSL and host Windows operating systems. This is possible the best middle-ground that you can hit upon.</li><li>Use <a href="https://aka.ms/terminal" target="_blank">Windows Terminal</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp; <a href="https://blog.codonomics.com/2020/09/Cmder" target="_blank">Cmder</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu" target="_blank">ConEmu</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mintty/mintty" target="_blank">Mintty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> or any other console emulators. Why? You can customize it with default settings for each of WSLs, Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or other terminals integrated with it. Also Windows Terminal is lightweight and faster.</li><li>When you start your development server in WSL 2, try testing it in your browser with <b><i>localhost</i></b>, it won't work. WSL is one proper sandboxed environment or VM. You need to port forward localhost settings for this to work. This can be done by adding the line like below in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file in your windows <b><i>$HOME</i></b> directory.<br>--
 --<br>
 </li><li>WSL 2 can consume all of your host memory. You can set limits to it by appending the line&nbsp;<b><i>memory=16GB</i></b> in your <b><i>.wslconfig</i></b> file.</li><li>Do install <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" target="_blank">Oh-My-ZSH</a> to use zsh shell instead of the default bash. You get bunch of goodies like pre-configured aliases for Git and more by way of its plugins that you can configure to your preference.</li><li>If you are into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" target="_blank">tmux</a>, you can use that too in your WSL 2, and power it up with <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline" target="_blank">tmux-powerline</a>.</li><li>You can change the location of your WSL 2 distribution's virtual hard drive.&nbsp;I keep all of my VMs (and now WSL 2 virtual hard drives) in <b><i>D:\VMs\&lt;platform&gt;\&lt;distribution name&gt;</i></b>. Run the following commands in PowerShell - replacing distribution name and preferred location: <br>----<br> Also at the time of writing, when you import a distribution, you may need to tell WSL 2 to start the distribution using the Linux user account you created when you first created the distribution. Thanks to <a href="https://www.58bits.com/blog/2020/05/30/wsl-2-setup-development">58bits.com </a> that you can run the below PowerShell script that imports the distribution, and resets the default user as you would like it to be. <br>-- --<br> Note that if your import fails with 'Unspecified error' (or other) - you may need to limit the amount of memory allocated to <b><i>vmmem</i></b>. You can do this with WSL2 config to limit memory as mentioned in ProTip 5 above.</li><li>If you are into using VS-Code as your IDE for development, you can launch the one you installed on your host Windows 10 OS from WSL 2 bash in your project's root folder and executing <b><i>`code .`</i></b>. With this you can work on your windows operating system launching your development servers in WSL environment, thus getting the best of both the worlds. Additionally, you can install your vs-code extensions on remote wsl as well as on host OS, all from within your IDE.</li><li>And <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" target="_blank">Docker Desktop for Windows</a> works well with your WSL2 too. You just can extract the best from everything.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Windows 10 is super cool again with WSL 2. Whether you are a Windows buff wanting to leverage Linux goodies, or a Linux buff wanting to draw upon Windows 10 strengths, you can have it all. Happy coding!!..

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Daniel J. Bernstein's IM2000 email proposal is not a good idea</h2>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the pandemic hit global news, everyone (I presume) and especially on Twitter were sharing their predictions about the future.<br></p><p>Apart from the range of predictions from dark and gloomy to “it’s going to be alright soon” optimism, there was intense collective thought being shared on how to adjust to the new life.&nbsp;</p><p>A dangerous outside world with a potentially lethal virus, getting stuck indoors and hence being wrenched out of every routine and social habits, general anxiety and fear for yourself and your loved ones - didn’t stop people from sharing “if you don’t build your business ideas while you’re stuck indoors, you’ll never do it”. Or “this is the best time to become fit and the best version of yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>You know, non-empathetic BS that treats human beings like a robot following a set of instructions.</p><p>I spent month 1 in anxiety and fear desperately trying to adjust to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>By month 2, I’d figured out that to not go insane, I will have to block news, browsing Twitter, and any websites tracking the pandemic 12 times a day. And so I did. My mind felt wrinkled until I let go, and it felt like I could relax and breathe &nbsp;again.</p><p>In the same month, I thought I would adjust and “become the best version of myself” or whatever hustle porn phrase was trending that week. I failed at adjusting and living a “normal” life for several months. I stopped trying so hard.</p><p>It also dawned on me that while my problems are real, the people really facing a hard time are those from the lower economic strata. They don't just have an option to live indoors and "WFH". They can't quit their jobs and go home. I became grateful about my position and privilege in life and internally I stopped complaining to myself about how difficult life is during a pandemic. I became calm.</p><p>It’s month 7 and I think I finally got a grip on my life.</p><p>You see, building new routines and adjusting to new social normals is a long process. Sure, you can write it down on a piece of paper and try to follow it, but your body and mind aren’t fully aligned and adjusted.</p><p>In particular, I found being stuck within 4 walls and not talking to anyone other than my family members for months wasn't going to help me adjust to the new normal.</p><p>In June, I started writing. This was the first step towards normalcy as I finally got in touch with my thoughts again and found an outlet to express them.</p><p>And only in the last month, I created a routine around going downstairs for a long 45-min brisk walk (while wearing a mask and avoiding people like the plague). I also started scheduling a lot of calls whenever someone from my life reached out, just to catch up with them and behave like we would had we bumped into each other at a coffee shop.</p><p>Human beings are incredible at adapting to a situation and normalising it. Life is finally starting to feel normal again. It just takes time, in this case 7 &nbsp;months.</p><p>I can see this in other people too - their behaviours, their mood, what they are saying when you talk to them and what you see people talk about on Twitter and other social platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, I played <a href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=puertorico" target="_blank">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">Akash</a> in the afternoon. In the evening. I walked while listening and occasionally babbling with a group of people on <a href="https://leher.app/" target="_blank">Leher</a> (Clubhouse for India). It felt like a fun conversation we would have otherwise had over a beer had we met physically. At night, I joked and laughed around with college friends over a Zoom call. </p><p>Life felt normal.</p><p>While the pandemic is bigger than ever and it’s imperative that we continue following all safety guidelines, having a routine you follow everyday, going outdoors regularly, socialising with people on video or phone calls - helps me adjust to this life in a pandemic.</p></div></div>]]>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

    <h3>PDP 11/70 Emulator - v3.1 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
      This emulator came about because years ago I was a programmer for RSTS/E on a PDP 11/45 and had admired the console idle loop light pattern - but I couldn't quite remember how it looked. Given the unavailability of real systems it became time to write
      an emulator!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going to start with a PDP 11/45 emulator but the extra memory of a PDP 11/70 became far too attractive (a whole 4MB!). It took some time before I finally produced a
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11-45.html">PDP 11/45</a> version.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met my core objective - I can now see the RSTS/E console light pattern that I was looking for, and found that newer versions (eg v9.6) have a different light pattern. Also I have now seen some of the light patterns for other OSes. RSX and BSD 2.11
      have their own different patterns and Unix V5 and Ultrix operate with absolute minimum light movement (I'm assuming they operates mostly in WAIT mode).
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting all of the operating systems used here presents its own set of challenges - one of which is finding the software in the first place. But one of the most interesting was RSTS/E V06C which has its own
      <a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/RSTSv06c.html">story</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The boot code in this emulator is a custom PDP 11 program running with it's own set of light patterns. It is initially loaded at address 140000 and has a LIGHTS command which operates by mapping and executing a WAIT instruction from a pattern of virtual addresses located in Supervisor
      mode. You can also use the BOOT command to start one of the guest operating systems listed below, or the ODT command to start a version of the Octal Debugging Tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      However boot code like this was not part of early PDP 11s. These systems had no BIOS or other software to help get the bare metal started. If you were lucky perhaps the previous boot code would still be intact in non-volatile magnetic core memory, but in general booting the system required toggling in a small bootstrap loader from the front panel. There are listings of bootstrap loaders for various devices
      <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/pdp-11/bootstraps.html">here</a>.
      If you are a purist don't use the boot code! Instead find the bootstrap code for the device you want to boot from and toggle it in through the switches. However be warned - the boot program will not work unless toggled in perfectly which often takes a few goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the switch commands for booting from an RK05 where the value at address 1002 selects the unit number (rk0, rk1, rk2, etc). Goodluck!
    </p>
    <pre><b>

      If you wish to toggle in a simple light chaser to the front panel then here are some switch commands which can be used:

                            001000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
To restart the initial boot code (if it has not been overwritten) use the switch commands:
    <pre>HALT, 140000, LOAD ADDRESS, ENABLE, START
</pre>
    <p>
      If you plan to run the emulator repeatedly or for a project, consider downloading the emulator to your own machine or server.
      This will <b>significantly</b> speed any of the emulator disk accesses and response times. All files and emulator OS
      disks can be found in the top level folder of
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/">http://skn.noip.me/pdp11/</a></b> or in the zip file
      <b><a href="https://skn.noip.me/pdp11/pdp11.zip">pdp11.zip</a></b> Please note that browser security
      policy may prevent local emulator pages from booting disk images so please read the information in <b>StartChrome.cmd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in how the emulator works then you can browse the source files on
      <b><a href="https://github.com/paulnank/nankervis-pdp11-js">Github</a></b>.
      The main Javascript files are pdp11.js, fpp.js and iopage.js
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many PDP emulators out there and I have never seen what I consider to be a complete list. Some of the really interesting ones can be found by googling terms such as "vhdl pdp 11". However the gold standard is SIMH at
      <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">Trailing Edge</a>.
      A different approach to Javascript PDP 11 emulation can be found at
      <a href="http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pdp11/">www.pcjs.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that the first PDP 11 emulator would be SIM-11 written in FORTRAN before the first PDP 11/20 hardware was even built - see
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/birth.html"> How the PDP-11 Was Born</a>. There is more PDP 11 history at
      <a href="http://www.hampage.hu/pdp-11/main.html">www.hampage.hu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course if you want your own PDP 11/70 front panel you might consider a
      <a href="http://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11">PiDP-11</a>.

      Happy emulating!

<meta name="twitter:title" content="3 Programming Books for Beginner to Read in 2020">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Programming books can help you level up as a Developer, especially when you are getting started in Software Development or learning a new language.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://www.datastuff.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/library-869061_640.jpg">
<p>Be it an O’Reilly book, or some of the Computer Science classics, many <strong>programming books</strong> can help you level up in your <strong>career as a Developer</strong>. </p>
<p>This can be especially important when you are <strong>getting started</strong> in Software Development, or in a <strong>programming language</strong> like Python.</p>
<p>These last months have been quite heavy and stressful for many of us, what with the Apocalypse taking place and all that. </p>
<p>So why not take advantage of the situation, and use our newfound free time to double down on our studies and read some programming books?</p>
<p>This may be the time to be twice as productive. As <a href="http://paulgraham.com/gh.html?viewfullsite=1">Paul Graham</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (…), and in return, you’ll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, let’s see book number 1.</p>
<h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-2nd-ebook/dp/B07VSXS4NK/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Automate+the+Boring+Stuff+with+Python&amp;qid=1587355901&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=f895004eb4c2d8493cba066d43e4b256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwPi');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07VSXS4NK&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B07VSXS4NK" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>If you’re new to programming, there’s this very early stage when you’re still realizing the <strong>huge potential software can have</strong>, especially when applied to <strong>automation</strong>. </p>
<p>There’s a big difference between performing a simple task manually, and doing it a thousand times faster with a script.</p>
<p>There’s also a case to be made that <strong>Python is the best language to get started</strong> with Software Development, since its syntax and environments can be less daunting than C or Java. This way, you can spend less time doing this kind of “set up” things, freeing you up to focus on what’s important: solving actual problems.</p>
<p>I think <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> really sets itself apart from other programming books in this area: showing you from the get-go which <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/pythons-list-comprehensions-uses-and-advantages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typical day-to-day problems you can solve with Python scripts</a>, or with code, really. </p>
<p>From basic program flow and logic to more advanced tasks like <a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/programming/how-to-scrape-the-web-using-python-with-scrapy-spiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Scraping</a>, this book walks with you <strong>all the way from beginner to proficient</strong>, without holding your hand too much.</p>
<p>My favorite project from that book is the one on the chapter <strong><em>Handle the Clipboard Content</em></strong>, which teaches you how to copy and paste text programmatically, eventually making a <em>super-clipboard</em> which stores more than one text.</p>
<p>I have a personal attachment to this book, as I used it to learn Python when I was still in high school, deciding on whether to study Computer Science or not.</p>
<p>If you work in an office and you’re thinking of <strong>pivoting into programming</strong>, this book is for you.</p>
<p>Here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y">Automate the Boring Stuff</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Press-Thomas-Cormen-ebook/dp/B007CNRCAO/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cormen&amp;qid=1587356486&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=09fe74bb316b42a1559a9377aabc1f17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormeni');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B007CNRCAO&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007CNRCAO" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>To every Computer Science student, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/ItACormen');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is our bible.</p>
<p>This book has been <strong>sitting on my shelf for years</strong>. </p>
<p>It has helped me <strong>prepare for many exams</strong>, or whenever I need to <strong>brush up on Data Structures</strong> before an interview.</p>
<p>Especially if you’re planning to get into Software Development without getting a college degree, this book is a definite must-read.</p>
<p>This Computer Science book is the most comprehensive study of basic <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> you will find. </p>
<p>It covers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Algorithmic Complexity</strong> (with the best explanation of Big-O notation I’ve seen so far).</li><li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> (<em>many</em> sorting algorithms).</li><li><strong>Graphs</strong> and Graph-related Algorithms (especially Binary trees).</li><li><strong>Hash tables</strong> and hashing algorithms.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>, Greedy Algorithms, <strong>Divide-and-Conquer</strong> Algorithms.</li></ul>
<p>These topics and many others are explained in understandable terms, but with <strong>mathematical rigor and correctness</strong>. Not only that, but they often come up both in <strong>day-to-day work</strong>, and in <strong>interview problems</strong>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is a university level book, packed full with formal proofs and mathematical notation. </p>
<p>Even so, I think most developers will agree it is <strong>generally entertaining to read </strong>(<em>if you don’t find Data Structures fun, make sure you’re picking the right career!</em>), and explains most concepts really clearly and succinctly.</p>
<p>If you need to learn how a hash table works, or want to be able to build a binary search tree from scratch, or just need a quick brush up on sorting algorithms before an interview, this is the book for you.</p>
<p>As before, here’s a link to <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/Cormen');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-="">Cormen et al.’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> in Amazon.</p>
<p>And, speaking of interviews…</p>
<h2>Cracking the Code Interview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ctci&amp;qid=1587356024&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=strikingloo-20&amp;linkId=904a242e267cc92cfb582e366ee3e63a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCIi');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-=""><img src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0984782850&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=strikingloo-20"></a><img loading="lazy" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=strikingloo-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=0984782850" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p><p>Ok, hear me out here. If you’re starting from scratch, I think <a href="https://amzn.to/2yoYd2y" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/AtBSwP');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-="">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> is the most practical way to start learning Python and programming.</p>
<p>And if you want to <strong>dive deeper</strong> and learn more advanced or theoretical Computer Science concepts, like Algorithms and Data Structures, then <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2VktSLi">Cormen’s Introduction to Algorithms</a></em> is the undisputed book to go.</p>
<p>However, when all is said and done, there is a craftsmanship that you can only learn by doing, and practicing.</p>
<p>As Charles Darwin once said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have always maintained that, excepting fools, men did not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If that’s the stage where you feel you’re at, then the best thing you can do is <strong>practice a lot</strong>, with <strong>many different problems</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CtCI');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> (CTCI, for friends) has to offer.</p>
<p>Sure, the first chapter deals more with the “soft” aspects of a Software Interview (which, again, if you plan to apply for a SWE job eventually, then you should master those too!).</p>
<p>But the rest of the book? Chapter after chapter of <strong>fun, challenging problems</strong> taken straight out of Google’s, Microsoft’s or Facebook’s interview processes. And, they are divided into categories so you can practice one subject at a time.</p>
<p>Feel like you need to polish your <strong>bit manipulation</strong> skills? CTCI has a chapter for you.</p>
<p>Want to practice thinking on your feet and deciding which <strong>Data Structures</strong> fit each kind of problem setup? CTCI has you covered, too.</p>
<p>I did feel my <strong>Software Interview skills</strong> improved after reading CTCI and going through all its exercises. However, that’s definitely not the most important part. The most valuable thing I got from CTCI, is practice: hands-on practice, solving many different problems through code.</p>
<p>To get started, be sure to check out <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3bluxBO" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/CTCIf');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-="">Cracking the Code Interview</a></em> on Amazon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So far, I’ve made recommendations for:</p>
<ul><li>A very language-focused programming book for your first steps as a Developer.</li><li>A more academic or broader book for the more theoretically-oriented readers.</li><li>A last, very practical book with a lot of exercises for everyone, old and new to coding.</li></ul>
<p>Each of these programming books has helped me learn a lot. Some have saved my skin on more than one occasion -or exam!-. </p>
<p>When I am preparing for an interview, or a tough exam, there are no other books I’d rather have <em>(though, if you read this far and are thinking ‘hey, he didn’t mention &lt;book_name&gt;!’ this is your time to shine! Hit me up in the comments and I’ll make sure to add it to my reading list)</em>.</p>
<p>I hope at least some of these books will be as helpful to you or your programmer friends, too!</p>
<p>Have you already read any of these books? Are you reading any of them? Let me know what you think of them in the comments! </p>
<p>I’d love to know your opinion, both if you liked them or not. Especially if you can offer a recommendation for what you think is a better alternative!</p>
<p>If you want to get into Data Science or Machine Learning, check out my older post <em><a href="https://www.datastuff.tech/data-science/3-machine-learning-books-that-helped-me-level-up-as-a-data-scientist/" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; urchinTracker('/endMLB');" data-cf-modified-06a5acbff00a9cf6d06de0f9-="">Machine Learning Books to Level Up as a Data Scientists</a></em>.</p>
<p>We can also discuss these books on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/strikingloo">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@strikingloo">Medium</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="http://dev.to/strikingloo">dev.to</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested.<br>I want to hear your opinions!</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/only-intrinsic-motivation-lasts/">I left my job at Amazon to work for myself</a>. I’m no longer an employee, but if I were ever to become one again, here’s what I’ll keep in mind.</p>



<h3 id="mce_4">Many things won’t be within my control.</h3>



<p>Getting promoted, getting a raise, getting recognized, getting on an important project — these are all things that an employee can never fully control, regardless of the effort made. Some people I worked with made their well-being dependent on these things. I tried not to. It’s normal to be disappointed by undesirable outcomes, but I try to avoid having externally controlled outcomes play a role in my satisfaction and self-esteem.</p>



<h3>My satisfaction comes from challenges, not from outcomes.</h3>



<p>Most companies function by setting goals and holding people accountable for the outcomes. The problem is, I don’t consider myself to be goal-driven. I don’t set goals for myself; I cannot remember ever setting one. I have targets, but I don’t try to hold myself accountable for the outcomes. Employers, however, care a lot about outcomes, and as an employee I always wanted to do my best to deliver what my employer wanted. So my approach was to mentally transform the company’s goals into small daily challenges. Tackling a challenge, brainstorming solutions, trying my best, finding an easy way out — doing those things can give me satisfaction regardless of the outcome. It’s the journey that matters to me, not the outcome, and the journey is just a stream of daily challenges coupled with my best attempts to tackle them.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Trying to get promoted is the fastest way not to get promoted.</h3>



<p>Promotions are usually the biggest carrot that employers dangle in front of employees to “motivate them”. A promotion doesn’t cost the employer anything, which is definitely not the case for other motivational incentives, such as a bonus, or a day off. Luckily for the employer, employees tend to want promotions a lot — probably more than they want bonuses and days off. However, once again, promotions are outcomes controlled by many variables and by random subjective people. They are never really in the employee’s control. My trick was not to desire one. I never asked my manager what I needed to do to get a promotion, I never asked to discuss my career plan, I never looked for a career mentor, I never tried to impress those that would be evaluating me — nothing of that sort. I just focused on the things in my control: doing the best work I could, as if it were my own company, and treating others how I wanted to be treated.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">The company’s opinions are not necessarily my opinions.</h3>



<p>Being a good employee is like being a lawyer acting for a client. The lawyer’s job is to make the best case for the client, regardless of what the lawyer might think. My job as an employee was to do the best work I could, the way the company wanted, based on the values and opinions of the company. Just like the lawyer, I would occasionally voice my opinion privately when we didn’t see things entirely eye to eye. But it was always on me to disagree and commit. And also just like the lawyer, there were always moral and legal lines I wouldn’t cross. But as long as I held the job, I carried out my duty. For example, whenever I talked to customers, I always gave them the company’s opinion of the products, not my own. That’s how it’s supposed to be. If I were to employ people, that’s what I would want them to do.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Meaningless work is the cost of doing business.</h3>



<p>Most policies, processes, and procedures that I’ve been subject to by my employers had things in them that I thought were completely meaningless, and that I wouldn’t do if I were in charge. This work was the hardest type for me to do, especially when it carried on for days, weeks, and months. The bigger the company and the more distant the policy-makers are from the makers, the more of this you can expect. The best mechanism I found to convince my procrastinating self to persevere with this work was to think of it as a cost of doing business, rather than a purposeless task. That simple mental switch suddenly gives it meaning in the complex universe of a company.</p>



<h3 id="mce_2">Rewards kill my enthusiasm.</h3>



<p>I never liked having incentives dangled in front of me, and I don’t trust people that tell me: If you do this, you’ll get that. I’ve hated this for as long as I can remember, because it always feels like somebody is trying to control me or trying to change my behavior. I respond very negatively to the perception of being controlled, so as much as I can, I try to avoid such environments. When I can’t do that, I try to ignore the incentives, and just focus on the things that I can control, such as doing the best work that I can. This has helped me to find peace of mind in environments filled with carrots and sticks.</p>



<h3 id="mce_20">Only intrinsic motivation lasts.</h3>



<p>There are things that I feel intrinsically driven to do, even when there’s no incentive or punishment compelling me to do them. The best kind of work for me is work driven by this intrinsic energy. I might be doing other things, but I would always be looking for opportunities that allow me to spend more time on work driven by my intrinsic motivation. My last job was very good by every measure, but once I discovered an alternative path that would allow me to use my intrinsic motivation more, it became practically impossible for me to stay. If I were to become an employee again, I’d be very careful not to let the extrinsic rewards distort how I measure job opportunities. Once I attain a certain level of financial security, the satisfaction from rewards wears off quickly, and only intrinsic motivation lasts.</p>

    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/TI99-IMG_7143.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A"></p>
<p>When I was around 13-14 years old, home computers were just appearing
on the market.  The first machines that I remember to have been sold
in the large department stores in Berlin were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">Atari 400 and
800</a> as well as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a>.
At the time, these machines were incredibly expensive, but me and my
friends often hung out in the stores to play around with these
machines and dream of owning them.</p>
<p>I found the TI-99/4A to be very good looking with its late 1970ies US
design and its nice keyboard.  In magazines I read that the machine
was slow and crippled, though, and the british home computers were
much cheaper, so I never became friends with the TI back then.</p>
<p>Recently, I found a machine cheaply on sale on an auction site and
bought it, despite the fact that neither the power supply nor the TV
modulator was included with the system.  The power brick was easy to
buy separately and I thought that I would not want the TV modulator
anyway.  I figured that the (european) TI outputs a component (YPbPr)
video signal and decided to try some conversion circuits that I found
on the Internet until I got something that one of my monitors could
display.</p>
<p>The first two attempts that I made failed, though.  One of the
schematics I had was a generic YPbPr conversion circuit based on a
bunch of opamps.  It did not produce a picture at all, but not knowing
enough about video signal encoding I did not manage to debug the
problem.  The same happened with another schematic that supposedly was
specifically designed for the TI-99/4A, but did not work for me
either.  Finally, I run across a new adapter circuit called
<a href="https://tms-rgb.com/">TMS-RGB</a> designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/npiegdon">Nicholas
Piegdon</a> just this year.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-pcb.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB PCB"></p>
<p>The TMS-RGB is a generic RGB converter for systems using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">TMS9929A</a>
chip, i.e. the TI-99/4A, some MSX systems and the ColecoVision.  It is
a tightly packed PCB with surface mounted components meant to be
soldered onto the solder side of the PCB of the machine to be
converted.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-on-ti.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB mounted on TI-99/4A board"></p>
<p>To me, getting the PCB fabricated in China, sourcing the components
and soldering them onto the board with a microscope was part of the
fun.  It was not all that easy, though, and the TMS-RGB website has
some shops listed that sell the board ready for installation.
Installing it in the machine is very easy thanks to the excellent
videos published on the site.</p>
<p>The TMS-RGB converts the YPrPb signal to RGB + Sync, but it does not
change the overall timing.  This means that one either needs a monitor
that can deal with TV format RGB signals (i.e. one that has a RGB
SCART Input or a CBM 1084), or an upscaler that converts the signal to
match the expectations of a more modern computer monitor.  I bought a
cheap GBS-8200 upscaler board which produces a VGA output and it
worked fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/ti-and-upscaler.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A board and GNS-8200 upscaler"></p>
<p>In fact, the picture quality that I get with this on my TFT monitor is
just awesome.  The pixels are crisp and the is no blur, jail bars or
ghosting.  I can recommend the TMS-RGB board to anyone who wants to
equip their TMS9929A based hardware with a better video output.  The
overall cost for the PCB's, components and the upscaler board was
around 70 Euros.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So the other day I both defined Tcl procedures all by myself and used them interactively, and I liked it, to the point where it felt like some kind of local optimum. This entry is an attempt to cope with the trauma of liking Tcl, by means of rationalizing it. I'll first tell the story of my fascinating adventures, and then I'll do the rationalizing (to skip the oh-so-personal first part, go straight for the bullet points).</p>
<p>Here's what I was doing. I have this board. The board has a chip on it. The chip has several processors in it. There's a processor in there that is a memory-mapped device, and I talk to it using CPU load/store commands. The CPU is itself a JTAG target, and I talk to it via a probe, issuing those load/store commands. To the probe I talk via USB using an ugly console that can't even handle the clipboard properly. The console speaks Tcl.</p>
<p>Net result: in order to talk to the memory-mapped processor, I have to speak Tcl. Or I can use a memory view window in a graphical debugger. Except some addresses will change the processor state when read (pop an item from a LIFO, that sort of thing). So no, memory view windows aren't a good idea – you have to aim for the specific address, not shoot at whole address ranges. Damn, just who thought of defining the hardware in such a stupid way? Why, it was me. Little did I know that I was thereby inflicting Tcl on myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's this bug I have to debug now, and as far as I know it could be in at least three different pieces of software or in two different pieces of hardware, and I don't like any of the 5 options very much, and I want to find out what it is already. So at the ugly probe console I type things like <code>word 0x1f8cc000</code> (reads the processor status), <code>word 0x1f8cc008 2</code> (halts the execution), <code>word 0x1f8cc020 0x875</code> (places a breakpoint). I get sick and tired of this in about 2 minutes, when the command history is large enough to make the probability of hitting Enter at the wrong auto-completed command annoying. It's annoying to run the wrong command because if I ruin the processor state, it will take me minutes to reproduce that state, because the program reads input via JTAG, which is as slow as it gets.</p>
<p>So I figure this isn't the last bug I'm gonna deal with this way, and it's therefore time for Extending my Environment, equipping myself with the Right Tools for the Job, Tailored to my needs, utilizing the Scripting capabilities of the system. I hate that, I really do. Is there something more distressing than the development of development tools for the mass market of a single developer? Can a programmer have a weakness more pathetic than the tendency to solve easy generic meta-problems when the real, specific problems are too hard? Is there software more disgusting in nature than plug-ins and extensions for a butt-ugly base system? But you know what, I really fail to remember 0x1f8cwhat the breakpoint address is. This story has one hexadecimal value too much for my brain. OK, then. Tcl.</p>
<p>I decided to have one entry point procedure, <code>pmem</code>, that would get a memory-mapped processor id, 'cause there are many of them, and then call one of several functions with the right base address, so that <code>pmem 0 pc</code> would do the same as <code>pmem_pc 0x1f8c0000</code>. Well, in Tcl that's as simple as it gets. Tcl likes to generate and evaluate command strings. More generally, Tcl likes strings. In fact, it likes them more than anything else. In normal programming languages, things are variables and expressions by default. In Tcl, they are strings. <code>abc</code> isn't a variable reference – it's a string. <code>$abc</code> is the variable reference. <code>a+b/c</code> isn't an expression – it's a string. <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code> is the expression. Could you believe that? <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code>. Isn't that ridiculous?</p>
<p>In fact, that was one of my main applications for Tcl: ridiculing it. I remember reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130385603">the huge Tcl/Tk book by Brent Welch</a> with my friend once. There was a power outage and it was past the time when the last UPS squeaked its last squeak. And the book was there 'cause the hardware guys use it for scripting their lovecraftian toolchain. We really did have fun. Tears went down my cheeks from laughter. Even people with the usual frightened/mean comments about those geeks who laugh their brains out over a Tcl book  didn't spoil it. So, ridiculing Tcl, my #1 use for it. The other use is the occasional scripting of the hardware hackers' lovecraftian toolchain. Overall, I don't use Tcl very much.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Tcl is that it's still a dynamic language, and reasonably laconic at that, modulo quoting and escaping. So I enter the usual addictive edit/test cycle using <code>tclsh &lt; script</code>. N minutes down the road (I really don't know what N was), I've finished my 2 screenfuls of Tcl and the fun starts. I actually start debugging the goddamn thing.<br>
<code><br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
IDLE<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 0 0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 1 0xa57<br>
$ pmem 0 cmd run<br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
DEBUG<br>
$ pmem 0 pc<br>
0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 rstack<br>
3 return addresses<br>
addr 0: 0x0005<br>
addr 1: 0x05a8<br>
addr 2: 0x0766<br>
$ pmem 0 cmd stp<br>
$ pmem 0 pc<br>
0xc00<br>
</code></p>
<p><em>Weeee!</em> <em>HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!</em></p>
<p>You have no idea just how happy this made me. Yeah, I know, I'm overreacting. I'll tell you what: debug various kinds of hardware malfunction for several months, and you'll be able to identify with the warped notion of value one gains through such process. On second thought, I don't know if I'd really recommend it. Remember how I told <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html">low-level programming was easy</a>? It is, fundamentally, but there's this other angle from which it's quite a filthy endeavor. I promise to blog about it. I owe it to the people who keep telling me "so low-level is easy?" each time they listen to me swear heartily at a degenerate hardware setup where nothing works no matter what you try. I owe it to myself – me wants to reach a closure here. Why should I tolerate being regularly misquoted at the moments of my deepest professional catharsis?</p>
<p>Aaaanyway, in just N minutes, I bootstrapped myself something not unlike a retarded version of gdb, the way it would work if the symbol table of my program was stripped. But no matter – I have <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/addr2line1.html">addr2line</a> for that. And the nice thing about my retarded debugger front-end is that it looks like shell commands: <code>blah blah blah</code>. As opposed to <code>blah("blah","blah")</code>. And this, folks, is what I think Tcl, being a tool command language, gets right.</p>
<p>I come from the world of pop infix languages (C/Java/Python/Ruby/you name it). Tcl basically freaks me out with its two fundamental choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tcl likes literals, not variables.</strong> Tcl: <code>string, $var.</code> Pop infix: <code>"string", var</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tcl likes commands, not expressions.</strong> Tcl: <code>doit this that, [expr $this+$that]</code>. Pop infix: <code>doit("this","that"), this+that</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, pop infix languages (and I use the term in the most non-judgmental, factual way), pop infix languages are optimized for programming (duh, they are programming languages). Programming is definitions. Define a variable and it will be easy to use it, and computing hairy expressions from variables is also easy. Tcl is optimized for usage. Most of the time, users give simple commands. Command names and literal parameters are easy. If you are a sophisticated user, and you want to do <code>pmem 0 bkpt [expr [pmem 0 pc] + 1]</code>, go ahead and do it. A bit ugly, but on the other hand, simple commands are really, really simple.</p>
<p>And eventually, simple commands become all that matters for the user, because the sophisticated user grows personal shortcuts, which abstract away variables and expressions, so you end up with <code>pmem 0 bkpt nextpc</code> or something. Apparently, <em>flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about.</em></p>
<p>I'm not saying that I'm going to use Tcl as the extension language of my next self-made lovecraftian toolchain (I was thinking more along the lines of doing that one in D and using D as my scripting language, 'cause it compiles fast enough and it's apparently high-level enough). I haven't thought enough about this, but the grotesque escaping/quoting in Tcl still freaks me out; I don't want to <em>program</em> like that. All I'm saying is that I like the <em>interactive</em> part. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short code matters a lot; short interactive commands matter <strong>much</strong> more.</li>
<li>An interactive command language must be a real language (loops, functions and all).</li>
<li>Tcl allows for the shortest commands and it's a real language. I'm <em>fascinated</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Short code vs short commands</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people have noticed that keeping your code short is extremely important. More surprisingly, many people fail to notice this, probably because "1 line is better than 5" doesn't sound that convincing. OK, think about 100K lines vs 500K and you'll get the idea. Oh, there are also those dirty Perl/shell one-liners that make one doubt about this. I've known a Bastard Programmer that used 2K bash one-liners as his weapon of choice. OK then, so the actual rule must be "short code is good unless it's written by a bastard". But it's the same core idea.</p>
<p>So we have the Architect type, who loves lots of classes which delegate work to each other, and we have the Enlightened type, who wants to write and read less. And the Enlightened type can rant and rave all day how Python, or Ruby, or Lisp make it oh-so-easy to define data structure literals, or to factor out stuff using meta-programming, or some other thing an Architect just never gets. And I'm all with it.</p>
<p>And then we have interactive shells. And in Python it's <code>doit("xx","yy")</code>. And in Lisp it's <code>(doit "xx" "yy")</code>, or <code>(doit :xx :yy)</code>, or <code>(doit xx yy)</code> if you make it a macro. And in Ruby it's <code>doit :xx :yy</code>, if you use symbols and omit parens. And that's about as good as you can get without using your own parser as in <code>doit "xx yy"</code>, which can suck in the (more rare) case when you do need to evaluate expressions before passing parameters, and doesn't completely remove overhead. Also note how all these languages use (), which makes you press Shift, instead of [] which doesn't. Ruby and Perl let you omit (), …</p></div></div>

September 5, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/">archive.org</a>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-3/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we finished adding
the rest of the constants as tagged pointer immediates. Since it’s not very
useful to have only values (no way to operate on them), we’re going to add some
<em>primitive unary functions</em>.</p>

<p>“Primitive” means here that they are built into the compiler, so we won’t
actually compile the call to an assembly procedure call. This is also called a
<em>compiler intrinsic</em>. “Unary” means the functions will take only one argument.
“Function” is a bit of a misnomer because these functions won’t be real values
that you can pass around as variables. You’ll only be able to use them as
literal names in calls.</p>

<p>Though we’re still not adding a reader/parser, we can imagine the syntax for
this looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>integer?</span> <span>(</span><span>integer-&gt;char</span> <span>(</span><span>add1</span> <span>96</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Today we also tackle <em>nested</em> function calls and subexpressions.</p>

<p>Adding function calls will require adding a new compiler datastructure, an
addition to the AST, but <em>not</em> to the compiled code. The compiled code will
still only know about the immediate types.</p>

<p>Ghuloum proposes we add the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add1</code>, which takes an integer and adds 1 to it</li>
  <li><code>sub1</code>, which takes an integer and subtracts 1 from it</li>
  <li><code>integer-&gt;char</code>, which takes an integer and converts it into a character
(like <code>chr</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>char-&gt;integer</code>, which takes a character and converts it into an integer
(like <code>ord</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>null?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>nil</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>zero?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>0</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>not</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>false</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>integer?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is an integer and
false otherwise</li>
  <li><code>bool?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is a boolean and
false otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions <code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, and the <code>char</code>/<code>integer</code> conversion functions
will be our first real experience dealing with object encoding in the compiled
code. What fun!</p>

<p>The implementations for <code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>integer</code>?, and <code>bool?</code> are so
similar that I am only going to reproduce one or two in this post. The rest
will be visible at
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/tekknolagi.github.com/blob/3d956655e48a124e828a8847282caa71b1c8b63f/assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c">assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c</a>.</p>

<p>In order to implement these functions, we’ll also need some more instructions
than <code>mov</code> and <code>ret</code>. Today we’ll add:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add</code></li>
  <li><code>sub</code></li>
  <li><code>shl</code></li>
  <li><code>shr</code></li>
  <li><code>or</code></li>
  <li><code>and</code></li>
  <li><code>cmp</code></li>
  <li><code>setcc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the implementations of <code>shl</code>, <code>shr</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>and</code> are so
straightforward — just like <code>mov</code>, really — I’ll also omit them from the
post. The implementations of <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>cmp</code>, and <code>setcc</code> are more
interesting.</p>

<h3 id="the-fundamental-data-structure-of-lisp">The fundamental data structure of Lisp</h3>

<p>Pairs, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cells</a>,
two-tuples, and probably other things too, are the fundamental data structure
of Lisp. At least the original Lisp. Nowadays we have fancy structures like
vectors, too.</p>

<p>Pairs are a container for precisely two other objects. I’ll call them <code>car</code> and
<code>cdr</code> for historical<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and consistency reasons, but you can call them
whatever you like. Regardless of name, they could be represented as a C struct
like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is useful for holding pairs of objects (think coordinates, complex
numbers, …) but it is also incredibly useful for making linked lists. Linked
lists in Lisp are comprised of a <code>car</code> holding an object and the <code>cdr</code> holding
another list. Eventually the last <code>cdr</code> holds <code>nil</code>, signifying the end of the
list. Take a look at this handy diagram.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/lisp/03_lists_cons.svg">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cons cell list, courtesy of Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This represents the list <code>(list 42 69 613)</code>, which can also be denoted <code>(cons
42 (cons 69 (cons 613 nil)))</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll use these lists to represent the syntax trees for Lisp, so we’ll need to
implement pairs to compile list programs.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-pairs">Implementing pairs</h3>

<p>In previous posts we implemented the immediate types the same way in the
compiler and in the compiled code. I originally wrote this post doing the same
thing: manually laying out object offsets myself, reading and writing from
objects manually. The motivation was to get you familiar with the memory
layout in the compiled code, but ultimately it ended up being too much content
too fast. We’ll get to memory layouts when we start allocating pairs in the
compiled code.</p>

<p>In the compiler we’re going to use C structs instead of manual memory layout.
This makes the code a little bit easier to read. We’ll still tag the pointers,
though.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kPairTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span><span>;</span>        <span>// 0b001</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>0x7</span><span>);</span>  <span>// 0b000...0111</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>~</span><span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b1111...1000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds the pair tag and some masks. As we noted in the previous posts, the
heap object tags are all in the lowest three bits of the pointer. We can mask
those out using this handy utility function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>uword</span> <span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>obj</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll need to use this whenever we want to actually access a struct member.
Speaking of struct members, here’s the definition of <code>Pair</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here are some functions for allocating and manipulating the <code>Pair</code> struct,
to keep the implementation details hidden:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>tag</span><span>,</span> <span>uword</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There a couple important things to note.</p>

<p>First, <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> very intentionally zeroes out the memory it allocates.
If the members were left uninitialized, it might be possible to read off a
struct member that had an invalid pointer in <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code>. If we
zero-initialize it, the member pointers represent the object <code>0</code> by default.
Nothing will crash.</p>

<p>Second, we keep moving our <code>ASTNode</code> pointers through <code>AST_as_pair</code>. This
function has two purposes: catch invalid uses (via the <code>assert</code> that the object
is indeed a <code>Pair</code>) and also mask out the lower bits. Otherwise we’d have to do
the masking in every operation individually.</p>

<p>Third, I abstracted out the <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> so we don’t expose the <code>calloc</code>
function everywhere. This allows us to later swap out the allocator for
something more intelligent, like a bump allocator, an arena allocator, etc.</p>

<p>And since memory allocated must eventually be freed, there’s a freeing function
too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>AST_is_heap_object</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>free</span><span>((</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assumes that each <code>ASTNode*</code> owns the references to all of its members. So
<strong>don’t borrow references</strong> to share between objects. If you need to store a
reference to an object, <strong>make sure you own it</strong>. Otherwise you’ll get a double
free. In practice this shouldn’t bite us too much because each program is one
big tree.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-symbols">Implementing symbols</h3>

<p>We also need symbols! I mean, we could try mapping all the functions we need to
integers, but that wouldn’t be very fun. Who wants to try and debug a program
crashing on <code>function#67</code>? Not me. So let’s add a datatype that can represent
names of things.</p>

<p>As above, we’ll need to tag the pointers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x5</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 0b101</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then our struct definition.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>cstr</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve chosen this variable-length object representation because it’s similar to
how we’re going to allocate symbols in assembly and the mechanism in C isn’t so
gnarly. This struct indicates that the memory layout of a <code>Symbol</code> is a length
field immediately followed by that number of bytes in memory. Note that having
this variable array in a struct is a <strong>C99 feature</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have C99 or don’t like this implementation, that’s fine. Just
store a <code>char*</code> and allocate another object for that string.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could also opt to not store the length <em>at all</em> and instead NUL-terminate
it. This has the advantage of not dealing with variable-length arrays (it’s
just a tagged <code>char*</code>) but has the disadvantage of an <code>O(n)</code> length lookup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can add our <code>Symbol</code> allocator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>

<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>data_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>strlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// for NUL</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>kSymbolTag</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>Symbol</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>
  <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cstr</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>node</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how we have to manually specify the size we want. It’s a little fussy, but
it works.</p>

<p>Storing the NUL byte or not is up to you. It saves one byte per string if you
don’t, but it makes printing out strings in the debugger a bit of a pain since
you can’t just treat them like normal C strings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some Lisp implementations use a <em>symbol table</em> to ensure that symbols
allocated with equivalent C-string values return <em>the same pointer</em>. This
allows the implementations to test for symbol equality by testing pointer
equality. I think we can sacrifice a bit of memory and runtime speed for
implementation simplicity, so I’m not going to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s add the rest of the utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

    <p>This was originally posted on my personal blog in 2012.  It's still highly relevent today.</p>

<p>Who this is for: developers who have an idea.</p>

<p>Why you should read it: so you don’t waste your life by building something nobody wants.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make: I’m 35, and until last year, I started building companies by creating a product.</p>

<p>Last year, when starting SocialWOD, my biz partner Ryan refused to write code without first talking to 20+ customers and getting commitments to pay us money for a solution to a well-defined problem of theirs.</p>

<p>Having gone down the “build first” path enough without significant success, I was up for trying a new approach. Conceptually it seemed to make sense that we’d be able to better solve our customers’ problems if we understood their problems better.</p>

<p>To boot, we decided not to build until we had verbal financial commitments from customers for our proposed solution.</p>

<p>The result? <strong>We were able to charge money from day one for a two-screen CRUD app. We were able to do so because we had honed in on a specific problem worth paying for, and we had financial commitments before we wrote a single line of app code.</strong></p>

<p>Read on for some of the hard-earned lessons that’ll help you grow your biz.</p>
      <h2 id="dont-build-first">
        
        
          Don’t build first <a href="#dont-build-first">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<p>Building first puts you at a disadvantage. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Your job as an entrepreneur is to increase the odds that your business will succeed. Put another way, your job is to reduce the risks that prevent your venture from succeeding.</p>

<p>There are several types of risk that can kill your company.</p>

<p>Big ones include (but aren’t limited to):</p>

<p>– Team (are <em>we</em> the right people to execute)
– Market (do people want to buy it) ← usually the biggest risk
– Technology (can we build it) ← most hackers start here. Oops.</p>

<p>I’m gonna talk about why most hackers start reducing the technology risk (by building a product) when they should start by reducing the market risk.</p>

<p>And I’m going to give you a script you can use in interviews to learn more about the market side of your biz.</p>

      </h2>

<p>If you’re a developer, writing code is the fun part.  Code can be bent to your will to do what you want it to do. You know when it works, and when it doesn’t. It’s clean.</p>

<p>People have an innate desire for control, and code can be controlled.</p>

<p>Code is your comfort zone, so it’s what you (and I!) fall back on.</p>

<p>But since you can build almost certainly build the solution, it’s almost always the wrong place to start.</p>

      </h3>

<blockquote>“A hacker who has learned what to make, and not just how to make, is extraordinarily powerful.” – Paul Graham</blockquote>

<p>You should start by understanding your market.</p>

<p>This is vague. More precisely, you should understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who your customers are</li>
  <li>the specific problem your potential customers have</li>
  <li>why this is a problem for them</li>
  <li>how painful this problem is for them</li>
  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to do this is by talking to real live people: picking up the phone, going out to coffee, etc, asking good questions, and listening.</p>

<p>For most hackers, talking to customers to figure out their unmet needs is scary, and always messier than code. It’s out of your comfort zone.</p>

<p>The rational response is “Righty-o! Talk to customers first – that makes sense.”</p>

<p>The emotional response is “Oh shit. Who should I talk to? What should I say? Won’t I just be better off building this feature?”</p>

<p>The way I overcome this emotional trauma is to think about the insights I’ve gleaned from talking to customers in the past, and more importantly: <strong>how much time and frustration these conversations have saved me. Hackers hate working on stuff nobody uses.</strong></p>

<p>Really, it’s simple: the fastest way to build something people want is to understand their problems. And the fastest way to understand their problems is to listen to what they have to say.</p>

<p>Here’s an template of an email we used at SocialWOD when referred to potential customers (we make software for CrossFit Gyms)</p>

<blockquote>Hi First_name,<p>

  <li>what happens when the problem is not solved</li>
  <li>how they are currently solving this problem, and what else they’ve tried</li>
  <li>how much this problem, when solved, is worth to them</li>
  <li>how they find out about solutions to this problem</li>
  <li>the words your customers to describe this problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you had an idea about product for movie theater owners that would pipe buttered popcorn (and other) smells into theaters to help drive concession sales.</p>

<p>Here’s the sort of questions I would ask a theater owner:</p>

<p>Q: Tell me about your business. What are your biggest problems? What keeps you up at night? Why?</p>

<p>Trying to learn:
What are the big problems they have in their biz? Why are they problems? What happens when those problems aren’t solved?</p>

<p>Q: What are the key metrics that drive your business?
Trying to learn: What are the key levers in their biz – concession dollars per ticket sold? Straight up ticket sales? etc. Is your solution potentially a must-have or a nice to have?</p>

<p>Q: (if they don’t mention concessions) What impact do concessions have on your business?
Trying to learn: Is your solution even potentially valuable to them? How much, or why not? (Make sure you understand this. Keep unpeeling the onion; make sure you understand this fully. Try not to make assumptions here.)</p>

<p>Q: Have you looked at anything to help you with this problem? How have they worked for you? Where did you find them?
Trying to learn: Learning what else is out there? Are those solutions working, or not? What distribution channels might you need to be in?</p>

<p>Q: I have some ideas about products that might be useful. Can I give you a 1-liner description and you tell me if we’re crazy or may be on to something?
Trying to learn: This is to get a sense of whether your idea may even be valuable to them… you don’t want to get into specifics really, just tease them and get high-level feedback.</p>
    
      <h2 id="also-ask">
        
        
          Also ask: <a href="#also-ask">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>

<ul>
  <li>Is it ok if I follow up as we develop our ideas? (I’ve never had anybody say no to this)</li>
  <li>Is there anybody else who you think we should speak to who have the same kinds of problems you do? (these are the people you call next)</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal with these interviews is to <em>listen</em> and <em>learn</em>, not to sell. Learn where you’re right, where you’re wrong, what words your customers use, what big problems they have, and how you can adapt your solution to solve those problems.</p>

<p>After a couple interviews you’ll be able to provide insight and become valuable to the people you’re speaking with, which makes you
even more trusted (“oh we just spoke to person XYZ at ABC corp… he was feeling the same pain, you’re not alone!” OR BETTER “just spoke to XYZ at ABC… he solved the problem you’re facing by doing 123”.)</p>

<p>And after 10-20 of these you’ll know a crap ton more about your market, and whether this is a problem even worth your time.</p>

<p>This process isn’t easy. But recurring themes will emerge that will help you hone in on a problem worth solving without writing a single line of code. The reason you do this first is because you need to do this whether you write code. You might as well do this <em>before</em> you spend a few months writing code, so you can figure out what to build.</p>

<p>Now that you better understand the problem and market, the next post will cover what you can do with that information (hint: it’s not “build the product”).</p>

	<p>I bet everybody knows this feeling when you get an interesting idea in your head, and 
you think – that is it! I need to do it! You start to dig into, but the first Google 
request shows that somebody has already implemented it. Bummer. I had one of those ideas
the other day.</p>

<p>Since around a year or a bit more, I am into running. For tracking my running time and 
routes I am using an application, of course. It is nice to look at some statistics. After
one of the runs, I looked at the route, and it reminded me of some figure or a drawing.
And then a thought came to me – what if we draw something  on a map while running using a 
GPS tracker?! Just imagine: a whole community running and sharing their routes!</p>

<p>My first deliberate attempt to draw during running was a letter “M“. It is supposed to be 
the first letter in either my wife’s name, or in the word “Metallica“. I’m not sure yet.</p>

<div>
	<figure>

	</figure>
</div>

<p>As it turned out, I am not the only one to come up with this idea. Drawing on a map with 
a GPS tracker is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing">GPS Art</a>. It originated in 90s, and, of course, became more 
popular with a spread of mobile GPS devices. Check out hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gpsart&amp;src=typed_query">#gpsart</a>
on Twitter for inspiration.</p>

<p>The community also has its heroes. For example, the largest drawings on Earth belong to
Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi. Here is a word “peace“… <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1nDdvPvZtyeh0a6uOxGTu7rEzRqI&amp;ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C26.488384499999995&amp;z=2">60,794 km long</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
			<img src="https://guzalexander.com/static/img/posts/gpsart_peace.png" alt="">
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>And here is “Marry Me“ <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&amp;mid=1m8Sevf2iWZT83ax5x2q6n8P8tBY&amp;ll=38.29853440547071%2C137.199813859375&amp;z=6">over the whole Japan</a>.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
			<img src="https://guzalexander.com/static/img/posts/gpsart_marryme.jpg" alt="">
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>You can check out more of his work at <a href="http://gpsdrawing.info/">http://gpsdrawing.info/</a>.</p>

<p>But anyway, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So I guess I just go 
put my running shoes on and take a bunch of those single steps for now.</p>

						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>After years of using LibreOffice, I’ve now switched over to ONLYOFFICE and recommend it over any other office suite on Linux. Now I know a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> enthusiasts will be unhappy about the idealistic part of the recommendation, but hear me out.</p>



<h2><strong>Top notch Microsoft Office compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>I’m a<a href="https://jatan.space/"> science writer</a> who uses Linux because it just functions better for me than Windows or macOS and because I’m an open source enthusiast. Given my profession, I have to frequently collaborate with people on other operating systems who almost always use either Microsoft Office or Google Docs. After three years of trying, I can tell you that LibreOffice just doesn’t cut it. Either me or the other person will lose some formatting in the documents at some point. And as a document travels from one computer to another, things quickly become a mess.</p>



<p>That is when I found ONLYOFFICE. In over a year of using it, I’ve sent ONLYOFFICE created documents, spreadsheets and presentations to people using Microsoft Office, iWork, smartphone editors, Google Docs, etc., did multiple to and fro edits and it hasn’t broken <em>a single thing</em>! This is something I cannot ignore as a writer and my experience attests to ONLYOFFICE’s claim of top notch Microsoft Office compatibility.</p>



<h2><strong>More features</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond the excellent compatibility with Microsoft Office files, there are other features that make ONLYOFFICE a better alternative to LibreOffice, WPS or any other Linux office suite that I’ve used.</p>



<ul><li>All documents open in the same window as multiple tabs and you can manipulate them just like you’d in a browser. This is amazing.</li><li>Can connect to Nextcloud or OwnCloud for online and collaborative features like Google Docs.</li><li>Unlike LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE has adequately functional and maintained mobile &amp; tablet apps on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onlyoffice.documents">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onlyoffice-documents/id944896972">iOS</a>.</li><li>Has Ribbon UI, so in my opinion things are easier to find on ONLYOFFICE compared to LibreOffice’s <strong>“Default”</strong> UI.</li><li>Open source, making it more trustworthy than WPS Office and other proprietary solutions on Linux.</li><li>Available on Windows and macOS too if you don’t want to use Microsoft Office or simply can’t afford its licensing fee.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Go get it</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200" alt="" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=400 400w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></figure></div>



<p>ONLYOFFICE is officially available to <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-desktop.aspx">download</a> on Linux as a Deb, RPM, Flatpak and a Snap package so you can use it on any Linux distro you like!</p>



<p>I hope I’ve convinced you to give ONLYOFFICE a shot and see if it solves your problems. If it doesn’t, you can file bugs and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors">their GitHub repository</a>. In my experience, they’ve been very open to feature suggestions and prompt on bug fixes.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>My ideals for FOSS dwindled swiftly when I had to make something work in the real world. Not everyone can use everything truly FOSS all the time. At least ONLYOFFICE is open source (<a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors/blob/master/LICENSE">AGPL-3.0, specifically</a>) and not proprietary like Microsoft Office. Bottomline, ONLYOFFICE is a fantastic office suite that I hope more people discover.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>(Updated 2020-09-06 with pointers to related work and a bit more explanation)</p>

<p>This is a bit of a followup to <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/personal/2018/05/10/toward-gpu-json-parsing.html">Towards GPGPU JSON parsing</a>. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more GPU programming experience under my belt, I don’t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem.</p>

<p>This post is a writeup of a new idea, but with a caution, no implementation. It probably contains some mistakes, and maybe the idea is flawed. But if it holds up, I think it’s an exciting line of research on how to port sequential algorithms to GPU.</p>

<p>For this post, I’m going to pose an even more simplified version of the problem: for each open bracket, record the index of the parent in the parse tree, and for each close bracket, the index of the corresponding open bracket.</p>

<p>This is a simple sequential program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>stack</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>None</span><span>]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>token</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span><span>:</span>
        <span>result</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>stack</span><span>[</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>stack</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>]</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>'['</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
        <span>elif</span> <span>token</span> <span>==</span> <span>']'</span><span>:</span>
            <span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To follow the running example from the JSON post, assume the input <code>[[][[][][[]]][][]]</code>. The result is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>index 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
input [  [  ]  [  [  ]  [  ]  [  [  ]  ]  ]  [  ]  [  ]  ]
value -  0  1  0  3  4  3  6  3  8  9  8  3  0 13  0 15  0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Can it be parallelized? It’s challenging to see how, as there are dependencies on previous state. Further, the state itself has unbounded size. It can be O(n); a pathological case is a million open brackets followed by a million close. In practice, depending on the workloads, we might expect more modest nesting depth, but ideally we’d like an algorithm that can handle all cases at least reasonably well.</p>

<p>Maybe we can do something. To longtime readers of my blog (and the “rope science” series before that), it will be no surprise I’ll try to use monoids.</p>

<p>So let’s turn this sequential program into a monoid. If I had a time portal, I’d lens forward in time and use the handy automated tool that some enterprising PhD student will has done by then. But, failing that, I’ll do it in my head.</p>

<p>The monoid is basically a sequence of pops followed by a sequence of pushes. Since the pop operations (in this case) don’t have a payload, they can be represented simply as a count. So the monoid is the pair <code>(n_pops, elements)</code>. The primitive for push is <code>(0, [element])</code>, and for pop it’s <code>(1, [])</code>. The monoid operation is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>combine</span><span>(</span><span>m1</span><span>,</span> <span>m2</span><span>):</span>
    <span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>s1</span> <span>=</span> <span>m1</span>
    <span>n2</span><span>,</span> <span>s2</span> <span>=</span> <span>m2</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>n2</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span> <span>+</span> <span>n2</span> <span>-</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>),</span> <span>s2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>n1</span><span>,</span> <span>s1</span><span>[:</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s1</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>n2</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>s2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And of course, the identity element is <code>(0, [])</code>. One intuition for this monoid is that it represents a function from the state at the beginning of a sequence of tokens to the state at the end. If it indeed computes this function for arbitrary subsequences, then it it follows that it’s a monoid from the fact that function composition is associative.</p>

<p>Running scan, or generalized <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/04/30/prefix-sum.html">prefix sum</a>, on this monoid, will result in the desired result at the top of the stack, i.e. the last element of the sequence in the monoid.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that this monoid is associative.</p>

<p>I do believe that an automated tool for translating these kinds of simple sequential programs is possible, and that there’s a theory behind it that illuminates ways in which monoids do and do not compose. Some composition is possible, for example you could fairly easily extend this idea so that each child knows its sequence number relative to its siblings. To do that, blend in the “counting monoid,” which is just integer addition.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Extend the monoid to handle sequence numbers.</p>

<p>If we had a bound on stack depth, we’d be pretty well set. The problem is the unbounded case. My original thinking was to have a window of (let’s say size k) elements, and each pass would handle a slice of the stack of size k. I think this can be made to work, but at heart it requires a number of passes proportional to stack depth, so in the worst case O(n^2).</p>

<p>My new idea is to retain the single pass scan, but use a purpose-built data structure to represent the stack. At the top is a window of k elements, then after that is a linked list (or perhaps a linked list of chunks; honestly I haven’t worked through all the implications, much less actually implemented and done performance measurement).</p>

<p>The combine operation tries to fit the new combined sequence in the window (up to a shared link, which it can just retain). But if it overflows, then it must allocate, most likely using an atomic bump allocator into global memory, as is often done in piet-gpu.</p>

<h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance analysis</h2>

<p>To do a <em>real</em> performance analysis would require an implementation, but it should be possible to reason about it a bit.</p>

<p>Clearly performance will be excellent if stack depth is shallow. The rate at which the linked list will be invoked will depend on the workload, and also the parallelism patterns. It’s worth noting that if the scan is run sequentially, then the linked list operations will always be cheap. This is because the concatenation at the heart of the monoid operation is <em>asymmetrical</em> when using a linked list - a large sequence on the left is cheap when the sequence on the right is small, but not the other way around. When running the scan purely sequentially, the monoid on the right is always of size 1 at most.</p>

<p>And the decoupled lookback implementation of scan, which is state of the art, runs essentially sequentially at large granularity; it just tries to exploit as much parallelism as the hardware provides at smaller granularity. Even with extremly deep nesting, it should build and retain a linked list of the stack as it scans, with a relatively smaller window for the part of the problem currently in flight.</p>

<p>There is another reason to be optimistic about performance. While the bandwidth of communication between partitions scales with the window size, that’s not necessarily true for processing <em>within</em> a partition. Putting aside for a moment the relatively challenging problem of implementing an efficient GPU kernel (which by necessity would exploit SIMD parallelism), consider a decoupled look-back implementation running on a more traditional multicore CPU, where each thread is sequential.</p>

<p>Basically, the first pass runs the traditional, sequential stack algorithm, with the modification that some of the input stack might not be available. At the end is the monoid, with “n_pops” being a count of the number of times that happened, and the sequence containing all the elements pushed inside that partition.</p>

<p>In the decoupled lookback phase, this monoid is published for consumption of partitions to the right, and the partition also computes the aggregate from partitions to the left. The cost of the monoid operations in this phase <em>will</em> be proportional to the size of the window, but keep in mind that the number of aggregates is orders of magnitude less than the number of elements.</p>

<p>Finally, in the second pass over the elements, the stack algorithm is run again, and this time elements that were missing in the first pass are available, from the aggregate obtained during the decoupled lookback phase. As another potential optimization, the second pass might “jump over” subtrees that were computed entirely locally within the partition in the first pass, only doing work on subtrees that cross partition boundaries.</p>

<p>Thus, my analysis is that the work factor is <em>extremely</em> good for this algorithm, meaning that on a 64 core processor, it might come within striking distance of 64 times faster than a single core sequential implementation (obviously modulo all the usual other factors that make this challenging).</p>

<p>As I mentioned, an efficient GPU kernel is likely to be challenging, probably requiring tricky techniques to exploit SIMD (warp) parallelism without spending too much time computing the monoid composition, but the fact that it seems to work so well in the multicore case is an encouraging sign that an efficient, fully GPU-tuned implementation is possible.</p>



<p>In an earlier draft, I asked for relevant literature related to this idea. I still haven’t found anything that presents this particular monoid, or a tool that can derive it from its sequential source, but there is a fair amount of related work.</p>

<p>Obviously, <a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is an important exploration of deriving more parallelism from the JSON parsing task, with impressive results. It is, I think, complementary to this exploration, as it exploits parallelism at a fine grain, where this monoid approach is geared towards the larger grain of tree structure. But both are necessary for a performant GPU implementation; anyone intending to really parse JSON on GPU is well advised to study it.</p>

<p>Parsing CSV has some of the same problems as JSON, though not the (potentially deeply) nested tree structure. A recent preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13415.pdf">ParPaRaw: Massively Parallel Parsing of Delimiter-Separated Raw Data</a> presents a GPU implementation.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/pull/1512">PR to cudf</a> implements “JSON Lines” parsing, which seems to me more similar to CSV than full tree-structured JSON parsing, but I haven’t dug into it in detail.</p>

<p>There is also a large literature on incremental parsing, which is related to parallel parsing as well (monoids are useful to both); a relevant example is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/efficient-parallel-and-incremental-parsing-of-practical-contextfree-languages/4D620F0BFADE2B588F854AAAEA252F5C">Efficient parallel and incremental parsing of practical context-free languages</a>.</p>

<p>I linked it in my previous blog, but <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24749">Aaron Hsu’s PhD thesis</a> is a remarkable full compiler implementation (for an APL-derived language) on GPU. It <em>does</em> address tree structure, and I believe generally uses adjacency matrices to represent that.</p>

<p>An interesting paper on converting a sequential program into a monoid is <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3018882.3018891">Functional Parallels of Sequential Imperatives</a>, and that has a lot of pointers into other literature. I haven’t (yet) read it carefully enough to know whether it could derive the monoid stated above. …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!

In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond

The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network

one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,

   <img alt="ADHD mind" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/adhdmind.png">
</p>

<p>This article took me four weeks to finish. During this time, I’ve had ideas for more than ten articles, started writing them in parallel, delaying this one so much that I almost gave up ever publishing it… It wasn’t until I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Distraction-Revised-Recognizing-Attention-ebook/dp/B005GFII62">Driven To Distraction</a> that I stumbled upon an explanation for why I was struggling to finish. Through this book and my doctor, I’ve discovered that I have a condition called Adult ADHD.</p>

<p>While the adult variant of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Adult_ADHD_Diagnostic_Expansion">recently</a> started to become a serious subject of research, it’s difficult to find testimonies about it related to work, in particular entrepreneurship. Early results show that there’s a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-018-0061-1">positive correlation between ADHD and the desire and act to start a company</a>. I’ll share how adult ADHD can affect a founder’s experience and how it played a role in the successes and stumbles of my life as the cofounder and CTO of <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<h2 id="backstory-and-the-entrepreneurship-drive">Backstory and the entrepreneurship drive</h2>

<p>From an early age, I had trouble remembering important things like my birthday (learned around age 7), how to tie shoes (learned age 12), or even why I entered a room in the first place (to this day, this keeps happening). All the way to the end of high school, getting good grades was easy. However, early signs of difficulty focusing popped up here and there: even when required to, I wasn’t able to sit down and learn. For example, in France, students must memorize entire poems, then are expected to recite it back the next day. As hard as I tried, when I stepped in front of the class my mind remained blank, unable to recall the words I had tried to learn the day before. The teacher, exasperated by my silence, called me “lazy” and “rebellious.”</p>

<p>After high school, I was accepted into the best schools in France. Difficulties focusing on homework became more problematic as advanced maths, physics, and chemistry required deeper focus and concentration to understand complex topics. My grades were now in the middle of the class instead of being at the top. For the first time, I started to feel the deep frustration of not being able to focus when I needed it.</p>

<p>As I started my professional life, things became more interesting. I was hired as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn and finally, it was an environment where my creativity could be unleashed. I suffered from “too-many-project-itis”, a made-up condition for engineers who start too many projects and finish too few. I learned to let go of most of them while focusing on the ones that would yield tangible results. Eventually, one of these ideas, a place to get verified information about people, motivated me enough to want to stop working at a big company and create a company that became a real startup: <a href="https://www.truework.com/">Truework</a>.</p>

<p>The pressure of long hours and stress to find product-market fit during early startup days pushed my mind to new highs and lows. What I thought were quirks of my personality quickly became signs that something in my brain was different than my peers. These inherent differences, while frustrating at times, also led to surprising successes for our business. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350878">Adult ADHD symptoms</a> fall into three categories as they relate to an entrepreneur’s experiences:  the <em>Good</em>, the <em>Bad</em>, and the <em>Ugly</em>. Just like in the famous scene they will, throughout your life, face each other or even duel at times: it’s your responsibility to have the “Good” win.</p>

<p>
   <img alt="Scene from the good, the bad and the ugly" src="https://www.kabdebon.com/assets/images/posts/2020-08-25-creative-mayhem-life-as-founder-with-adhd/thegoodthebadtheugly.jpg">
</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>“The bad” are the parts of ADHD that are not pleasant to deal with, for you or others. These behaviors, if not dealt with, will be a challenge to your success as an entrepreneur.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Anxiety</strong>. <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.4.716?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;">Research shows that close to one in two people with ADHD suffer from some kind of anxiety disorder</a>. As with most ADHD symptoms, it’s hard to predict how anxiety will show up in your life. For me, it’s heightened stress during unexpected events, like the departure of a key employee or a serious bug in the code. In these moments, I need to remind myself that it’s OK and surround myself with people who can keep their heads on their shoulders. 
In fact, to cope with anxiety, I’ve built a comprehensive incident management system that we use daily at Truework. Research has a name for it: <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/10/three-leadership-skills-that-c">productive paranoia</a>, an attribute that distinguishes companies that thrive in chaos instead of suffering from it. Anxiety is rarely talked about in entrepreneurship stories, but in my experience is very common. If channeled constructively, it’ll help build defense mechanisms for when bad news strikes. Remember, the journey to build a business is a rocky one and it’ll certainly trigger intense moments of anxiety and doubts.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of filter</strong>. “insensitive”, “harsh”, “direct”: if you have ADHD, you’ve probably heard these comments about your behavior. For founders, the difference between a successful outcome and a disastrous one often lies in how carefully you choose your words. Over time I’ve trained myself to consciously think before speaking: no more “thinking out loud” in front of my reports. You may need to reach into the depths of your willpower to stop yourself from blurting words that may get you in trouble, but trust me, it’s worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>

<p>“The ugly” parts are the frustrations of daily life. They’ll make you feel a bit “different” from others or “off”.  I’ve found they have little impact on my journey as a founder but instead can bring your enthusiasm and confidence down. Keeping them under control will improve your overall well being as a person which is very important for founders.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem of focus</strong>. This is the first thing people think about when they think ADHD, and with good reason. It’s difficult to describe to a non-ADHD person how quickly the ADHD brain gets distracted. For me, any notification will stop me from writing an important article or work on an important task. For founders, tasks calling for your attention and interruptions will grow exponentially with the size of the company. While disturbing to most people, it can be absolutely overwhelming for people with adult ADHD. Keep it simple: turn off all notifications or go back to pen and paper when deep focus is needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Time management</strong>. Being at a meeting on time, being ready for the meeting, planning in advance. These tasks are not easy for a person with ADHD. Before most deadlines, I seem to remember to do everything but the task I’m supposed to do. Time management is a crucial skill for founders and soon after you start your company your calendar will fill with dozens of meetings and other obligations per week. I’ve found it’s best to hire and rely early on somebody that can help you with organization. Alternatively, reminders, TODO lists, and other software can help you stay on top of tasks and meetings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>Finally with the “the good” parts. Let me preface this part by saying that the qualities listed below are not superpowers. But they may give you an edge in specific situations.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deep Focus</strong>. It appears to contradict the part above about the lack of focus, but people with ADHD <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus#ADHD">report having an ability to deeply focus on topics they are passionate about</a>. Currently, I’m reading everything I can get my hands on about the topic of documentation, in particular knowledge organization. I often lose track of time after sitting down with a compelling article and forget to eat a meal As founders start their journeys, they face incredible challenges: only the passion for their work will allow them to continue and overcome obstacles. Founders who are able to channel that “hyperfocus” towards the company’s future will leapfrog their competitors and be the engine that drives their company’s vision forward.</li>
  <li><strong>Creativity</strong>. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-creativity-of-adhd/">Research</a> points out that adults with ADHD show a higher level of creativity compared to other people. It’s been my observation that it has been easier for me to think “outside the box” when faced with a difficult problem than a lot of my peers. For founders, this is an advantage that they need to nurture in themselves, as success for a startup lies in doing things in a way that wasn’t thought possible before.</li>
  <li><strong>Impulsivity/Gut Feeling</strong>. The lack of filter which sometimes negatively impacts personal and professional relationships has a positive aspect as well. The life of a founder is punctuated by moments when it’s necessary to make an important decision with only partial information. It’s crucial to get over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">“analysis paralysis”</a> and trust your instinct. When hiring the first few people who will come to define your company, you’ll need to make a decision of who to bring on board. Trust your gut and go with the people that you think will make you successful.</li>
  <li><strong>Appetite for risk</strong>. Last but not least a rarely discussed aspect of adult ADHD is an above-average appetite for risk. This characteristic is of course essential to even start a business as a founder where nothing is for certain. As you grow, that “risk mindset” will be crucial to keep the company from playing it too safe after finding some initial success. For founders, pushing the boundaries is a requirement to survive as you grow.</li>
</ul>

<p>ADHD traits, described by the media, seem largely dysfunctional. While there’s some truth to it, they affect a founder’s life in contradictory ways: one day you’ll be extremely anxious and wondering why you took the leap in the first place, and the next you’ll be riding high, loving the risk of being an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>It’s too easy to let yourself be defined by the conditions you are born with and see them as roadblocks to your success. With most things in life you don’t get to choose what you’re born with, only what actions you take: if you want to become a founder, ADHD is just one of the problems you’ll need to solve along the way.</p>

September 5, 2020 | https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/under_construction/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/under_construction/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><a href="https://www.shirtpocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/under_construction/">Under Construction</a></em> Friday, September 04, 2020 </p></div><div>

<p>I haven't said anything about Big Sur yet, and since the public beta has  been out for a while, and I'm getting more questions about it, it's time.</p>

<p>At present, it's <strong>not possible</strong> to make bootable copies of Big Sur, even with <code>asr</code>, Apple's own built-in replication utility. As such, we haven't released a Beta, or even an internal Alpha, because it wouldn't meet our own requirements.</p>

<p>So, for the moment, we're holding back, hoping that Apple will fix the issues and allow 3rd party (or even 1st party, given <code>asr</code>) bootable backups. While <code>asr</code> was failing completely in previous builds, in the most recent one it isn't able to back up because the system volume isn't properly 'sealed' (which is ominous, since why wouldn't a standard install be sealed, and if it's not, why wouldn't you be able to back it up anyway).</p>

<p>So, while progress is being made, we're kind of stuck waiting for the king.</p>

<p>In the meantime, my advice for macOS Betas remains as valid as ever: <strong>do not install a macOS Beta</strong> unless you have a <strong>critical business need</strong> to do so. These Betas, even when public, are not for general use, and certainly not for anyone who wants a reliable system for day-to-day work.</p>

<p>If you <strong>must</strong> install it, use Time Machine for backups for now (and, given my advice in <a href="https://www.shirt-pocket.com/blog/index.php/shadedgrey/comments/practices_make_perfect_backups/">Practices Make Perfect (Backups)</a>, on a continuing basis in addition to other methods), since it's  at a relatively equivalent Beta quality level to the OS itself and is explicitly tested and supported by Apple.</p>

<p>I'll be back when we have additional news to share. For those in the US, enjoy Labor Day weekend!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been playing around a lot with concurrency in Go over the years, resulting in libraries such as <a href="https://scipipe.org/" target="_blank">SciPipe</a>, <a href="http://flowbase.org/" target="_blank">FlowBase</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rdfio/rdf2smw/" target="_blank">rdf2smw</a>. My main motivation for looking into Go has been the possibility to use it as a more performant, scaleable and type-safe alternative to Python for data heavy scripting tasks in bioinformatics and other fields I've been dabbling in. Especially as it makes it so easy to write concurrent and parallel code in it. Be warned that this context is surely giving me some biases.</p>

<p>I find the concurrency features of Go - with its lightweight goroutines and channels - to be hard to beat in that it also provides true parallelism by mapping the goroutines onto physical operating system threads automatically in the background. Few if any other mainstream languages does that. It lifts off a lot of concerns that you as a developer don't need to deal with.</p>

<p>Still, the Go syntax has always felt rather complex. After 5+ years, I have still not learned how to open up a file and reading from it line by line, and need to check up the syntax on a site like <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank">gobyexample.com</a>. This task also requires importing two different libraries (os, and bufio), which you have to remember.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://rillabs.com/site/assets/files/1111/selection_161.120x0-is.png" width="120">With this background, I found it interesting when a new language on the block, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2019/09/06/parallelism-in-crystal.html">touts to provide the same concurrency features</a>, still in a language with static typing and ahead-of-time compiling, with a much more scriptlike and clean syntax.</p>

<p>In this post, I take a brief look at Crystal by implementing a pattern I have been using a lot in Go: A simple pipeline, where one go-routine does something like read from a file, feeding of the data to another goroutine over a channel to do more work. I this post I will do this by implementing an extremely simple pipeline that does just that, in both of the languages, and then do some observations about the differences between the languages. In more concrete terms, what the program does is: let one go-routine read from a file line by line, and another one calculate the frequency of G and C:s over all of A, T, G, Cs in a DNA-file in the FASTA format.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-67/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa.gz">the (68MB) file I'm using here</a>.</p>

<p>You can find both of the below code files <a href="https://github.com/samuell/experiments/tree/master/govscr" target="_blank">on GitHub here</a>.</p>

<h3>Go implementation</h3>

<p>Here is the Go implementation:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	lineChan := make(chan string, 16)

	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Loop over the input file in a separate fiber
	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	go func() {
		defer close(lineChan)

		gcFile, err := os.Open("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")
		defer gcFile.Close()
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		scan := bufio.NewScanner(gcFile)
		for scan.Scan() {
			line := scan.Text()
			lineChan &lt;- line
		}
	}()

	at := 0
	gc := 0

	for line := range lineChan {
		if line[0] == '&gt;' {
			continue
		}

		for _, chr := range line {
			switch chr {
			case 'A', 'T':
				at += 1
				continue
			case 'G', 'C':
				gc += 1
				continue
			}
		}
	}

	var gcFrac float64
	gcFrac = float64(gc) / float64(at+gc)
	fmt.Printf("GC fraction: %f\n", gcFrac)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>GOMAXPROCS=4; go build -o gcgo gc.go
./gcgo</code></pre>

<h3>Crystal implementation</h3>

<p>... and here is the same functionality, implemented in Crystal:</p>

<pre><code>lines_chan = Channel(String).new(16)

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the input file in a separate fiber (and thread, if you set the
# CRYSTAL_WORKERS count to something larger than 1), and send its output on a
# channel
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
spawn do
  gcfile = File.new("Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.67.dna_rm.chromosome.Y.fa")                                      
  gcfile.each_line() do |line|                                                                            
    lines_chan.send(line)                                                                                 
  end                                                                                                     
  gcfile.close 
ensure  
  lines_chan.close
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loop over the lines on the channel in the main thread, and count GC fraction.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at = 0
gc = 0
while line = lines_chan.receive?
  if line.starts_with?('&gt;')
    next
  end
  line.each_byte() do |chr|
    case chr
    when 'A', 'T'
      at += 1
      next
    when 'G', 'C'
      gc += 1
      next
    end
  end
end

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Output results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gcfrac = gc / (gc + at)
puts "GC fraction: #{gcfrac}"
</code></pre>



<p>Note that to run the Crystal program with true multi-threading, you have to send a flag: -Dpreview_mt, to use it.</p>

<p>Compile and run with e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>CRYSTAL_WORKERS=4; crystal build --release -Dpreview_mt -o gccr gc.cr
./gccr

</code></pre>

<h3>Some differences</h3>

<p>We can note a few differences:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Crystal code is considerably shorter.</li>
	<li>I find the Crystal code easier to read.</li>
	<li>Crystal does not need to create a main()-function, but can include code directly in the file, similar to Python and Ruby.</li>
	<li>In Crystal you don't need to import multiple packages to open a file, and to loop over it.</li>
	<li>In Crystal, as seen in the code, we use "<a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/syntax_and_semantics/exception_handling.html#ensure" target="_blank">ensure</a>", between any two "begin/end" clauses, in a similar way as Go:s "defer", to ensure something is done as the very last thing before existing the function.</li>
	<li>In my tests, the Go implementation has always outperformed the Crystal one, so far. This might change with time of course.</li>
	<li>Truly static binary deployments seem to not be fully supported in Crystal just yet (see <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">Issue #9285</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think it is a bit early to draw to hard conclusions between the two langauges, as Crystal is so new, and this is just a very first test by me. But I find it interesting to have two languages with a similar set of concurrency primitives, to be able to compare various factors, as well as approaches taken.</p>

<p>Crystal looks like a promising alternative to Go, for concurrency use cases which allows writing in a much more script-like syntax. This could potentially make it a really interesting language for scientific fields such as bioinformatics, something that bioinformatics luminary <a href="https://twitter.com/lh3lh3" target="_blank">Heng Li</a> <a href="https://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languages" target="_blank">has been blogging about</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/9285" target="_blank">pointed out a problematic area for deployment</a>, currently).</p>

<p>I'm still worried about whether Crystal will manage to provide the same level of extremely portable, statically linked binaries though (EDIT: <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/2020/02/02/alpine-based-docker-images.html" target="_blank">there's a workaround, using alpine linux</a>), and this might turn out to be a real dealbreaker. Also, with the upcoming generics implementation in Go, some of the complexities of Go might be possible to hide away for end-users of some libraries, by providing high-level abstractions over typical complex tasks. One can of course also wonder if Crystal will be able to reach the level of popularity and size of ecosystem as Go, without a large industry backer (maybe if they can leverage the large number of Ruby-developers looking for a new compiled, fast language?).</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what happens, as Crystal gets closer to 1.0, and Go soon gets generics into the language. What can be said for sure, is that we will soon have more options, for writing concurrent, performant code.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

      <p>Long-time readers will know that I’m <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/05/18/rss-nothing-better/">a big fan of RSS feeds</a>. An RSS reader has been essential to my web experience since I first came online, and I’ve doggedly stuck to using them even as the web has centralised onto a few platforms and much digital ink spilt about the “death of RSS”. Luckily, I’m not the only one who prefers this old-school, human-curated approach to the web over today’s platforms and their algorithms.</p>
<p><a href="https://fraidyc.at/">Fraidycat</a> is a browser extension for following people on the web, created by someone named Kicks Condor, whose <a href="https://www.kickscondor.com/">main internet presence</a> as of this writing appears to an elaborate act of performance art. Previously it was a blog, and maybe it will be one again, who can say?</p>
<p>Like a latter day <a href="https://davidyat.es/2017/09/23/review-whys-poignant-guide-to-ruby/">_why</a>, Kicks combines clever programming with a colourful and quirky aesthetic to create software that is both useful and a little odd, hence the name and colourscheme.</p>

<p>Fraidycat differs from traditional RSS readers (ala the late Google Reader) in two key ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. It’s not just an RSS reader</strong>. In addition to RSS (and Atom, and JSON) feeds, you can use Fraidycat to follow Twitter and Instagram accounts, Youtube channels, TiddlyWikis, <a href="https://davidyat.es/2019/06/24/indieweb/">indieweb</a> h-feeds and <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat#follow-support">a whole bunch more</a>. The explicit goal of the project is provide a universal interface for following people regardless of the platforms they use.</p>
<p>Although I don’t share the author’s complete aversion to using social media sites, I find Fraidycat very useful for following a few high signal-to-noise accounts on various platforms, so I can make sure I see everything they post.</p>
<p><strong>2. It doesn’t look like an email client.</strong> Most feed readers carefully track and even save each post from each of your subscriptions. Posts are marked as read or unread, and, where possible, the full body text of each post is embedded in the reader’s interface. Fraidycat doesn’t even try to do either of these things. No distinction is made between read and unread items (beyond your browser’s visited/unvisited link colouration), and no tally is kept. No interface exists for reading post content. Every site/account you subscribe to is shown with links to its five most recent posts. Clicking a link takes you to the post in question, and if you want to see the sixth most recent post, well, you can go to the site itself.</p>
<p>These feature omissions are my favourite things about Fraidycat. I follow a lot of different sites for a lot of different reasons. With some, I want to read every post. With others, I just want to see the latest headlines and dip into when one catches my eye. Every RSS reader I’ve used in the past has irritated me by running up unread counts for the latter category.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my post about <a href="https://davidyat.es/2020/03/14/reader-modes/">browser reader modes</a>, I usually prefer to read articles on their original websites – partly so that they don’t all blend together like Medium sludge, and partly because syndicated content has an uncomfortably high probability of losing formatting and even chunks of text. So Fraidycat’s philosophy of linking rather than rendering is ideal for my usecase. The world could probably do with more developers who <a href="https://github.com/kickscondor/fraidycat/wiki/Rejected-Features">intentionally leave out features</a>.</p>
<p>Fraidycat allows you to categorise your subscriptions on two levels: category and importance. Categories are up to you to define, and are shown as tabs at the top of the page. One subscription can appear in multiple categories. Kicks’s preferred aesthetic is to use emojis as category names, but you can use words too.</p>
<p>Importance is unique to Fraidycat, and provides a way for you to prioritise content and shape your reading habits. Each subscription can appear in one of the below importances:</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This allows you to determine how often you’ll want to check in on a given site/account/person, which is likely to be a function of how frequently they post, the lengths of their posts, and how interested you are in their content. A favourite Twitter account, for example, may be placed in Real-time, while a rarely updated blog, or one you seldom have time to read, may be placed in Sometimes, to be glanced at when you’re not doing anything else.</p>
<p>I wasn’t completely sold on this feature when I first started using Fraidycat, as I’d often forget to check the last two tabs, but that’s basically the point of having them – not everything needs to be checked for updates all the time. In any case, you can just put everything in Real-time or Frequent and never bother with time sensitivity if it doesn’t work for you.</p>
<p>Before switching to Fraidycat about a year ago, I used web-based RSS readers like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>. My main concern with switching was that my subscriptions would be tied to my main PC. Fortunately, the extension integrates with browser sync, so subscriptions will be synced between devices. This functionality didn’t exist the last time I tried using a browser extension feed reader, and its absence would have been a dealbreaker (and also a heartbreaker).</p>
<p>There’s currently no way to get Fraidycat on a smartphone, but I don’t need it there. Even the feeds I follow in real-time aren’t quite important enough that I need to check them when I’m not in front of a computer. Which, I think, is very much in keeping with the application’s philosophy. Fraidycat produces no notifications, applies no machine learning to your subscriptions to recommend content you might like, and doesn’t gamify your actions or track you. You choose who to follow and how to follow, and the app does nothing outside of that. Fraidycat is the best RSS reader I’ve ever used because of what it leaves out.</p>

<p>Permutation City is a great novel with a very interesting philosophical argument embedded inside it. Many people don’t want to read the whole novel, so here is my short explanation of Egan’s Dust Theory.</p>



<p>If you think experience is simulatable, you buy computational or “patternist” theories of identity, there are some very strange implications that are not commonly brought up. </p>



<p>Because computation is sort of subjective, just a set of relations that can be usefully interpreted as representing a function, this seems to imply that the function you identify with can be interpreted as being simulated by any sufficiently complex set of relations. </p>



<p>That is, for any random set of relations with enough complexity to represent a human mind, Egan claims, there exists an exotic encoding scheme that can interpret this set of relations as representing any arbitrary function, including the function that you would call “I”.</p>



<p>Now you cannot access this information usefully, so most functions can be said to not usefully exist within this randomness. But if you buy the whole “I think therefore I am” business this does not matter for those functions that are conscious, because consciousness is self-justifying. </p>



<p>So the function that is you is being “run” far more often in random noise than engineered computers or ‘real’ physical reality. This is sort of like the Boltzmann brain idea but even worse because it applies to any set of relations. According to Egan’s argument all possible experiences that can be computed by any sufficiently complex set of relations are in fact computed by them. </p>



<p>In fact, even if you imagine a static set of relations that do not evolve in time there still exists encoding schemes that can interpret this set of relations as any arbitrary function, so in some sense the set of mathematical objects that represent “you” and “me” and all possible minds can be said to exist in these timeless relations. </p>



<p>Egan discusses some counterarguments to the idea here: <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html">https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html</a></p>

September 5, 2020 | https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>



<pre>MOV rm&lt;-&gt;r     4  3
LEA            1  1
alu rm&lt;-&gt;r    32  4
alu rm,i       4  5

RET/RETF iw    4  4
JMP cw/JMP cb  2  6
JMP cd         1  7
Jcond         32  3
MOV rmw&lt;-&gt;sr   2  2
LES            1  4

SAHF           1  4
LAHF           1  2
ESC            8  1
XLAT           1  5
STOS           2  6 (discontinuous)
CMPS/SCAS      4 13 (discontinuous)
MOVS/LODS      4 11 (discontinuous)
JCXZ           1  5 (discontinuous)
LOOPNE/LOOPE   2  5
LOOP           1  4
DAA/DAS        2  4
AAA/AAS        2  8
AAD            1  4
AAM            1  6
INC/DEC rw    16  2
INT ib         1  2
INTO           1  4
INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>The article has been updated to accommodate changes since the original four months ago.</p></blockquote>



<p>Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release, 20.04, and installed it on day one. A month in, I’m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready <em>snap</em> features being effectively forced onto Ubuntu is affecting my usability and user-friendliness.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="409" height="230" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=409 409w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=300 300w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Software center can’t install Flatpak apps</strong></h2>



<p>In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu’s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a <em>snap</em> app. The new snapped store can handle management of <em>snap</em> applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can’t install or remove Flatpak applications, like the .deb version could.</p>



<p>Users wanting to install Flatpak apps <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/25/how-to-install-flatpak-apps-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/">need to revert to using the .deb version</a>. It’s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.</p>



<h2><strong>Browsing the Snap Store sucks</strong></h2>



<p>Good apps, and finding them, are central to the success of any modern operating system. Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snapped store to at least do what it’s supposed to do well–help find apps. It turns out that instead Ubuntu prioritizes snap apps over .deb ones in store search results at any cost! So you’ll see a long list of non relevant entries of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-</p>



<p>Needless to say this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for users switching from Windows or Mac. The snapped store isn’t just a step back, but is downright unreliable.</p>



<h2><strong>Slow and forced Chromium snap</strong></h2>



<p>On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or the command line, it acts as an alias and installs the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu; Just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn’t justify this forced behavior.</p>



<p>Besides, a typical user doesn’t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works. And that’s another place where snaps don’t shine. They are slow. I hate that Chromium’s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default <em>anything</em> yet.</p>



<h2><strong>No control over updates</strong></h2>



<p>Snap applications auto-update and that’s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can’t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update after a threshold time. This is unacceptable. Even Apple has easy options to disable automatic software updates.</p>



<p>Ubuntu’s update process with 20.04 LTS is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they’re updating and when they’d like to. Even at best, this behavior is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/25?u=uncertainquark">discussion on the Ubuntu forums</a> on the topic and many such raised issues by others didn’t go well, read the <em>full thread</em> if interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user’s will.</p>



<p>What’s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don’t hate snaps but being forced to use it especially when in a clearly premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren’t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should’ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should’ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora’s <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/">Silverblue</a>, and only swap the default when it’s ready.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it. I have switched to macOS as my daily driver, for many other reasons. I don’t have the time to keep fixing things on Linux Desktop and be constantly finding ways to work around standard OS features that should otherwise just be available and work.</p>



<p>For those on Linux, I recommend using <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS 20.04</a> instead of Ubuntu as it is basically Ubuntu but without the snap, and some unique features. <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> is what I use on my now secondary device, mainly because of its <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/">app ecosystem</a>, <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/03/21/why-i-love-elementary-os-file-manager/">excellent file manager</a> and the <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/04/my-contributions-to-elementary-os-and-how-you-can-too/">welcoming nature</a> of their developers for contributions and suggestions.</p>

<em>Inflammatory proteins, also known as cytokines, play a crucial role in the immune response. If this immune response is too strong, a phenomenon known as “cytokine storm”, it can cause harm to the patient. It has been thought that a cytokine storm contributes to disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Following the measurement of several important cytokines in patients with COVID-19 and various other severe diseases, researchers at Radboud university medical center now show that COVID-19 is <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770484" target="_blank">not characterized by a cytokine storm</a>. This may have consequences for the treatment of these patients, the researchers write in JAMA.</em><p>
&nbsp;
The cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is not clearly defined. In many cases, different cytokines are evaluated and no comparison has been made with other diseases. Therefore, uncertainty and doubt exists concerning the cytokine storm in these patients.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Various patient groups</strong><br>
Researchers from the Intensive Care (IC) department at Radboud university medical center have now measured the concentration of three essential cytokines in the blood of patients admitted to the IC with several distinct conditions. They performed these measurements in patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria for a severe acute respiratory infection (ARDS), patients with bacterial septic shock (with and without ARDS), and patients who had been admitted to the IC after a cardiac arrest or severe trauma. The cytokines were measured using the same methods for each of the groups of patients.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Cytokine storm?</strong><br>
In the abovedescribed five patient groups, the concentration of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)&nbsp;and interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8) was measured. The results were remarkable. Researcher Matthijs Kox: "The level of cytokines was significantly less elevated in COVID-19 patients than in patients with septic shock and ARDS. Compared to patients with septic shock without ARDS, so without severe pulmonary disease, patients with COVID-19 also displayed markedly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-8. The cytokine concentrations in COVID-19 patients were similar to those in IC &nbsp;patients with trauma or cardiac arrest, conditions that are not noted for a cytokine storm."</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>Possible consequences</strong><br>
The results from this study show that COVID-19 is not characterized by a cytokine storm. Professor of Intensive Care Medicine Peter Pickkers: "The severe disease observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients is therefore not explained by strongly elevated levels of inflammatory proteins in the blood. This means that critically ill COVID-19 patients likely will not benefit from specific anti-cytokine therapies."<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The programming world is moving towards functional programming (FP). More developers are using languages with an explicit bias towards FP, such as Scala and Haskell, while object-oriented (OO) languages and their communities adopt FP features and practices. (A striking example of the latter is the rise of Typescript and React in the Javascript community.) So what is FP and what does it mean to write code in a functional style? It’s common to view functional programming as a collection of language features, such as first class functions, or to define it as a programming style using immutable data and pure functions. (Pure functions always return the same output given the same input.) This was my view when I started down the FP route, but I now believe the true goals of FP are enabling local reasoning and composition. Language features and programming style are in service of these goals. In this post I attempt to explain the meaning and value of local reasoning and composition.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-is">What Functional Programming Is</h2>
<p>I believe that functional programming is a hypothesis about software quality: that software that can be understood before it is run and is built of small reusable components is easier to write and maintain. The first property is known as local reasoning, and the second as composition. Let’s address each in turn.</p>
<p>Local reasoning means we can understand pieces of code in isolation. When we see the expression <code>1 + 1</code> we know what it means regardless of the weather, the database, or the current status of our Kubernetes cluster. None of these external events can change it. This is a trivial and slightly silly example, but it illustrates a point. A goal of functional programming is to extend this ability across our code base.</p>
<p>It can help to understand local reasoning by looking at what it is not. Shared mutable state is out because relying on shared state means that other code can change what our code does without our knowledge. It means no global mutable configuration, as found in many web frameworks and graphics libraries for example, as any random code can change that configuration. Metaprogramming has to be carefully controlled. No <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a>, for example, as again it allows other code to change our code in non-obvious ways. As we can see, adapting code to enable local reasoning can mean quite some sweeping changes. However if we work in a language that embraces functional programming this style of programming is the default.</p>
<p>Composition means building big things out of smaller things. Numbers are compositional. We can take any number and add one, giving us a new number. Lego is also compositional. We compose Lego by sticking it together. In the particular sense we’re using composition we also require the original elements we combine don’t change in any way when they are composed. When we create by <code>2</code> by adding <code>1</code> and <code>1</code> we get a new result but we don’t change what <code>1</code> means.</p>
<p>We can find compositional ways to model common programming tasks once we start looking for them. React components are one example familiar to many front-end developers: a component can consist of many components. HTTP routes can be modelled in a compositional way. A route is a function from an HTTP request to a handler function or a value indicating the route did not match. We can combine routes as a logical or: try this route or, if it doesn’t match, try this other route. Processing pipelines are another example that often use sequential composition: perform this pipeline stage and then this other pipeline stage.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>Types are not strictly part of functional programming but statically typed FP is the most popular form of FP and sufficiently important to warrant a mention. Types help compilers generate efficient code but types in FP are as much for the programmer as they are the compiler. Types express properties of programs, and the type checker automatically ensures that these properties hold. They can tell us, for example, what a function accepts and what it returns, or that a value is optional. We can also use types to express our beliefs about a program and the type checker will tell us if those beliefs are incorrect. For example, we can use types to tell the compiler we do not expect an error at a particular point in our code and the type checker will let us know if have made an incorrect assumption. In this way types are another tool for reasoning about code.</p>
<p>Type systems push programs towards particular designs, as to work effectively with the type checker requires designing code in a way the type checker can understand. As modern type systems come to other languages they naturally tend to shift programmers in those languages towards a FP style of coding.</p>
<h2 id="what-functional-programming-isn%E2%80%99t">What Functional Programming Isn’t</h2>
<p>In my view functional programming is not about immutability, or keeping to “the substitution model of evaluation”, and so on. These are tools in service of the goals of enabling local reasoning and composition, but they are not the goals themselves. Code that is immutable always allows local reasoning, for example, but it is not necessary to avoid mutation to still have local reasoning. Here is an example of summing a collection of numbers. First we have the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>numbers<span>:</span> Array<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span></span><span>)</span><span>:</span> number <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    numbers<span>.</span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> total<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same function in Scala:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> sum<span>(</span>numbers<span>:</span> List<span>[</span><span>Int</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>var</span> total <span>=</span> <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>  numbers<span>.</span>foreach<span>(</span>x <span>=&gt;</span> total <span>=</span> total <span>+</span> x<span>)</span></span><br><span>  total</span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In both implementations we mutate <code>total</code>. This is ok though! We cannot tell from the outside that this is done, and therefore all users of <code>sum</code> can still use local reasoning. Inside <code>sum</code> we have to be careful when we reason about <code>total</code> but this block of code is small enough that it shouldn’t cause any problems.</p>
<p>In this case we can reason about our code despite the mutation, but neither the Typescript nor the Scala compiler can determine that this is ok. Both languages allow mutation but it’s up to us to use it appropriately. A more expressive type system, perhaps with features like Rust’s, would be able to tell that <code>sum</code> doesn’t allow mutation to be observed by other parts of the system<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Another approach, which is the one taken by Haskell, is to disallow all mutation and thus guarantee it cannot cause problems.</p>
<p>Mutation also interferes with composition. For example, if a value relies on internal state then composing it may produce unexpected results. Consider generators in Javascript. They maintain internal state that is used to generate the next value. If we have two generators we might want to combine them into one generator that yields values from the two inputs. Here’s the code in Typescript:</p>
<pre><code><span>type Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> Generator<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> <span>void</span><span>,</span> never<span>&gt;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>number<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>let</span> index <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>yield</span> index<span>++</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>function</span> zip<span>&lt;</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>left<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>a<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> right<span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span>b<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Gen<span>&lt;</span><span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    <span>function</span><span>*</span> <span>zipIt</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> l <span>=</span> left<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>const</span> r <span>=</span> right<span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>l<span>.</span>done <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>r<span>.</span>done<span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>            <span>const</span> result<span>:</span> <span>[</span>a<span>,</span> b<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>l<span>.</span>value<span>,</span> r<span>.</span>value<span>]</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>            <span>yield</span> result<span>;</span></span><br><span>        <span>}</span></span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> <span>zipIt</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This works if we pass two distinct generators to <code>zip</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span><span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>However if we pass the same generator twice we get a surprising result.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> inf <span>=</span> <span>infinite</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>zip</span><span>(</span>inf<span>,</span> inf<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>next</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>value<span>;</span> </span></code></pre>
<p>The usual functional programming solution is to avoid mutable state but we can envisage other possibilities. For example, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system">effect tracking system</a> would allow us to avoid combining two generators that use the same memory region. These systems are still research projects, however.</p>
<p>So in my opinion immutability (and purity, referential transparency, and no doubt more fancy words that I have forgotten) have become associated with functional programming because they guarantee local reasoning and composition, and until recently we didn’t have the language tools to automatically distinguish safe uses of mutation from those that cause problems. Restricting ourselves to immutability is the easiest way to ensure the desirable properties of functional programming, but as languages evolve this might come to be regarded as a historical artifact.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>I have described local reasoning and composition but have not discussed their benefits. Why are they are desirable? The answer is that they make efficient use of knowledge. Let me expand on this.</p>
<p>We care about local reasoning because it allows our ability to understand code to scale with the size of the code base. We can understand module A and module B in isolation, and our understanding does not change when we bring them together in the same program. By definition if both A and B allow local reasoning there is no way that B (or any other code) can change our understanding of A, and vice versa. If we don’t have local reasoning every new line of code can force us to revisit the rest of the code base to understand what has changed. This means it becomes exponentially harder to understand code as it grows in size as the number of interactions (and hence possible behaviours) grows exponentially. We can say that local reasoning is compositional. Our understanding of module A calling module B is just our understanding of A, our understanding of B, and whatever calls A makes to B.</p>
<p>We introduced numbers and Lego as examples of composition. They have an interesting property in common: the operations that we can use to combine them (for example, addition, subtraction, and so on for numbers; for Lego the operation is “sticking bricks together”) give us back the same kind of thing. A number multiplied by a number is a number. Two bits of Lego stuck together is still Lego. This property is called closure: when you combine things you end up with the same kind of thing. Closure means you can apply the combining operations (sometimes called combinators) an arbitrary number of times. No matter how many times you add one to a number you still …</p></div></div>

          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.

          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

        <p>
          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.

        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <h2>Offline and local-first</h2>
        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>

<h2 itemprop="headline">Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks in 2020</h2>

<div itemprop="description">
<p>Unique web app features become possible when developed as part of a robust framework. Software engineers choose the libraries and tools that best suit the final goal, and everything necessary to achieve it. Web solutions traditionally involve a custom approach, and consequently – a custom network. Since JavaScript frameworks are notoriously useful for building websites, web creators prefer them. But what framework is best for what project? Here’s what we found out. </p>
<div><p>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted, lightweight, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language, which utilizes first-class functions. JavaScript can undoubtedly be called the most popular programming language when it comes to building web pages and web applications. Not only that, but non-browser environments have widely used it. Some of the famous examples include Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, dynamic language, which happens to be multi-paradigm and single-threaded. It supports imperative, object-oriented, and declarative styles.</p><p>
In terms of demand, JavaScript can be put right after Python, which remains the most used programming language overall. In this article, we are going to talk about the Top 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks that are in demand in 2020. So, if you are a beginner looking to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, or a professional looking to update your knowledge about the latest JavaScript frameworks, you are in luck.</p><p>The criteria that we are going to use to stack up these 10 most popular JavaScript frameworks include:</p></div><ul><li>Popularity (based on reliable sites like Google Trends, NPM Trends and GitHub)</li>
<li>Establishment (this factor includes how mainstream or established a framework is in the programming community or industry)</li>
<li>Support (based on how much community support a particular framework has)</li>
<li>Future Prospects (this one includes the strength of the framework going towards the future, i.e., it is not fading away in the future).</li></ul><p>The top 10 JavaScript frameworks according to our above-discussed criteria are as following:</p>
<h2>React</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-react.jpg" alt="React JS"></p>
<div><p>While React might not be the earliest JavaScript framework in the industry of JS-based web frameworks, it is, for sure, the most powerful and disruptive framework at the moment. React was created by Jordan Walke and a group of Facebook engineers. React is a component-based framework with only one-way data flow, and react single-handedly changed the way front-end web development is done.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It happens to be one of the most unbiased and neutral frameworks in which React-Core is just a component-based library for the View layer.</li>
<li>React also happens to be very versatile, which shows in their slogan ‘Learn Once, Write Anywhere,’ meaning that developers who have once learned React can then go on to create anything from websites, mobile apps, desktop applications, and back-end development.</li>
<li>It has recently introduced new features like React-Fiber for better concurrency, React hook for less boilerplate code, and suspense for better rendering.</li>
<li>React framework offers the best server-side rendering (SSR) along with excellent search engine optimization (SEO) support.</li>
<li>Finally, having the backing of Facebook, React framework is continuously under development and only keeps improving, thanks to the rigorous battle testing by 2.6 billion users of Facebook.</li></ol>
<h2>Node.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-node.jpg" alt="Node JS"></p>
<div><p>From the day JavaScript was created, there have been several attempts to use JS in server-side development. Still, none of them was very successful until 2009, when Ryan Dahl, created an asynchronous and event-driven server-side JavaScript runtime framework called Node.js.</p><p>
This brought JavaScript into the territory of server-side development, and from that day onwards, JavaScript and Node.js shot up in popularity. With many frameworks and libraries, including node package manager (NPM), node.js has left behind many more developed frameworks owing to its asynchronous and event-driven nature. Node.js is lightweight with a fast runtime, making it one of the best.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>As discussed earlier, its main feature is being an asynchronous and event-driven framework and can build scalable network applications.</li>
<li>Like react, Node.js is also cross-platform, and once you have mastered it, you can work on pretty much anything, including windows, macOS, iOS, Linux and Android, etc.</li>
<li>Because of its smaller size and a relatively faster startup, node.js is favorable in serverless computing.</li>
<li>Node.js is an open-source framework run by OpenJS Foundation and supported by tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, and Netflix, which makes its development and new advancements very easy.</li></ol>
<h2>Angular</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-angular.jpg" alt="Angular JS"></p>
<div><p>AngularJS was created by Google, as one of the earliest JavaScript frameworks, but the advent of frameworks like React exposed the design flaws that existed in AnuglarJS. It was in 2016 that the google team stroke back with an all-new SPA framework and called it Angular. While it might sound similar to the last one, these two are very different frameworks. Angular is slowly catching up to all the hype that frameworks like react and node.js enjoy, and it won’t be long before it might surpass them.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>It is an end-to-end framework with “out of the box” support to develop Enterprise Application. The Angular CLI happens to have one of the best command-line tools in all of JavaScript.</li>
<li>Angular is uniquely suited to enterprise-grade large codebase due to the separation of the template from styling and business logic.</li>
<li>Built-in features like DOM sanitization make Angular the most secure front-end framework.</li>
<li>While Google may not be backing Angular as some other tech giants back their frameworks, it does, however, release new features every now and then.</li>
<li>Angular 9 has introduced a new rendering engine called Ivy, which reduces startup time, response time, and bundle size.</li></ol>
<h2>Vue.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-vue-2.jpg" alt="Vue JS"></p>
<div><p>There was one thing that was common amongst all three of the frameworks we discussed before, and it was that they are all being backed by some huge tech giant, which ensures their continuous development and keeping them up to date. Vue.js, on the other hand, was created by an ex-Google engineer Evan You. You made the Vue.js by bringing together all the best parts of different JS frameworks that include view layer from AngularJS and virtual DOM from React. It is now considered one of the easiest frameworks that developers can use to work on front-end development and write SPA applications with minor effort.</p><p>
Vue.JS can work as an end-to-end framework with routing having the capabilities of both, i.e., state management like Angular or a view layer like React.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Vue.js offers the best in class documentation and progressive app development. It helps you progressively modernize your codebase, especially if you have a large legacy JavaScript codebase.</li>
<li>Vue.js is one of the few frameworks with equal support for both JavaScript and TypeScript.</li>
<li>It offers reactive two-way data binding (like Angular) and Virtual DOM, Event Sourcing (like React). It comes with two other features, including an opinionated end-to-end framework and a view layer with state management.</li>
<li>It is currently going under an overhaul and will return stronger than ever with Vue.js 3.0.</li></ol>
<h2>Next.js</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-next.jpg" alt="Next JS"></p>
<div><p>As we have established before that React is a very unopinionated framework where React-Core only offers the view layer. This left room for a framework that is based on React but is an end-to-end opinionated framework. That is where Next.js comes in, created by Tim Neutkens and a group of other engineers from a Dutch company called Zeit. Next.js is an end-to-end higher-level web framework on top of React and Node.js. It offers both static websites for desktop, mobile devices, and web as well as server-rendered.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Next.js was built with two of the most powerful JavaScript frameworks that are React and Node.js</li>
<li>Like many others before it, you only need to learn Next.js once, and then you can utilize its versatility to develop for pretty much any platform you want.</li>
<li>It offers server-side rendering with exceptional search engine optimization support and a quick startup.</li>
<li>Next.js supports data fetching and built-in CSS support that is easy-to-use.</li></ol>
<h2>Express</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-express.jpg" alt="Express JS"></p>
<div><p>Express.js is perhaps the only JavaScript framework with minimalistic web framework Sinatra in mind. It was created by TJ Holowaychuk and appeared shortly after Node.js came to be. It is a minimalistic web framework to develop REST API and web application, which makes it extremely fast and less opinionated. Many other JavaScript frameworks have used express as a base.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Express.js is so minimalistic that it could be considered default JavaScript Server Side Framework.</li>
<li>It is a complete application framework with everything from middleware to routing and template.</li>
<li>Express.js offers robust routing.</li>
<li>It also supports content negotiation.</li></ol>
<h2>Meteor</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor JS"></p>
<div><p>Meteor happens to be the first isomorphic, and open-source full-stack JavaScript framework creating by a group of engineers in 2012. Meteor is wholly based on node.js and supports building end-to-end applications for all major platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile. Meteor also integrates well with front-end development frameworks like react etc.</p><p>
<b>Features</b></p></div><ol><li>Meteor offers full-stack framework for application development starting from the back-end and finishing till the front-end.</li>
<li>While it does have its engine for front end development, most developers integrate meteor with other popular-front end development platforms like Angular, React, or Svelte.</li>
<li>Like many other cross-platform frameworks, meteor also allows web development across all platforms, including web, desktop, and mobile.</li></ol>
<h2>Svelte</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/js-svelte-2.jpg" alt="Svelte JS"></p>
<div><p>Svelte was a groundbreaking idea ever since its inception, developed by a Guardian software engineer named Rich Harris. Svelte is a JavaScript framework with no framework-specific runtime. The main idea behind this creation was to use the svelte compiler, which would help compile the code that was framework …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Everybody claims to be a software company these days. From the nearly decade old pronouncement by Marc Andressen that <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">“Software Is Eating the World”</a> to the push from Wall Street to produce recurring software revenue; the pressure is on to claim - at least - that you are a software company. <br></p><p>This is obviously problematic for appliance vendors. Try as they might, it does not take much inspection to determine which ones have become truly software defined, and which ones are hoping to use financial engineering to fake it until they get there. <br></p><p>Either way, the ongoing debate about which is better, software defined storage or hardware storage appliances. Is pretty much over. <br></p><p>Like Marc predicted, software won. <br></p><p>We need to start with a clear definition of software defined storage. First of all, it is software. It most likely started as software too - it wasn’t “extracted” from a proprietary hardware platform. <br></p><p>Software defined storage should run on multiple customer servers with direct access storage (DAS) SSDs or disk drives or JBoDs (just a bunch of disks) or JBoF (just a bunch of flash) shelves that are SAS/NVMe attached to the servers. <br></p><p>True software defined storage doesn’t run on a narrow list of pre-approved boxes - that is just hardware defined storage with choices. Software defined storage should run on almost anything. For example a <a href="https://github.com/christianbaun/ossperf/wiki/Minio-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-3-with-Raspbian-(Debian-Jessie-8.0)">Raspberry Pi</a>. Or <a href="https://min.io/resources/docs/MinIO-POWER-whitepaper-HR.pdf">IBM Power9 infrastructure</a>. Or anything <a href="https://min.io/product/reference-hardware">in-between</a>.<br></p><p>Hardware defined storage (appliances) combine server and storage hardware and software into one packaged solution that a customer buys whole from that vendor. Hardware defined storage is normally deployed by vendor personnel and can take the form of rackable hardware with vendor covers but underneath, is typically two or more servers with SAS or NVMe storage shelves attached. Hardware defined storage vendors provide the internal networking to connect the multiple servers and storage together. The appliance vendor personnel are responsible for servicing the appliance server and storage hardware as well as the storage software. <br></p><p>Let’s break it down further shall we?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Software Defined</th>
<th>Hardware Defined/Appliance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Cost</td>
<td>Superior. The customer supplies <br>their own servers &amp; storage <br>designed for the price/performance <br>configuration the deployment <br>calls for.</td>
<td>Worse. The storage vendor supplies <br>all of the hardware,<br>software and service for <br>the solution. Difficult to unbundle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Dependent on what is provisioned. <br>True high performance SDS on <br>fast HW and a fast network <br>outperforms even the “fast” <br>appliance vendors. This trend<br>will only continue. To be sure, <br>there will be niche cases <br>- but fast software is the <br>starting point.</td>
<td>Vendors optimize hardware and <br>software to get the most <br>performance and availability <br>out of the system. Price/Performance <br>curves are pretty linear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scalability</td>
<td>Better, as these are deployed <br>as a storage cluster, they <br>can often range from 3-4 nodes<br>to 100s of nodes and anything<br>in between.</td>
<td>Worse. Appliances typically come <br>with dual (server) controllers<br>and can typically scale up<br>to 4 of these (8 servers) <br>but generally not much higher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fault <br>tolerance</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>treats failure as a normal event. <br>Done well, clusters seamlessly <br>redirect, heal or recover. <br>Sophisticated erasure-coding <br>and bitrot protection are software<br>inventions - and ensure manageability is <br>prioritized.</td>
<td>Appliances are generally optimized<br>for providing high levels of<br>fault tolerance. They are <br>typically deployed with dual <br>controllers that quickly failover <br>when one dies and provide <br>sophisticated storage protection <br>policies. Replacing the appliance <br>is not the same, however, as <br>replacing COTS hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Automation</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API driven. These APIs typically <br>support most DevOps and <br>infrastructure automation and <br>monitoring packages currently <br>deployed in a data center.</td>
<td>Appliances generally support a <br>GUI first and APIs as second-class<br>citizens, if at all. This limits <br>automation and application failure <br>management. It is why most appliances<br>are only used for archival and not <br>modern apps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration <br>flexibility</td>
<td>Customers deploy these solutions <br>on whatever performance and <br>capacity they want (within HCLs). <br>The configuration flexibility is <br>nearly infinite - critical when <br>considering the modern range <br>(data center to edge).</td>
<td>Appliances typically limit options <br>to very specific offerings, <br>generally 3-5 models are available <br>with DRAM &amp; capacity limits for <br>each model. Performance is often <br>limited by the appliance model <br>selected. Mixing and matching <br>models is a no-no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trialability</td>
<td>Want to try out software <br>defined storage - download it <br>and get started. If your <br>provider is truly open source<br>- what you are playing with <br>is the same software their <br>best customers run.</td>
<td>Appliances must be made available <br>to the customer on their data <br>center premises or at some other <br>test facility to be tried out. <br>Massive friction in the sales process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upgradeability</td>
<td>Customers can switch out <br>current servers or storage <br>with better ones anytime <br>they want and do <br>this themselves.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors generally <br>offer only specific model <br>upgrades to appliances which <br>have to be purchased and <br>are typically done by vendor <br>personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of installation</td>
<td>Better. As customers add <br>server or storage hardware <br>and deploy software on servers <br>all the time, they <br>can deploy software defined <br>storage on current or new servers <br>anytime they want.</td>
<td>Appliance vendors personnel are <br>typically used to deploy the <br>appliances. This may require <br>cross scheduling of data center <br>and vendor service personnel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ease <br>of operations</td>
<td>Software defined storage is <br>API first, but also supports <br>GUIs and/or are integrated <br>into larger solution interfaces <br>(think MinIO + Cisco).</td>
<td>Application vendors have invested <br>heavily in their GUI’s and <br>they are typically fully featured. <br>A good GUI can be a powerful form<br>of lock-in with IT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature <br>update frequency</td>
<td>True software defined storage <br>releases continuously. Often weekly. <br>Customers consume those on <br>demand. This means more features, <br>better security and less disruption.</td>
<td>Worse. Due to their tight <br>performance and availability <br>optimizations, testing must often <br>be more stringent and take <br>longer. This lengthens the interval <br>between feature <br>updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Footprint <br>density</td>
<td>Density traditionally favored appliances <br>- but with boxes like this, <br>that gap has been eliminated.</td>
<td>Appliances control the hardware, <br>and target the densest storage<br>shelves available - even if that<br>requires proprietary hardware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hardware <br>reuseability</td>
<td>Customers can take server and storage <br>hardware out of the cluster anytime <br>they wish and deploy this <br>for other uses. Licensing <br>terms may or may not need <br>to be changed. Server maintenance <br>options are at the discretion <br>of the customer and their <br>server vendor.</td>
<td>Other than using older appliances <br>as slower storage (aka boat anchors) <br>there’s not much that can be done <br>with it. However, to continue <br>to  use appliances as (slower) <br>storage , vendor maintenance contracts <br>will need to be maintained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Complexity</td>
<td>Good software defined storage <br>abstracts complexity. Great software <br>defined storage eliminates it.</td>
<td>A rare bright spot for appliance <br>vendors, the lack of flexibility <br>drives homogeneity and therefore <br>some semblance of simplicity. <br>It is why IT can be fiercely loyal<br>to their vendors.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Ultimately, there is a place for both solutions in the market today but the world is changing. <br></p><p>It burns a lot of cash to run a hardware appliance business. It ties up capital, requires large field sales and field sales support. Appliances are not built for the world we live in today. Further, as we have most famously pointed out - you <a href="https://blog.min.io/high-performance-object-storage-with-kubernetes/">can’t containerize an appliance</a>. Given that Kubernetes is the new normal - it is going to be increasingly difficult to make a living slinging steel. <br></p><p>That is why everyone is eager to say they are a “software-company” these days. Truth is, if their website is adorned with boxes showcasing their logo - it is not a software company. When they tweet a win and show some boxes, that is what they sold - not software. Just because for 45 mins every three months they say words like “revenue from software subscriptions” doesn’t mean they are a software company - it means they are on their quarterly analyst call. <br></p><p>So think about what you really want to achieve. If you want high-performance, Kubernetes-native object storage - choose software. If you want modern application support in addition to archival - choose software. If you want flexibility to design to your use case - choose software. <br></p><p>Don’t, however, choose hardware masquerading as software.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Even before the pandemic, there were a few companies choosing to work shorter weeks. In Japan, Microsoft gave it a try in later part of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/04/776163853/microsoft-japan-says-4-day-workweek-boosted-workers-productivity-by-40" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> and found that doing so increased productivity, reduced stress, and lessened employee burnout. It also had the added benefit of lowering operating costs for that month.</p><p>With COVID-19, average work environments have become even more stressful. Places like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/24/will-coronavirus-pandemic-open-door-four-day-workweek/" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Zealand</a> are acknowledging that there is no "one size fits all" solution to helping companies recover or thrive through the global pandemic.</p><p>What would happen if your company decided to run fewer days per week? Would you discover the same benefits as other companies? To answer this question for yourself, you will have to test the theory in your own company. However, to help you, we have looked to find out how other companies are dealing with COVID-19 and what they have gained from switching to a <a href="https://30hourjobs.com/4-day-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-day work week</a>.</p><h2 id="buffer">Buffer</h2><p>Soon after the pandemic hit, <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/4-day-workweek-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a> became a company that chose to experiment for a single month. Their goal was to reduce the stress that employees and teammates were dealing with because of the global crisis. In June, the company decided to continue their May experiment to last the rest of 2020.</p><p>Why the change from "experiment" to full-time? The answer to this is in the feedback provided by their teammates. It seems unanimous that everyone experienced lower stress levels, increased work happiness, and less burnout. Employees worked more efficiently and effectively in their four days because of how relaxed they felt.</p><p>Although it is only something they are trying for the rest of the year, there is hope that it will continue to prove such an undeniable success.</p><h2 id="elephant-ventures">Elephant Ventures</h2><p><a href="https://www.elephantventures.com/4-day-work-week-resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephant Ventures</a> has been doing 4-day work weeks in the Philippines for the past five years. They have noticed that across the board there is an increase in productivity because workers feel it balances out the work-life scenarios that we all have to face in the workforce.</p><p>In early June, the company closed its doors on their brick and mortar offices in the US. At the time, there was reasonable certainty that the doors would remain closed. However, in August, they decided that this was not what they truly wanted and began trying to come up with a way to meet the needs of clients in the "post Covid-19" world and take tips from their Philippines offices.</p><p>It is a little too soon to tell whether it is an absolute success or not. This does not mean that there isn't a hope that clients and employees will all be happy working this shorter workweek.</p><h2 id="shopify">Shopify</h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/remote-work" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify's</a> employees have embraced the remote/in-office way of working for years. However, in March 2020, they closed the door and went fully remote in an effort to "flatten the curve". The fact that they are working in a digital space by default, has made the transition much easier for them than traditional brick and mortar businesses. They already understand that eliminating bad work habits and strengthening healthier ones is beneficial to everyone.</p><p>In June, Shopify once again changed things up and announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/postcarl/status/1272676581165727746" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> that they would reserve Friday as the day for R&amp;R. Their goal at the time was to enjoy the shorter work week through August. It remains to be seen whether it is extended or not.</p><h2 id="shake-shack">Shake Shack</h2><p>For more than a year, Shake Shack has been <a href="https://www.wabe.org/enjoy-the-extra-day-off-more-bosses-give-4-day-workweek-a-try/" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing</a> the theory of shorter work weeks makes for happier employees. It began with a test run in Las Vegas to give managers an extra day off from work each week, while providing them with the typical 40-hour work week benefits. This means the same pay for fewer hours. With the success of it, the gradually spread out the "testing phase" to include more locations.</p><p>Their findings over the last year, is that employees, especially moms, appreciate working a shorter week because it gives them an extra day to spend with their families. This makes them feel better about being at work, because they do not miss out on taking kids to school, running errands on their day off, and more.</p><p>As the pandemic took hold of the US and all other areas of the globe, <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/updates/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shake Shack</a> did what it could to care for its employees. They still strive to do what they can for the communities that they are a part of.</p><h2 id="radioactive-public-relations">Radioactive Public Relations</h2><p>In June 2019, <a href="https://www.radioactivepr.com/agency-impact-1-year-4-day-pay-work-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radioactive Public Relations</a> reached their one-year benchmark for working shorter work weeks. They were one of the first companies in the UK to give shorter weeks a try and quickly decided to extend their "test" phase.</p><p>Why was the test phase extended? The answer to this is simple. Employees were taking fewer sick days, recruitment was on the rise, business was growing, and employees were happier across the board. The employee happiness reasoning has ranged from enjoying the time with their families to doing things that they wouldn't be able to do if they worked a traditional work week.</p><h2 id="perpetual-guardian">Perpetual Guardian</h2><p>This New Zealand-based company was one of the first to jump on board with shorter work weeks. Andrew Barnes, founder of <a href="https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/the-four-day-week-is-here/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perpetual Guardian</a>, began testing the water with it in 2018. Since then, they have discovered that it encourages employees to work harder while encouraging staff members to organize their time more efficiently while at work.</p><p>Overall, it has lowered the stress level of all who work within the company by allowing them to have more of a life outside the office. Employees can now use their time to take up hobbies, spend time with loved ones, return to school for extra studies, and much more.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about balancing your work/life schedule or want to know more about transitioning to a shorter work week, we are here for you. You can contact us, join our newsletter, and more. Our goal at <a href="https://jobs.30hourjobs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 Hour Jobs</a> is to ensure everyone works the way they want to work.</p>

          <h2>Eliminating Task Processing Outages by Replacing RabbitMQ with Apache Kafka Without Downtime</h2>

          <p><span>Scaling backend infrastructure to handle hyper-growth is one of the many exciting challenges of working at DoorDash. In mid 2019, we faced significant scaling challenges and frequent outages involving </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery_(software)"><span>Celery</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/"><span>RabbitMQ</span></a><span>, two technologies powering the system that handles the asynchronous work enabling critical functionalities of our platform, including order checkout and Dasher assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We quickly solved this problem with a simple, </span><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/"><span>Apache Kafka</span></a><span>-based asynchronous task processing system that stopped our outages while we continued to iterate on a robust solution. Our initial version implemented the smallest set of features needed to accommodate a large portion of existing Celery tasks. Once in production, we continued to add support for more Celery features while addressing novel problems that arose when using Kafka. </span></p>
<h2><span>The problems we faced using Celery and RabbitMQ</span></h2>
<p><span>RabbitMQ and Celery were mission critical pieces of our infrastructure that powered over 900 different asynchronous tasks at DoorDash, including order checkout, merchant order transmission, and Dasher location processing. The problem DoorDash faced was that RabbitMQ was frequently going down due to excessive load. If task processing went down, DoorDash effectively went down and orders could not be completed, resulting in revenue loss for our merchants and Dashers, and a poor experience for our consumers. We faced issues on the following fronts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Availability:</b><span> Outages caused by demand reduced availability.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b><span> RabbitMQ could not scale with the growth of our business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Observability:</b><span> RabbitMQ offered limited metrics and Celery workers were opaque.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Operational efficiency:</b><span> Restarting these components was a time-consuming, manual process.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Why our asynchronous task processing system wasn’t highly available</span></h3>
<p><span>This biggest problem we faced were outages, and they often came when demand was at its peak. RabbitMQ would go down due to load, </span><a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/connections.html#high-connection-churn"><span>excessive connection churn</span></a><span>, and other reasons. Orders would be halted, and we’d have to restart our system or sometimes even bring up an entirely new broker and manually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover"><span>failover</span></a><span> in order to recover from the outage.</span></p>
<p><span>On diving deeper into the availability issues, we found the following sub-issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Celery allows users to schedule tasks in the future with a countdown or ETA. Our heavy use of&nbsp; these countdowns resulted in noticeable load increases on the broker. Some of our outages were directly related to an increase in tasks with countdowns. We ultimately decided to restrict the use of countdowns in favor of another system we had in place for scheduling work in the future.</span></li>
<li><span>Sudden bursts of traffic would leave RabbitMQ in a degraded state where task consumption was significantly lower than expected. In our experience, this could only be resolved with a RabbitMQ bounce. RabbitMQ has a concept of Flow Control where it will reduce the speed of connections which are publishing too quickly so that queues can keep up. Flow Control was often, but not always, involved in these availability degradations. When Flow Control kicks in, the publishers effectively see it as network latency. Network latency reduces our response times; if latency increases during peak traffic, significant slowdowns can result that cascade as requests pile up upstream.</span></li>
<li><span>Our python </span><a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><span>uWSGI</span></a><span> web workers had a feature called harakiri that was enabled to kill any processes that exceeded a timeout. During outages or slowdowns, harakiri resulted in a connection churn to the RabbitMQ brokers as processes were repeatedly killed and restarted. With thousands of web workers running at any given time, any slowness that triggered harakiri would in turn contribute even more to slowness by adding extra load to RabbitMQ.</span></li>
<li><span>In production we experienced several cases where task processing in the Celery consumers&nbsp; stopped, even in the absence of significant load. Our investigation efforts did not yield evidence of any resource constraints that would’ve halted processing, and the workers resumed processing once they were bounced. This problem was never root caused, though we suspect an issue in the Celery workers themselves and not RabbitMQ.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, all of these availability issues were unacceptable for us as high reliability is one of our highest priorities. Since these outages were costing us a lot in terms of missed orders and credibility we needed a solution that would address these problems as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Why our legacy solution did not scale&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The next biggest problem was scale. DoorDash is growing fast and we were quickly reaching the limits of our existing solution. We needed to find something that would keep up with our continued growth since our legacy solution had the following problems:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Hitting the vertical scaling limit</strong></p>
<p><span>We were using the largest available single-node RabbitMQ solution that was available to us. There was no path to scale vertically any further and we were already starting to push that node to its limits.</span></p>
<p><strong>The High Availability mode limited our capacity&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Due to replication, the primary-secondary High Availability (HA) mode reduced throughput compared to the single node option, leaving us with even less headroom than just the single node solution. We could not afford to trade throughput for availability.</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the primary-secondary HA mode did not, in practice, reduce the severity of our outages. Failovers took more than 20&nbsp; minutes&nbsp; to complete and would often get stuck requiring manual intervention. Messages were often lost in the process as well.</span></p>
<p><span>We were quickly running out of headroom as DoorDash continued to grow and push our task processing to its limits. We needed a solution that could scale horizontally as our processing needs grew.</span></p>
<h3><span>How Celery and RabbitMQ offered limited observability</span></h3>
<p><span>Knowing what’s going on in any system is fundamental to ensuring its availability, scalability, and operational integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we navigated the issues outlined above, we noticed that :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We were limited to a small set of RabbitMQ metrics available to us.</span></li>
<li><span>We had limited visibility into the Celery workers themselves.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We needed to be able to see real-time metrics of every aspect of our system which meant the observability limitations needed to be addressed as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The operational efficiency challenges</span></h3>
<p><span>We also faced several issues with operating RabbitMQ:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We often had to failover our RabbitMQ node to a new one to resolve the persistent degradation we observed. This operation was manual and time consuming for the engineers involved and often had to be done late at night, outside of peak times.</span></li>
<li><span>There were no in-house Celery or RabbitMQ experts at DoorDash who we could lean on to help devise a scaling strategy for this technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Engineering time spent operating and maintaining RabbitMQ was not sustainable. We needed something that better met our current and future needs.</span></p>
<h2><span>Potential solutions to our problems with Celery and RabbitMQ&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>With the problems outlined above, we considered the following solutions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Celery broker from RabbitMQ to Redis or Kafka. </b>This would allow us to continue using Celery, with a different and potentially more reliable backing datastore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Add multi-broker support to our </b><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"><b>Django</b></a><b> app so consumers could publish to N different brokers based on whatever logic we wanted. </b>Task processing will get sharded across multiple brokers, so each broker will experience a fraction of the initial load.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade to newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ. </b>Newer versions of Celery and RabbitMQ were expected to fix reliability issues, buying us time as we were already extracting components from our Django monolith in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Migrate to a custom solution backed by Kafka. </b>This solution takes more effort than the other options we listed, but also has more potential to solve every problem we were having with the legacy solution.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Have you ever wondered: “What if clicking on a hyperlink could transport me — not just the screen in front of me — to a new location?”</p><p>That’s what the founders of Uber wondered. So, they transformed an ordinary link into a request for a ride.</p><p>This is called “hacking hypertext”.</p><p>Imagine, a link—a button, a menu, a search result—being able to accomplish something in the real world with a single click.</p><p>Google is a great example of this. They hacked hypertext in two ways: 1) They realized a hyperlink to a page meant that page is more valuable and 2) They gave everyone access to the most valuable links with the click of a Search button.</p><p>Facebook took hyperlinks to the next level by making them represent people and their relationships. Events, messages, profile pages, relationship statuses — all available with a click.</p><p>Who else has hacked hypertext?</p><ul><li>Amazon has 1-Click ordering that makes products show up at your door</li><li>Airbnb lets you rent apartments around the world with a click</li><li>Netflix makes thousands of tv shows and movies accessible with a single click</li></ul><p>These companies transform the good ol’ hyperlink into something incredibly powerful. </p><p>For most of us, though, links are still just plain, boring links.</p><p>As an ordinary person on the internet, I can’t create a link out of thin air that will show a list of my upcoming events or let someone rent my apartment — I rely on Facebook and Airbnb to create these kinds of links. </p><p>So, the question is: <em>why isn’t hypertext more powerful by default?</em></p><p>The answer is: it’s wildly expensive to transform an ordinary hyperlink into something more.</p><p>Big companies like Google and Facebook spend billions of dollars a year building the infrastructure and hiring the talent necessary to support their hypertext hacks.</p><p>Usually, the most an ordinary citizen of the internet can do is use a hyperlink to link to their social media profile or personal website.</p><p>But... what if someone decided to democratize the incredible power these big companies have to hack hypertext?</p><p>What if anyone could hack hypertext?</p><p>More and more companies are buying into the “Low-Code” movement. Companies like Stripe, Webflow, and Shopify are making it easier to create online businesses. And companies like Airtable, Bubble, and Glide are making it possible for ordinary people to build powerful experiences using a set of hypertext hacks they invented.</p><p>But the foundation is still lacking. Hypertext itself hasn’t changed that much in the past three decades. It’s still, by default, pretty weak. It’s meant to create links between pages, not links to real-world actions.</p><p>I believe there’s a stage after “Low-Code”, a kind of hypertext 2.0. Maybe it comes with virtual reality, or cryptocurrency — or maybe it’s born when someone creates a new type of web browser. I don’t know. But, when it comes, it’s going to let anyone have the power to reshape the real world with a good ol’ hyperlink.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>How does QuestDB get the kind of performance it does, and how are we continuing
to squeeze another 50-60% out of it? We are constantly learning more about the
fundamental concepts of memory performance, and this is one example of how what
we at first thought would be <em>worse</em> for performance ended up bringing us a
rather substantial boost in overall memory performance.</p><p>We will walk you through how some of our initial thoughts on storage and
memory-mapping evolved to bring us better performance overall.</p><p>If you like QuestDB, please do give us a star on
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></p><h2>How the performance improvements started</h2><p>QuestDB started out with a single-threaded approach to queries and such. But one
obvious way to improve performance in a Java application like this is to
parallelize as much as you can by using multiple threads of execution.</p><p>I've written multi-threaded applications, and they are not easy to do. It's hard
to coordinate the work between multiple threads, and to make sure that there are
no race conditions, collisions, etc.</p><h2>Storage performance</h2><p>So first it's important to understand that QuestDB stores it's data in columnar
format. We store each column of data in a file. So for every column of data,
there is a file.</p><p>We then split those columns up into data frames that are independent and can be
computed completely independently of each other.</p><p>The problem we encountered with this framing scheme was that it was impossible
to frame variable length data. Data spilled out of the frame, making it
difficult to manage.</p><p>You see, we store fixed length fields with fixed length values, such that
aligning frames to 8 bytes would ensure that all our fixed length data does not
straddle frames. Hence all the columns are the same frame width. But strings and
blobs can't be forced into 8 bytes without making them useless.</p><p>So we could extract extreme performance out of all the fixed-length values, but
these variable-length values dragged the performance back down.</p><p>Which brings us to pages and how data is referenced in memory.</p><h2>Pages of data</h2><p>QuestDB uses memory-mapped pages to reference data in order to make it really
fast. If you're dividing up your data into pages, and all data has a fixed
length, then it's relatively easy to ensure that you don't have data that spans
multiple pages. You just break pages at multiples of 8-bytes and everything will
fit within page boundaries.</p><p>When you add variable-length data, suddenly you cannot ensure that everything
will line up along page boundaries and you will have the very real possibility
-- actually a certainty -- that you may have to jump from one page to another
just to get all the data contained in a frame.</p><p>This, it turns out, is hugely inefficient. If (data is in frame) then (process
that data) else (figure out where the rest of the data is, get that, then
process it all). This kind of if-then-else sprinkled throughout the code is a)
hard to debug and b) leads to lots of branching, which slows down execution.</p><p>In order to prevent variable length data from straddling frames we would need to
have different frame lengths per column. Furthermore, calculating aligned frame
lengths for variable length data is non trivial and requires scanning the entire
data set which would reversing any performance gains from parallelization.</p><h2>One page to rule them all</h2><p>(Yes, I just made a <em>The Highlander</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference</a>)</p><p>What if, in order to get around data being on multiple pages, we simply used
<em>one</em> page for all of the data? Of course my first question was "Don't you at
some point reach a limit on the page size?" but Vlad and Patrick assured me
there is, indeed, no limit on a page size.</p><p>If your page size is bigger than the available memory, the kernel will handle
swapping pages in and out for you as you try to access different parts of the
page. So of course I asked "well then, why didn't you do this from the
beginning?"</p><p>Vlad, in his typically self-deprecating style, just said "We didn't know. We
thought we should keep them to a certain size to keep them from growing out of
control" which, quite frankly, seems like the right answer.</p><p>We'd just resize those smaller pages as needed. But as Vlad explained, if you do
that then you need to copy the data over to the new, resized page and "copying
can take over your life." Databases aren't built to maximize the efficiency of
data copying. They are built to maximize the ability to extract value from data.
Copying data from one page to another isn't extracting value.</p><p>So they tried just allocating a new page, and jumping from one page to the next
as needed to find the required data. This cut down on the copying of data, but
it lead to the problems outlined in the previous section. You never knew which
page your data was going to be on, and jumping from one page to another was
hugely inefficient.</p><p>So they tried having just the one page. One massive page (that you can grow as
needed, without copying data around). Vlad, again in his style, said the
performance turned out to be "not bad" with this approach. And by "not bad" he
of course meant about a 60% performance improvement.</p><p>When you get into using one single page, of course the total available address
space comes into play. But since QuestDB only runs on 64-bit architectures, we
have 2^64 address space, which is more than enough.</p><p>This is where Patrick jumped in to explain that when you have an area of memory
mapped from a file, when the file grows you remap the new size into memory. The
operating system does not need to copy anything; the virtual memory model allows
the OS to just remap the already mapped pages into the newly mapped memory
region. In many cases, the OS may have already reserved the entire address space
for you so your new mapping is in the same region as the old, just bigger.</p><h2>Kernels are smart</h2><p>The kernel allocated a full sized address space for your file when you requested
the memory-mapped file. And apparently this is true across Linux, macOS and
Windows. So from that point on, there's really no further copying that needs to
happen.</p><p>Furthermore, the kernel is going to handle paging parts of that file in and out
of memory as needed. Now, I'm old-school Unix, and page-swapping which lead to
thrashing was always something we worried about back in the olden days. So I
asked about it. According to Patrick, this could only happen really if you have
a massive file that you are reading basically randomly at high speed. Other than
that, the kernel will handle reading ahead and pre-loading pages as needed in
order to be as efficient as possible.</p><p>Kernels, it turns out, are smart. In fact, kernels are basically smarter than
you or I will ever hope to be. They've been developed across decades to be
hugely efficient at doing these things. It's what they do. The kernel will
memory map the file into the file cache and even if it needs to move stuff
around, it can move the logical address and it's still the same underlying
physical memory pages.</p><p>If you think that you can take over caching the data from the OS and do a better
job of managing the memory space, and the allocation and re-allocation of the
memory, you're wrong. Again, this is what the Kernel does, and at some level,
even if you try to take this job away from the kernel, it is <em>still</em> doing some
amount of it anyway. So your attempts to take this memory management and
allocation away from the kernel has done little more than just add another layer
on top of what the kernel is doing anyway. Another layer on top of something is
basically never more efficient than the original thing.</p><p>When you read an offset into a file, you send a buffer to read into, the address
to start reading at, and the offset into the file. Now, the kernel is going to
cache all of that for you as you do it, because that's the kernel's job, really.
But many database developers then take that, and cache it themselves, with their
own caching scheme.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>When I asked Vlad about this, and how it relates to query speed, he was quite
explicit in saying that thinking you (a database developer) can beat the kernel
is pure folly. Postgres tries this and, according to Vlad, an aggregation over a
large (really large!) dataset can take 5 <em>minutes</em>, whereas the same aggregation
on QuestDB takes only 60ms. Those aren't typos.</p><p>To both Patrick and Vlad (and me, for what that's worth), the idea that we, as
developers, can be better at these operations than the kernel (when really we're
doing them <em>on top of</em> the kernel anyway) is simply ridiculous. If I take an
army of researchers and spend a decade of development, then <em>maybe</em> I can do it
better than the kernel, but during that time guess what? The army of people
working on the kernel will have found further improvements and left me behind
anyway.</p><p>It comes down to letting the kernel do its job, and us doing ours. And our job
is to exploit the kernel for every ounce of performance we can get out of it
without trying to do it's job for it.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>When it comes to performance claims, we always try to back them up with actual
numbers that can be replicated. You can run these tests yourself, and you can
always go and look at the
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/tree/master/benchmarks/src/main/java/org/questdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source code</a>

September 4, 2020 | https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://capsule.click/posts/you-dont-need-staging-environments.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>
  Theoretically, staging environments sound nice. Why wouldn’t you want
  something that previews what the code will look like before production? The
  issue is what happens in practice.
</p>
<p>
  It’s a big ask. To show how much of a big ask it is let’s walk through an
  example. Say that there’s a developer named Bob. Bob works in a 7 person
  startup that is building a SaaS tool. Their stack has three parts: a static
  HTML frontend, a node backend, and a Postgres server.
</p>
<p>
  This week, one of Bob’s goals is to set up a staging environment to get those
  sweet sweet previews everyone’s been talking about. It looks simple enough,
  they’re already using serverless to deploy their frontend so the job is
  reduced down to hooking up some pipeline to deploy a version of the frontend
  for each new commit on a separate subdomain.
</p>
<h4>Issue 1: Version Incompatibilities With The Backend</h4>
<p>
  That works and he’s happy. Two weeks later though, there are some issues. The
  team is working on a major feature that’s been in development for the past few
  days on a separate branch. It includes both changes to the frontend and a new
  endpoint on the backend. So the staging environment crashes because it tries
  to talk to the backend while the backend doesn’t have the endpoint. The
  solution? Give the staging environment its backend. Bob wrangles the pipeline
  a bit to deploy a backend and a frontend for each change. After a few days of
  work, it’s done and he’s happy.
</p>
<h4>Issue 2: Handing Database Schema Changes</h4>
<p>
  Three weeks later, there's an issue again. Now the team is working on a
  feature that includes a schema change on the database. They can’t use the
  staging environment because the server crashes due to incompatibility with the
  database. The solution seems clear. Bring the database into the staging
  environment. He wrangles the pipeline to spin up a new DB for each commit and
  run migration scripts on startup every time. Now the staging environment is a
  complete miniature copy of what’s happening in production. There shouldn’t be
  any more issues going forward. Right?
</p>
<h4>Issue 3: Maintaining The Codebase For Different Target Environments</h4>
<p>
  Wrong. Bob notices something unexpected. The team is using staging
  environments less than before. Turns out it's a hassle to have to create a new
  user account and generate content every time they want to test things on the
  staging environment. They started seeding the staging database on startup, but
  then realized they now have to maintain code to seed the database for each
  table inside it, and that’s a hassle.
</p>
<p>
  <b>As the staging environment grew more complicated, it became less easy to
    work with.</b>
  In the future, the backend might need another service to function like a Redis
  instance or a new microservice. That’s gonna have to go into the staging
  environment too. Maybe Bob should have stopped at just the frontend and kept
  the staging environment hooked up to the production backend.
</p>
<p>
  But then the team risks incompatibility issues when the staging frontend
  expects a different version of the production backend it’s talking to. At
  best, the frontend will throw errors occasionally, at
  <b> worst it will silently leave corrupted data on the database</b>.
</p>
<h4>Staging Isn't Easy</h4>
<p>
  If your team doesn't have the bandwidth or the resources to build a pipeline
  that can spin up entire miniature copies of the production environment,
  <b>staging isn't for you</b>. The biggest draw for staging environments is to
  visually inspect changes to the frontend. The backend parts of the codebase
  can often be more conveniently verified through testing.
</p>
<p>
  For previewing frontends, we built Capsule for developers like Bob’s team. You
  can use the extension to make HTML recordings of the frontend. Just by linking
  to your capsule in the PRs, you'd be able to do the same thing a staging
  environment can do with none of the work of maintaining a staging environment
  pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Say that I was part of the google calendar team, and wanted to share my local
  changes. I click on the extension, and boom:
</p>

<p>
  I have a shareable link to my changes. No maintance; no deployment pipelines
  needed.
</p>

						<p>It’s easy to imagine that governments were always as bureaucratic as they are today. Certain policies, like the widespread granting of monopolies in the seventeenth century, or the presence of a powerful landed aristocracy, seem like archaic products of a past that was simply more corrupt. The fact that governments rarely got involved with healthcare or education before the mid-nineteenth century seems the product of a lack of imagination, or perhaps yet another product of our ancestors’ venality – simply what happens when you put the war-hungry knights and nobles in charge.</p>
<p>But the bureaucratic state of today, with its officials involving themselves with every aspect of modern life, is a relatively recent invention. In a world without bureaucracy, when state capacity was relatively lacking, it’s difficult to see what other options monarchs would have had. Suppose yourself transported to the throne of England in 1500, and crowned monarch. Once you bored of the novelty and luxuries of being head of state, you might become concerned about the lot of the common man and woman. Yet even if you wanted to create a healthcare system, or make education free and universal to all children, or even create a police force (London didn’t get one until 1829, and the rest of the country not til much later), there is absolutely no way you could succeed.</p>
<p>For a start, you would struggle to maintain your hold on power. Fund schools you say? Somebody will have to pay. The nobles? Well, try to tax them — in many European states they were exempt from taxation — and you might quickly lose both your throne and your head. And supposing you do manage to tax them, after miraculously stamping out an insurrection without their support, how would you even begin to go about collecting it? There was simply no central government agency capable of raising it. Working out how much people should pay, chasing up non-payers, and even the physical act of collection, not to mention protecting that treasure once collected, all takes substantial manpower. Not to mention the fact that the collecting agents will likely siphon most of it off to line their own pockets.</p>
<p>As a monarch in 1500, you would be forced to rely heavily on delegation. As the economic historian Jared Rubin emphasizes, every ruler requires agents to propagate their rule. These can take the form of big burly blokes with heavy weapons — your enforcers — and they can take the form of people spreading the ideology of your right to rule, lending your orders legitimacy and more generally spreading social norms of obedience — the local officials, jurists, and clerics. Crucially, these propagating agents needed to be kept on-side at all costs. Hence the tax exemptions for nobles, many of whom were rich enough to support their own private armies, and whose ancestors might have been granted such a privilege by one of your predecessors.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc’s village, for example, was exempted from taxation <i>forever,</i> because of her role in restoring the French king’s military fortunes. And hence the control often exerted over policy by religious figures, who could give one’s rule divine sanction in the eyes of the people. It is no surprise that the emperors of China carefully cultivated themselves at the head of as many religions as possible (one of the reasons that Christianity, with its rather awkward stress on Jesus being the king of kings, was occasionally banned from the empire). As economic historians Mark Koyama and Noel Johnson argue, this focus on appeasing religious legitimisers was one of the reasons rulers so often sought to stamp out heretics and heathens.</p>
<p>Even beyond satisfying the propagating agents, however, core state activities like tax collection were heavily reliant on delegation of authority. Absent an expensive bureaucracy to do it on your behalf, it was much easier to farm out the activity to others. When taxing a predominantly agrarian society — in 1500, only 3.6% of England’s population lived in cities — it made most sense to appoint a local noble to be tax farmer for an area. As a local, they would know the area well, and the products of the land are relatively straightforward to tax. It’s not exactly easy to hide. And as for the tax farmer, they could be remunerated by taking a cut of what they collected. Corrupt, yes. But inevitable and even seen as legitimate, given the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>Your capacity as a ruler was thus entirely governed by the <em>quid pro quo</em>, and heavily restricted by the deals made by your predecessors. Cities were granted charters, giving them various rights of self-governance, in return for collecting taxes from among their own members (commerce and industry being much harder to tax than land, and thus requiring more consent). And, of course, there were occasionally times when the defence of the realm might require extra taxes — for such instances, rulers convened parliaments. Taxes raised by parliaments were referred to, somewhat confusingly, as “subsidies”. But that is exactly what they were: special subsidies granted to the monarch, by the collected representatives of the nobles and the various other propagating agents, for a one-off extraordinary purpose – albeit giving those collected agents some say over policy.</p>
<p>It was not until 1689, when there was a coup, that an incoming ruler allowed the English parliament to sit whenever it pleased. Before that, it was convened only at the whim of the ruler, and dispersed even at the slightest provocation. In 1621, for example, when James I was planning to marry his heir to a Spanish princess, Parliament sent him a petition asserting their right to debate the matter. Upon hearing of it, he called for the official record of parliamentary proceedings, personally ripped out the page with the offending vote, and promptly dissolved the Parliament. The downside, of course, was that James could not then acquire any parliamentary subsidies.</p>
<p>Ruling was thus an intensely personal affair, of making deals and finding ways to circumvent deals you had inherited. Increasing your capabilities as a ruler – state capacity – was thus no easy task, as the typical ruler was stuck in an essentially medieval equilibrium. Imposing a policy costs money, but raising money involves imposing policy. Breaking out of this chicken-and-egg problem took centuries of canny leadership. The rulers who achieved it most would today seem hopelessly corrupt.</p>
<p>To gain extra cash without interference from Parliament, successive monarchs first asserted and then abused their ancient prerogative rights to grant monopolies over trades and industries. They eventually granted them to whomever was willing to pay, establishing monopolies over industries like gambling cards or alehouses under the guise of regulating unsavoury activities. They also sold off knighthoods and titles, and in 1670 Charles II even made a secret deal with the French that he would convert to Catholicism and attack the Protestant Dutch, all in exchange for cash. Anything to not have to call a potentially pesky Parliament. At times, the most effective rulers even resembled mob bosses. Take Elizabeth I’s anger when a cloth-laden merchant fleet bound for an Antwerp fair in 1559 was allowed to depart. Her order to stop them had not arrived in time, thus preventing her from extracting “loans” from the merchants while she still had their goods within her power.</p>
<p>Yet, ironically, it was when monarchs lost control that they did most to boost the capabilities of the centralised state. It was under Parliament, first in the 1650s when it briefly overthrew the monarchy, and then from the late 1680s following its deal with the usurping William III, that British state capacity began to most rapidly and inexorably grow. Likewise, in France, it was following the French Revolution that the steady rise of state capacity was boosted — it was then, over three centuries after the fact, that the perpetual tax exemptions for Joan of Arc’s village were finally rescinded.</p>
<p>Parliaments, as bodies of legitimising agents, despite their lack of representation in any modern democratic sense, had the unquestioned legitimacy with which to raise taxes, change policy, and undo the deals of previous monarchs. In the process, they often trampled on the ancient liberties of citizens and subjects. But, unlike monarchs, they found it much easier to force the changes through. When motivated by the needs of war — often the one thing members could agree on — parliaments in the eighteenth century were able to raise cash that would have been unfathomable to the monarchs of even a few decades before. And it was parliaments, also, that were eventually susceptible in the nineteenth century to the lobbying of those who wished the state to involve itself in areas like education, health, and policing.</p>
<p>The route to state capacity thus took centuries of blood, dirty dealing, corruption and campaigning to make the states we have to today. But it is difficult to see how it could have been done in any other way.</p>

<h3>Learn how to implement an automated machine learning strategy with the goal of finding the optimal stocks for algorithmic trading.</h3>



<hr>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/0*Qin1Uu6TF6EGY9Qe" alt="Image for post" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@stephenleo1982?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Leonardi</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p id="761b">With the increasing popularity of machine learning, many traders are looking for ways in which they can “teach” a computer to trade for them. This process is called algorithmic trading (sometimes called algo-trading).</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Algorithmic trading is a hands off strategy for buying and selling stocks that leverages technical indicators instead of human intuition.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p id="8e73">In order to implement an algorithmic trading strategy though, you have to first narrow down a list of stocks that you want to analyze. This walk-through provides an automated process (using python and logistic regression) for determining the best stocks to algo-trade.</p>



<p id="45b0">I will dive deeper into the logic and code below, but here is a high-level overview of the process:</p>



<ol><li>Import the historical data of every stock using yahoo finance.</li><li>Pull in over 32 technical indicators for each stock using the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</li><li>Perform a logistic regression on each stock using 5, 30, and 60 day observation time periods.</li><li>Interpret the results.</li></ol>

<h2 id="7355">Import Necessary Libraries</h2>



<p id="9268">Running this program in python requires these libraries:</p>

<h2 id="8a50">Collecting Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="b37a">Obtaining historical data on the stocks that we want to observe is a two-step process.</p>



<ol><li>Narrow down a list of stocks that we want to observe.</li><li>Make individual calls to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yfinance API</a>&nbsp;in order to import data about each company.</li></ol>



<p id="d925"><strong>Choosing the Stocks We Want to Target</strong></p>



<p id="b1b8">The library&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/shilewenuw/get_all_tickers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get-all-tickers</a>&nbsp;allows us to compile a list of stock tickers by filtering companies on aspects like market cap or exchange. For this example, I am looking at companies that have a market cap between $150,000 and $10,000,000 (in millions).</p>



<p id="b0b7">You will notice that I also included a line of code to print the number of tickers we are using. This is very important. You will need to be sure that you are not targeting more than 2,000 tickers, because the Yfinance API has a 2,000 API calls per hour limit.</p>



<p id="a75a">We also need to remove and create a folder on our local machine to hold historical stock data. Note that before this step runs for the first time, you will need to manually create this folder. This step is important because it will get rid of the data from past iterations and allow the program to start new.</p>



<div><pre data-file="https://gist.github.com/cameronShadmehry/7fd146a70470186482eadefde6dec7ea#file-atlr_gettickers-py" data-lang="Python"><code># List of the stocks we are interested in analyzing. At the time of writing this, it narrows the list of stocks down to 44.
# If you have a list of your own you would like to use just create a new list instead of using this, for example: tickers = ["FB", "AMZN", ...] 
tickers = gt.get_tickers_filtered(mktcap_min=150000, mktcap_max=10000000)

# Check that the amount of tickers isn't more than 2000
print("The amount of stocks chosen to observe: " + str(len(tickers)))

# These two lines remove the Stocks folder and then recreate it in order to remove old stocks. Make sure you have created a Stocks Folder the first time you run this.

<h2 id="c45e">Importing Historical Stock Data</h2>



<p id="1c9d">We will now obtain the historical price data of each stock in our tickers list by making independent calls to Yahoo Finance. After receiving the data, the program will save each company’s information in a new CSV file that will be located in the folder you created beforehand.</p>

Amount_of_API_Calls = 0

# This while loop is reponsible for storing the historical data for each ticker in our list. Note that yahoo finance sometimes incurs json.decode errors and because of this we are sleeping for 2
# seconds after each iteration, also if a call fails we are going to try to execute it again.
# Also, do not make more than 2,000 calls per hour or 48,000 calls per day or Yahoo Finance may block your IP. The clause "(Amount_of_API_Calls &lt; 1800)" below will stop the loop from making
# too many calls to the yfinance API.

<h2 id="2687">Importing Technical Indicators</h2>



<p id="a921">In order to run a logistic regression on each stock, we need to substantiate the independent variables. These 32+ technical indicators will act as predictor variables for the dependent variable.</p>



<p id="6e7c">To bring in the technical indicators we make use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bukosabino/ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical analysis library</a>.</p>



<p id="1d04">You will also notice that we are creating three extra columns. These will act as the value we are trying to predict (dependent variable) with the model. The three variables are 5, 30, and 60 day observations of the closing prices of each stock (1 if it increased and 0 if it did not).</p>

				<div>
					<p>My heart was racing. My palms sweating. I was going to be fired.</p><p>Performance reviews had just ended, and it was time to meet my manager and be told my results. Except I knew what it would say. How else do you rate a programmer who doesn’t code?</p><p>As I stood up from my desk, my eyes fell on my Ship-it plaque, congratulating me for helping release Windows 7. I had joined Microsoft a mere two weeks before it was released, a fresh college hire. There wasn’t a single character I had contributed to that code.</p><p>The plaque was a lie. Just like me.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/cropped-plaque.png 1325w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My manager had booked a private conference room to share the results, far away from ears that might overhear anything said. Or begged. The long walk began, each step echoing down the corridor.</p><p>I racked my brains, grasping for an excuse to justify keeping my job. Instead my mind kept going back to the last bug I was supposed to fix. I’d spent all day failing to find the problem, finally giving in and asking a teammate for help. He found it in 10 minutes. I was way out of my league.</p><p>My boss must have seen it too, I bet that was why he assigned me, the kid, to help government auditors analyze our source code. Help <em>them</em>? I barely understood it myself! But this was more of a “people project.” If it didn’t require writing code, why waste real programmers on it? And so it came to me. I barely stayed afloat, constantly asking my manager for explanations and struggling to relay them to the auditors.</p><p>Yeah, I was doomed.</p><p>How would I tell my parents? Would I ever get another job? The only coding I did here was with an obsolete technology that no other company cared about; I didn’t even have the skills to land a new job.</p><p>What made me think I could work at Microsoft?</p><p>I reached the conference room, could I stall any longer? Huh, It’s the same room he interviewed me in two years ago. I doubt he remembers.</p><p>Okay, this is it. Deep breath, poker face on. No matter what, I wouldn’t let him <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares#tip-3-be-open-to-learning-during-the-interview">see me sweat</a>.</p><p>I stepped inside. Scott was sitting at the table, laptop carefully angled to hide the screen.</p><p>“Have a seat” he said, gesturing to his right. As I sat down, Scott looked straight at me. He opened his mouth to give me the news. But it wasn’t what I expected.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve been promoted”</p><p>Huh? No way I heard that right. Keep that poker face tight.</p><p>“Keep up the great work! Anything you’d like to ask?”</p><p>Wait but...when did I...what?</p><p>He hadn’t noticed? I wasn’t about to point out his mistake. Can’t let any surprise show.</p><p>“Great, thanks.” That was all I trusted myself to say.</p><p>I was safe. For now.</p><p>He’d catch on in a few months, I was sure. I couldn’t hide forever.</p><p>I spent the next few years preparing for that inevitable day, desperately trying to work on projects that could teach me the skills that would catch a recruiter’s eye. I had to become hireable.</p><p>I needed a stronger resume, with skills people cared about. I switched to a new team which built stuff for the cloud: Azure Web Apps. Companies love the cloud, right? Surely I’ll learn industry relevant skills there.</p><p>Fast forward four years: I still didn’t feel like I was anything special, yet I kept getting promoted. I kept fooling them somehow, the <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/hacking-the-bureaucracy-to-get-stuff-done/">bureaucratic</a> review process hiding my flaws. But something else also started happening, hinting that, just maybe, I wasn’t as clueless as I thought.</p><p>What changed?</p><p>People started coming to me for answers.</p><p>I still didn’t feel like I knew that much. I was just telling people about the stuff I’d worked on, occasionally pointing younger engineers towards tactics I had seen work well. That didn’t feel like anything original, but folks were finding it useful.</p><p>It got really weird when the more senior engineers started asking <em>me </em>about the code base. These were brilliant people who had often helped me over the years. Didn’t they already know everything?</p><p>I guess not, but they were still way above my league. It’s not like I knew enough to offer <em>them </em>real advice.</p><p>But still...my team seemed to think I was doing well. Would other companies think so too? Was I finally hireable? Only one way to find out: I started <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/the-interviewing-advice-no-one-shares">applying</a>.</p><p>I couldn’t believe the results when multiple job offers came in. And one was from Google! I couldn’t pass that one up. I made the switch.</p><p>During orientation, Google spent a lot of time discussing Impostor Syndrome, the feeling of accomplished people belittling their own talents and constantly being terrified of being discovered as a fraud. That’s a thing?</p><p>“Raise your hand if you have this feeling” Hah, yeah right, and have me be the only one raising my...oh, wow, that’s a lot of hands. Mine joined the crowd.</p><p>As I started working, impostor syndrome came up constantly. It was mentioned at company meetings, folks made memes admitting to it. It was everywhere.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/when-someone-comments-on-my-design-doc.gif" alt=""></figure><p>People freely admitted to not knowing stuff. Teammates admitted to not understanding the code, or having no idea how a tool worked. All the stuff I didn’t know, many others didn’t get either.</p><p>Seeing everyone admit their ignorance <strong>freed me</strong> from my own fear. Suddenly, feeling clueless seemed normal. &nbsp;It was a psychological quirk, not the truth.</p><p>My self-confidence grew. And gradually, without quite realizing it, something magical happened.</p><p>Impostor syndrome became a tool. I discovered the <strong>impostor’s advantage</strong>.</p><p>Did I notice feeling intimidated about asking a question? I started pushing myself to ask that question. Turns out other people had felt afraid as well, asking that question helped improve everyone’s understanding. &nbsp;When I started openly admitting to being unfamiliar with a tool or some code, my teammates felt like less of an impostor themselves. Their confidence went up. And they in turn became more likely to admit the same, creating a virtuous cycle boosting the entire team’s morale.</p><p>The impostor’s advantage was a super power.</p><p>And it offered new insights.</p><p>That feeling of being an impostor is your subconscious telling you something: It’s saying you’re about to push yourself past your comfort zone and into the growth zone. Now when an opportunity shows up and impostor syndrome starts twitching in the pit of my stomach, <strong>that’s a sign I should jump at it!</strong> This led me to take on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/whats-it-like-as-a-senior-engineer/#research-like-a-detective">bigger and more ambitious</a> projects, without worrying about being exposed. Somehow I still delivered results, helped by the various people I was no longer afraid to reach out to.</p><p>Every project still started with the thought, “I have no idea what to do here.” But then I’d remind myself, “no one else does either.” That was a surprising lesson about the more senior positions: <strong>Their work is so valuable </strong><em><strong>precisely because </strong></em><strong>no one knows exactly what needs to be done. It’s ambiguous.</strong> And it requires people who can still push through the uncertainty and forge a path forward.</p><p>They embrace the impostor’s advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/i-feel-like-an-impostor.png 666w"></figure><p>Looking back, I realize now that in my early days I'd been evaluating myself with biased glasses. &nbsp;<strong>I was comparing myself to people much more senior than me</strong>. Of course there would be a skill gap. <strong>If one person understood something, I assumed everyone knew it</strong>. That was false. As the “systems grow it’s impossible for one person to keep it all in their head”[1]; each person just knew the areas they had personally worked on.</p><p>My biggest mistake: <strong>I didn’t value the soft skills I brought to the table</strong>. Fresh out of college I had taken a significant load off my manager's plate by being the main point of contact with auditors and other teams. The fact that I was not writing code made me think I wasn’t doing anything useful, when in fact the soft skill of being able to work with them was incredibly valuable to the team.</p><p>As I continue working and taking on bigger projects, I suspect impostor syndrome will never completely go away. But now I take that as a good thing. An advantage. It’s a sign that I’m growing and stretching myself past my comfort zone.</p><p>And in thost darkest moments, when self doubt is at its highest, I remind myself:</p><p>I haven’t been fired yet.</p><p>[1] <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897">The Manager’s Path</a></em>, by &nbsp;Camille Fournier</p>

						<p><em>Der CCC richtet in diesem Jahr erstmalig die Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) statt einer Veranstaltung vor Ort in Leipzig aus.<br>
</em><em>Dafür braucht es Kreativität, Experimentierfreude und tatkräftige Unterstützung.</em></p>
<p>[<a href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/#english">English Version below</a>]</p>
<p>Eine Präsenzveranstaltung mit 17.000 Menschen wird in diesem Jahr weder verantwortungsvoll noch legal durchführbar sein.<br>
Aber nach der Durststrecke 2020 haben wir uns ein schönes Jahresende redlich verdient! Deshalb wird es die rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience geben.<br>
Wir wollen so viel wie möglich von Freude, Inhalten, Zusammensein und wunderbarem Wahnsinn transportieren, die einen Chaos Communication Congress ausmachen.</p>
<p>Hackerinnen sind remote-Arbeit und -Zusammenkünfte gewohnt. Umso wichtiger ist das jährliche persönliche Treffen.<br>
Natürlich wird es schwierig, all den Wahnsinn online abzubilden, der den Congress für uns ausmacht.<br>
Doch dann sagte jemand, es wäre unmöglich. Unser Ehrgeiz war geweckt.<br>
Wir wollen sehen, wie sich die geballte Energie und Kreativität der Hackerinnen dieser Herausforderung widmet.</p>
<h2>Was erwartet mich?</h2>
<p>Die rC3 wird eine Vielzahl von <strong>kleinen lokalen Events</strong> in den örtlichen Hackspaces <strong>mit einem gemeinsamen Programm</strong> von gestreamten Talks, Online-Workshops, Kunst, Kultur und verschiedensten Formen des vernetzten Zusammenseins.</p>
<p>In den vergangenen Monaten konnte der Club mit dem <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digital verteilten Online-Chaos</a> wichtige Erfahrungen sammeln. Für die rC3 gilt es, noch darüber hinauswachsen. Dafür werden alle gebraucht, die mitmachen und mitgestalten wollen.</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mich einbringen?</h2>
<p>Du hattest schon immer großartige Ideen für den Congress – aber dir hat der Platz dafür gefehlt?<br>
Physische Limitierungen schränken dich ohnehin nur unnötig ein?</p>
<p>Willkommen im Internet! Hier können wir bisher für unmöglich gehaltene Dinge entwickeln!<br>
Endlich kann auch dein Wohnzimmer oder euer Hackspace zur Bühne, zum weltweiten Workshop-Space, zur Kunst-Installation werden!</p>
<p>Unser aller Kreativität ist es, die den Congress für alle zum Wunderland macht.<br>
Die vielen Workshops sind es, die jedes Jahr jung und alt für Neues begeistern.<br>
Großartige Vorträge vermitteln jedes Jahr neues Wissen aus Wissenschaft, Technik und Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>Was sind Deine Ideen für eine Online-Welt?</p>
<h2>Wie kann ich mitgestalten? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In den nächsten Wochen wird es <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">an dieser Stelle</a> einen Call for Participation geben. Die Content-Track-Teams freuen sich schon auf eure kreativen Einreichungen und Format-Ideen!</p>

<p><em>This year, CCC hosts the Remote Chaos Experience (rC3) instead of an on-site event in Leipzig.<br>
This endeavor requires creativity, joy of experimentation and active support.</em></p>
<p>A face-to-face event with 17,000 people will be neither responsible nor legally feasible this year. But after this tedious and painful 2020, we really deserve a nice finale!<br>
This is why the rC3 – Remote Chaos Experience will be held.<br>
As much as virtually possible, we want to convey the joy, content, togetherness and wonderful madness that make up a Chaos Communication Congress.</p>
<p>Hackers are used to remote work and online meetings. This makes our annual face-to-face meetings all the more important. Of course, it will be difficult to re-enact online all the things that make Congress what it is for us.<br>
But then someone said it would be impossible. Our ambition was aroused.<br>
Just like every year, we want to see the concentrated energy and creativity of hackers with dedication.</p>
<h2>What can I expect?</h2>
<p>rC3 will be a variety of <strong>distributed small local events</strong> in hackspaces <strong>with a joint program </strong>of streamed talks, online workshops, art, culture and various forms of networked togetherness.</p>
<p>In recent months, CCC has gained quite some experience with <a href="https://events.ccc.de/?s=divoc">digitally distributed online chaos</a> events.<br>
With rC3, we want to grow even beyond that. For this, we need everyone who wants to participate and help shape rC3.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>You always had great ideas for Congress – but you lacked the space for it?<br>
Common restrictions of the physical world are annoying limitations to your creativity anyway?</p>
<p>Welcome to the Internet! Here, we can develop things that have been impossible so far!<br>
Finally, your living room or hackspace can become a stage, a worldwide workshop space, an art installation!</p>
<p>It’s all our creativity that makes the Congress a wonderland for everyone.<br>
It is the many workshops that inspire young and old for new things every year.<br>
Great lectures convey new knowledge from science, technology and society every year.</p>
<p>What are your ideas for an online gathering?</p>
<h2>How can I bring in my ideas? Have your say!</h2>
<p>In the next weeks, there will be a Call for Participation <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">at this site</a>. The content track teams are already looking forward to your creative submissions and format ideas!</p>
<p>Until then, we want to collect ideas on how we want to unfold rC3 together.<br>
What do we expect from a remote event?<br>
What new formats, games and easter-eggs are possible?<br>
What can we contribute?<br>
And what mistakes should the C3 teams avoid while planning?</p>
<p>We are looking forward to any input under<br>
<strong><a href="https://content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay/">content.events.ccc.de/haveyoursay</a></strong></p>

<p>This summer, I am again <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/11/research-assistant.html">working on Rust full-time</a>, and again I will work (amongst other things) on a “memory model” for Rust/MIR.
However, before I can talk about the ideas I have for this year, I have to finally take the time and dispel the myth that “pointers are simple: they are just integers”.
Both parts of this statement are false, at least in languages with unsafe features like Rust or C: Pointers are neither simple nor (just) integers.</p>

<p>I also want to define a piece of the memory model that has to be fixed before we can even talk about some of the more complex parts: Just what <em>is</em> the data that is stored in memory?
It is organized in bytes, the minimal addressable unit and the smallest piece that can be accessed (at least on most platforms), but what are the possible values of a byte?
Again, it turns out “it’s just an 8-bit integer” does not actually work as the answer.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of this post, you will agree with me on both of these statements. :)</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<h2 id="pointers-are-complicated">Pointers Are Complicated</h2>

<p>What is the problem with “pointers are just integers”?  Let us consider the following example:<br>
(I am using C++ code here mostly because writing unsafe code is easier in C++ than in Rust, and unsafe code is where these problems really show up. C has all the same issues, as does unsafe Rust.)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>/* some side-effect-free computation */</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It would be beneficial to be able to optimize the final read of <code>y[0]</code> to just return <code>42</code>.
The justification for this optimization is that writing to <code>x_ptr</code>, which points into <code>x</code>, cannot change <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>However, given how low-level a language C++ is, we can actually break this assumption by setting <code>i</code> to <code>y-x</code>.
Since <code>&amp;x[i]</code> is the same as <code>x+i</code>, this means we are actually writing <code>23</code> to <code>&amp;y[0]</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, that does not stop C++ compilers from doing these optimizations.
To allow this, the standard declares our code to have <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/14/undefined-behavior.html">undefined behavior</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, it is not allowed to perform pointer arithmetic (like <code>&amp;x[i]</code> does) that goes <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">beyond either end of the array it started in</a>.
Our program violates this rule: <code>x[i]</code> is outside of <code>x</code>, so this is undefined behavior.
To be clear: Just the <em>computation</em> of <code>x_ptr</code> is already UB, we don’t even get to the part where we want to <em>use</em> this pointer!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But we are not done yet: This rule has a special exception that we can exploit to our advantage.
If the arithmetic ends up computing a pointer <em>just past</em> the end of an allocation, that computation is fine.
(This exception is necessary to permit computing <code>vec.end()</code> for the usual kind of C++98 iterator loop.)</p>

<p>So let us change this example a bit:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>int</span><span>[</span><span>8</span><span>];</span>
    <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>+</span><span>8</span><span>;</span> <span>// one past the end</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>==</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
      <span>*</span><span>x_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>y</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, imagine that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have been allocated <em>right next to each other</em>, with <code>y</code> having the higher address.
Then <code>x_ptr</code> actually points <em>right at the beginning</em> of <code>y</code>!
The conditional is true and the write happens.
Still, there is no UB due to out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic.</p>

<p>This seems to break the optimization.
However, the C++ standard has another trick up its sleeve to help compiler writers: It doesn’t actually allow us to <em>use</em> our <code>x_ptr</code> above.
According to what the standard says about <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#5">addition on pointers</a>, <code>x_ptr</code> points “one past the last element of the array object”.
It does <em>not</em> point at an actual element of another object <em>even if they have the same address</em>. (At least, that is the common interpretation of the standard based on which <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/vxmtej">LLVM optimizes this code</a>.)</p>

<p>The key point here is that just because <code>x_ptr</code> and <code>&amp;y[0]</code> point to the same <em>address</em>, that does not make them <em>the same pointer</em>, i.e., they cannot be used interchangeably:
<code>&amp;y[0]</code> points to the first element of <code>y</code>; <code>x_ptr</code> points past the end of <code>x</code>.
If we replace <code>*x_ptr = 23</code> by <code>*&amp;y[0] = 0</code>, we change the meaning of the program, even though the two pointers have been tested for equality.</p>

<p>This is worth repeating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal and can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this sounds subtle, it is.
In fact, this still causes miscompilations in both <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35229">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65752">GCC</a>.</p>

<p>Also notice that this one-past-the-end rule is not the only part of C/C++ where this effect can be witnessed.
Another example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict"><code>restrict</code></a> keyword in C, which can be used to express that pointers do not alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>*</span><span>restrict</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>*</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>*</span><span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>23</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>*</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Calling <code>test()</code> triggers UB because the two accesses in <code>foo</code> must not alias.
Replacing <code>*y</code> by <code>*x</code> in <code>foo</code> changes the meaning of the program such that it no longer has UB.
So, again, even though <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the same address, they cannot be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Pointers are definitely not integers.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-pointer-model">A Simple Pointer Model</h2>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> a pointer?
I don’t know the full answer to this.
In fact, this is an open area of research.</p>

<p>One important point to stress here is that we are just looking for an <em>abstract model</em> of the pointer.
Of course, on the actual machine, pointers are integers.
But the actual machine also does not do the kind of optimizations that modern C++ compilers do, so it can get away with that.
If we wrote the above programs in assembly, there would be no UB, and no optimizations.
C++ and Rust employ a more “high-level” view of memory and pointers, restricting the programmer for the benefit of optimizations.
When formally describing what the programmer may and may not do in these languages, as we have seen, the model of pointers as integers falls apart, so we have to look for something else.
This is another example of using a “virtual machine” that’s different from the real machine for specification purposes, which is an idea <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html">I have blogged about before</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple proposal (in fact, this is the model of pointers used in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00703441/document">CompCert</a> and my <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2017/07/08/rustbelt.html">RustBelt work</a>, and it is also how <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">miri</a> implements <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/fefe81605d6111faa8dbb3635ab2c51d59de740a/src/librustc/mir/interpret/mod.rs#L121-L124">pointers</a>):
A pointer is a pair of some kind of ID uniquely identifying the <em>allocation</em>, and an <em>offset</em> into the allocation.
If we defined this in Rust, we might write</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Pointer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>alloc_id</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
    <span>offset</span><span>:</span> <span>isize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding/subtracting an integer to/from a pointer just acts on the offset, and can thus never leave the allocation.
Subtracting a pointer from another is only allowed when both point to the same allocation (matching <a href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n4140/expr.add#6">C++</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It turns out (and miri shows) that this model can get us very far.
We always remember which allocation a pointer points to, so we can differentiate a pointer “one past the end” of one allocation from a pointer to the beginning of another allocation.
That’s how miri can detect that our second example (with <code>&amp;x[8]</code>) is UB.</p>

<h2 id="the-model-falls-apart">The Model Falls Apart</h2>

<p>In this model, pointers are not integers, but they are at least simple.
However, this simple model starts to fall apart once you consider pointer-integer casts.
In miri, casting a pointer to an integer does not actually do anything, we now just have an integer variable (i.e., its <em>type</em> says it is an integer) whose <em>value</em> is a pointer (i.e., an allocation-offset pair).
However, multiplying that “integer” by 2 leads to an error, because it is entirely unclear what it means to multiply such an abstract pointer by 2.</p>

<p>I should clarify that this is <em>not</em> a good solution when defining language semantics.
It works fine for an interpreter though.
It is the most lazy thing to do, and we do it because it is not clear what else to do (other than not supporting these casts at all – but this way, miri can run more programs):
In our abstract machine, there just is no single coherent “address space” that all allocations live in, that we could use to map every pointer to a distinct integer.
Every allocation is just identified by an (unobservable) ID.
We could now start to enrich this model with extra data like a base address for each allocation, and somehow use that when casting an integer back to a pointer… but that’s where it gets really complicated, and anyway discussing such a model is not the point of this post.
The point it to discuss the <em>need</em> for such a model.
If you are interested, I suggest you read <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7Estevez/papers/KHM+15.pdf">this paper</a> that explores the above idea of adding a base address.</p>

<p>Long story short, pointer-integer casts are messy and hard to define formally when also considering optimizations like we discussed above.
There is a conflict between the high-level view that is required to enable optimizations, and the low-level view that is required to explain casting a pointer to an integer and back.
We mostly just ignore the problem in miri and opportunistically do as much as we can, given the simple model we are working with.
A full definition of a language like C++ or Rust of course cannot take this shortcut, it has to explain what really happens here.
To my knowledge, no satisfying solution exists, but academic research is <a href="http://sf.snu.ac.kr/publications/llvmtwin.pdf">getting closer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This was by no means meant to be an exhaustive list of academic research on C in general. I do not know of other work that focuses directly on the interplay of integer-pointer casts and optimizations, but other noteworthy work on formalizing C includes <a href="https://github.com/kframework/c-semantics">KCC</a>, <a href="https://robbertkrebbers.nl/thesis.html">Robbert Krebber’s PhD thesis</a> and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus/">Cerberus</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<p>This is why pointers are not simple, either.</p>

<h2 id="from-pointers-to-bytes">From Pointers to Bytes</h2>

<p>I hope I made a convincing argument that integers are not the only data one has to consider when formally specifying low-level languages such as C++ or (the unsafe parts of) Rust.
However, this means that a simple operation like loading a byte from memory cannot just return a <code>u8</code>.
Imagine we <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/rlibc/blob/defb486e765846417a8e73329e8c5196f1dca49a/src/lib.rs#L39">implement <code>memcpy</code></a> by loading (in turn) every byte of the source into some local variable <code>v</code>, and then storing it to the target.
What if that byte is part of a pointer?  When a pointer is a pair of allocation and offset, what is its first byte?
We have to …</p></article></div>

                    <p>WireGuard is pretty great!</p><p>You might have noticed the buzz around <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> lately.
WireGuard is a very simple VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography, and the buzz comes from both the fact that it’s simple and good at what it does, and the fact that it’s so good that it’s going to be included in the Linux kernel by default.
Linus Torvalds himself said that <a href="http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2018/08/02/124">he loves it</a>, which took the software world by storm, as we weren’t aware that Linus was capable of love or any emotion other than perkele.</p>
<p>The only problem I’ve found with WireGuard is a lack of documentation, or rather a lack of documentation where you expect it.
The <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/">quickstart</a> guide, the first thing I look at, mentions a configuration file that it never tells you how to write, and it also assumes you’re more familiar with networking than I am.</p>
<p>Since the initial conditions at the creation of the universe set things up so WireGuard would eventually be underdocumented, I am going against Creation itself and showing you how to easily configure and run it.
Let’s <!-- break -->begin!</p>
<h2>Short overview</h2>
<div><p><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/guard-small.jpg"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" title="Photo from https://unsplash.com/photos/kyzycTfdIRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i></i></a></p><p><span>A guard that looks kinda wiry, and makes sure you don't subconsciously find this post dry and boring.</span></p></div><p>At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another.
It doesn’t really let you access other computers on either end of the network, or forward all your traffic through the VPN server, or anything like that.
It just connects two computers, directly, quickly and securely.</p>
<p>To do anything other than that, you’ll need to configure your network for it, which is “out of scope” for the WireGuard docs, but which I consider very much in the scope of a VPN.
Luckily, WireGuard comes with a helper script, <code>wg-quick</code>, which will do pretty much everything the average user needs.
Keep in mind that the configuration files for <code>wg-quick</code> aren’t compatible with the <code>wg</code> executable, but <code>wg-quick</code> is all we’ll need, so that shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Let’s start setting everything up.</p>
<h2>Installation and setup</h2>
<p>To install WireGuard, see <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">the installation</a> page, it should be a pretty simple process.
After you’ve installed it, you will need to generate a private and a public key for each computer you want accessing the VPN.
Due to WireGuard’s design, both computers on either end of a connection will need to have each other’s public key.</p>
<p>Let’s generate these keys. On each of the computers that will be in the VPN, create the directory <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and run these commands <em>on each of the computers</em> in the directory you just created:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ <span>umask</span> <span>077</span>  <span># This makes sure credentials don't leak in a race condition.</span>
$ wg genkey <span>|</span> tee privatekey <span>|</span> wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</pre></div>
<p>This will generate two files, <code>privatekey</code> and <code>publickey</code> on each of the computers.
The <code>publickey</code> file is for telling the world, the <code>privatekey</code> file is secret and should stay on the computer it was generated on.
You need to paste the contents of these files in the config file, I’m afraid WireGuard doesn’t support referencing them by path yet.</p>
<p>If your VPN server is behind a NAT, you’ll also need to open a UDP port of your choosing (<code>51820</code> by default).
Do this for any computer you want to connect <em>to</em> (computers that you’ll connect <em>from</em> don’t need a port open, as far as I know, but correct me if I’m wrong).</p>
<h2>Common scenarios</h2>
<p>After you’ve done the above, you’re ready to configure WireGuard.
Go to <code>/etc/wireguard/</code> and create a file called <code>wg0.conf</code> on each of your computers.
We’ll go over some common scenarions along with the configuration for each.</p>
<h3>Just a single connection</h3>
<p>If you just want a single connection between two computers (say, to connect your laptop to your home server), the configuration is pretty simple.
On the server, enter the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.1</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>51820</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2/32</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That’s all you need for the server.
Keep in mind that <code>&lt;server's privatekey&gt;</code> is your home server’s <code>privatekey</code> file’s contents (<strong>not</strong> the path to the file, the actual <strong>contents</strong>, a long line of gibberish), and <code>&lt;client's publickey&gt;</code> is similarly the contents of your laptop’s <code>publickey</code> file.</p>
<p>For the client, here’s the configuration:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24</span>

<span># This is for if you're behind a NAT and</span>
<span># want the connection to be kept alive.</span>
<span>PersistentKeepalive</span> <span>=</span> <span>25</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, replace the keys with the appropriate strings you generated.</p>
<p>As you can see, the addresses I picked for each computer are <code>192.168.2.1</code> and <code>192.168.2.2</code>, because that subnet was free in my setup.
If there’s an interface with that subnet on either computer, you should pick another one, such as <code>192.168.3.x</code>, to avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>After writing the two files, run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> on the server and then on the client.
The two machines should now be connected if you entered the server’s IP in the config and configured the port correctly, and you should be able to <code>ping 192.168.2.1</code> from the VPN client and see the responses.
To close the connection again, just run <code>wg-quick down wg0</code>.</p>
<p>I repeat that <em>this setup only lets you access the server’s interface from the client</em>, it won’t forward any of your traffic over the server or let you access any other machines on the server’s LAN.</p>
<h3>Accessing your home LAN</h3>
<p>To actually access the server’s LAN, you’ll need to make a slight modification to the configuration.
On the server’s config file, at the end of the the <code>[Interface]</code> section, add these two lines:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PostUp</span>   <span>=</span> <span>iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
<span>PostDown</span> <span>=</span> <span>iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This assumes that your LAN interface is called <code>eth0</code>.
If it isn’t, change the lines above to the actual name.</p>
<p>On the client, add your LAN’s subnet under <code>AllowedIPs</code>.
For example, if your subnet is <code>192.168.1.x</code>, change <code>AllowedIPs</code> to look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Briefly, the <code>AllowedIPs</code> setting acts as <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing">a routing table when sending, and an ACL when receiving</a>.
When a peer tries to send a packet to an IP, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code>, and if the IP appears in the list, it will send it through the WireGuard interface.
When it receives a packet over the interface, it will check <code>AllowedIPs</code> again, and if the packet’s source address is not in the list, it will be dropped.</p>
<p>You might need to enable IP forwarding on the server for this to work, but it’s a simple process for Linux. <a href="http://www.ducea.com/2006/08/01/how-to-enable-ip-forwarding-in-linux/">Here’s a good guide</a>. If you’re running an OS X or Windows server, you don’t deserve nice things.</p>
<p>Then run <code>wg-quick up wg0</code> as above, and you should be able to ping the other computers in the LAN from the client, as if you were home.
Try <code>ping 192.168.1.1</code> or any other computer in your LAN to verify.</p>
<p>Do note that <em>this won’t forward any other traffic</em> through your server, so it won’t proxy your web browsing or anything like that.
It will just let you talk to other machines on your server’s LAN.</p>
<p>For traffic forwarding, see below:</p>
<h3>Forwarding all your traffic through</h3>
<p>If you want to forward <em>all</em> your traffic through the VPN, WireGuard can easily do that as well.
Keep in mind that, if you’re doing this to avoid ISP tracking, it won’t work against your server’s ISP.
All your traffic will just look like it’s coming from your server, but if that’s at your house, all your torrents and porn downloading is just going to look like it’s coming from there, even though you’re at a net cafe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>To forward all the traffic through, simply change the <code>AllowedIPs</code> line on the client to this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here’s the entire client config again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>[Interface]</span>
<span>Address</span> <span>=</span> <span>192.168.2.2</span>
<span>PrivateKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;client's privatekey&gt;</span>
<span>ListenPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>21841</span>

<span>[Peer]</span>
<span>PublicKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's publickey&gt;</span>
<span>Endpoint</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;server's ip&gt;:51820</span>
<span>AllowedIPs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.0.0.0/0, ::/0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will make the <code>wg0</code> interface responsible for routing all IP addresses (hence the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>), and should route all your traffic over your server.
You can check by loading one of the <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">what is my IP</a> websites and seeing that your server’s IP is what’s detected.</p>
<h2>Securing and running on startup</h2>
<p>After you’re done, run the following to make the directory and files readable only by administrators (it <em>does</em> contain secret keys, after all):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo chown -R root:root /etc/wireguard/
$ sudo chmod -R og-rwx /etc/wireguard/*
</pre></div>
<p>After you’ve created and secured the file, you can easily set WireGuard to initialize the VPN on startup if your OS is using <code>systemd</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl <span>enable</span> wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to start or stop the service:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0.service
$ sudo systemctl stop wg-quick@wg0.service
</pre></div>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>I hope this has been useful!
It’s the guide I wish existed before I spent three hours trying to configure WireGuard, and hopefully you can just copy the configs and have it work right away.</p>
<p>If you need the configuration for IPv6, I’m afraid you’re going to have to experiment yourself, as my ISP does not support it, but feel free to let me know what should be added and I can amend the article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I'm taking a break from debugging books to talk about a calamitous shitshow of textbook writing: <i>Mastering C Pointers: Tools for Programming Power</i>, by Robert J. Traister.
</p>

<p>
I learned of the book through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SUkrR7ZfTA">talk</a> by Brian Kernighan where he refers to the book as probably “the worst C programming textbook ever written.”<span>[<a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a>]</span>
He doesn't name it but <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1003411102791692288">with some help</a> I was able to track down his obliquely accurate reference.
</p>

<p>
This book has become my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20whale">white whale</a>.
Since I started reading debugging books, and especially now that I'm digging through older ones, I find bits of advice that simply don't work today.
While some of it could be construed as useless or idiotic, I've always found the authors come from a position of earnestness, attempting to draw the best conclusions based on decent principles and what they knew at the time they wrote it.
In some cases they may not have known much, but they're honestly and humbly trying to impart some wisdom.
</p>

<p>
When Kernighan put up the following example, I saw what seemed to be the opposite of that.
</p>

<pre>char *combine(s, t)
char *s, *t;
{

      int x, y;
      char r[100];

      strcpy(r, s);
      y = strlen(r);
      for (x = y; *t != '\0'; ++x)
           r[x] = *t++;

      r[x] = '\0';

      return(r);

}
</pre>

<p>
This program (formatting preserved) is taken from the first edition of the book (p.146).
It's horrific (Kernighan calls it “malpractice”).
It does not exhibit the genuineness I have seen with, say, books from the late 1970s on how to debug BASIC programs.
I didn't know what it was.
Deceit?
Laziness?
Unremitting ignorance?
What is the mindset of someone who writes this, presumably thinking it's a good idea?
Can the whole book be that bad?
Kernighan said it was.
I had to know.
</p>

<p>
The book has two editions: the first was published in 1990, the second in 1993.
The fact that there are two editions piqued my curiosity even more.
It sold enough to make another version?
Is that horrible example corrected?
I obtained a copy of each and read them.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the book is pointless.
Kernighan was right: it's garbage.
And the second edition only makes things worse.
Teaching from either one would be a breach of ethics.
If you follow Traister’s coding practices, even adjusted for today's standards, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to create defects and vicious, latent bugs.
A subtly pernicious aspect of the book is the casual tone of the writing.
It’s informal enough that if you don’t really know much about C what he says sort of makes sense, despite the sloppy terminology and mixed, inaccurate metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Any trained programmer will recognize the lessons as worthless.
His terminology is all over the map and typically inaccurate, if not plainly wrong.
Expressions “return a value.”
Values are “handed” into locations.
Constants are “written directly into the program.”
A union is a “specialized pointer.”
The terminology isn’t even consistent.
Micro-optimizations are stressed at all times, and program efficiency is valued over comprehension.
He can’t even define a pointer correctly: “A pointer is a special variable that returns the address of a memory location.”
It does not take long to realize Traister has no idea what he’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Although I’m not going to go over the content (that would take far too long since there’s nothing redeeming there), I did take extensive notes.
You can <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/notes.html">read them</a>, if you are so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I must, however, take a moment to single out the code.
It is universally bad and much of it is simply wrong.
(Imagine trying to learn programming principles from a book that contains a large number of programs that don’t even compile.)
I’ve <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/1/code.html">transcribed</a> some of the programs and annotated them with comments so that you can get a taste of how inept Traister is as a C programmer.
One thing to keep in mind (both for the programs and the notes) is that C89/C90 was new at the time and that the code was written on (and for) MS-DOS systems of the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Things were a bit different then.
</p>

<p>
Enough about the material.
I want to explore the question of how something so wrong even got written.  It’s not that everything in the book is wrong, but it feels like when it’s right, it’s right by accident.
</p>

<p>
Traister has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-J.-Traister/e/B001H6UPHY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1529540256&amp;sr=1-1">written</a> other books, some about electronics and some about programming, one called <i>Going from BASIC to C</i>.
In <i>Mastering C Pointers</i>, he talks about a product he created called CBREEZE that converts BASIC code to C.
Throughout the book he makes passing, roundabout references to BASIC and uses terminology that suggests he’s written a lot of BASIC code.
For example, there is a whole chapter on using pointers to access memory, where reading and writing memory is instead called “peeking” and “poking”, based on the PEEK and POKE instructions in BASIC.
He also says that it took him a couple of tries to learn C coming from BASIC.
In short, I’m convinced he’s knowledgeable about BASIC and has worked on writing software for small, electronic devices.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important?
As I read the book (and if you read my notes, you know where this is going) I started to notice something in the wording and tone.
The further I progressed the more I became convinced of it, and I think it explains how he managed to mangle the explanation of C pointers so badly.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think he understands the call stack.
</p>

<p>
My argument for this interpretation requires a little knowledge of BASIC and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
With BASIC, the key thing to know about most implementations at the time is that there were no functions and no scope aside from the global scope.<span>[<a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a>]</span>
The closest thing to a function in BASIC is the GOSUB command.
The GOSUB command jumps to a line and executes code until it gets to a RETURN statement, where control is transferred back to the line following the GOSUB command.
Within a GOSUB you can jump somewhere else with another GOSUB.
The control follows a stack principle, but no arguments are passed.
GOSUB routines are a way to factor out common code, but that common code has to work on global variables.
(And yes, it’s as terrible as it sounds.)
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the case of simple electronic devices.
Even today some embedded devices, usually programmed using C, do not have a call stack that dynamically allocates space for automatic variables.
There simply isn’t enough memory for it.
Instead, the compiler lays out memory such that each function’s local variables have fixed memory addresses (a “compiled stack” model).
The only stack you have is for return addresses and it is probably handled in hardware.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you’re used to writing BASIC for small memory electronic devices and you learn about C.
You read about pointers and realize something: it’s possible to write a subroutine that can change variables <i>without knowing their names</i>.
It’s manna from heaven!
You don’t have to devote global variables to being the “parameters” of your subroutines anymore.
Life is great.
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset I think Traister had and never got past.
In the book there is one fleeting mention of the stack in reference to excessive (automatic) memory allocation.
(On MS-DOS, if the space for local variables is too large in the program, it might not compile.)
He consistently describes variables as having “exclusive” addresses in the program.
His writing about pointers suggests that he thinks, for each function, space is set aside to hold the local variables for the duration of the program, but you can only access them when inside the function in which they were declared.
So pointers are really powerful because you can provide this address to another function and it can change the value using only a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence for his lack of understanding is that he frequently cites ridiculous space micro-optimizations within functions, such as avoiding the use of integers for index variables, if possible.
Another one, mentioned often, is local <code>char</code> arrays that have a fixed size.
There are good reasons to not use them but his are not among them.
His admonishment is that they waste space.
Technically, that is true, but they don't exist until they're on the stack.
And he never talks about global or file variables.
He only refers to locals with “exclusive” addresses “set aside” for variables.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation runs into some problems once you start asking how functions with malloc will work, but it's worth pointing out that there is almost no discussion about memory management.
In a book devoted to C pointers, that's a toxic mix of gross negligence and incompetence.
There is literally one short paragraph devoted to talking about the <code>free</code> function—and it's characterized as a “side note.”
</p>

<p>
Another sticking point in this interpretation is Traister’s incomprehensible approach to writing functions that take a variable number of arguments.
He does this by passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function (the first being the number of arguments) and accessing them using offsets from the address of the first argument.
This suggests he has some idea about parameters being passed in a dynamic fashion, but it is so spectacularly wrong<span>[<a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a>]</span> you’re left wondering if he even tried his programs out before publishing them.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, this is the most generous interpretation of the text I could come up with, and it still paints a terrible picture.
Occam's Razor suggests that Traister is just clueless.
But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01l1WIC9mBo">analyzing a terrible movie</a> that somehow gets made, it's more fun to reason through the “behind the scenes” parts.
</p>

<p>
Given the ineptness of the book, you'd think it was self-published.
You would be wrong.
It was published through Academic Press, which was a division of Harcourt, Brace &amp; World at the time, but is now an “imprint of Elsevier.”
</p>

<p>
In the preface of the second edition it says that the first edition was reviewed “by a professional C programmer hired by the publisher.”
That programmer said it should not be published.
That programmer was right, but the publisher went ahead and …</p></div></div>

You can't even appreciate animal onesies?</figcaption></figure><p>The reason to write about this Twitter drama is pretty simple: Culture matters. As I've pointed out before, that's why <a href="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/multiplayer-psychosis/">everyone gets so worked up</a>. It would be ludicrous to claim that conceptions of <em>coolness</em> don't have real-world effects; I can attest that my own street cred has been hugely advantageous, and I am by no means a big deal.</p><p>If we want to <a href="https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/">build the awesome future directly</a>, we need to point out who is a pernicious influence, who focuses on tearing others down rather than building them up — <em>especially</em> if they amass clout by doing so, then use it to initiate a negativity flywheel. Personally I can excuse moderate and occasional bitchiness (including from myself), but not the devoted focus of @VCBrags.</p><p>And yes, there should be reputational consequences for this behavior. Nobody needs to be fired, I'm not advocating for that, but bad-faith critics of the tech industry and those who work in it should be identified and ignored. After all, we genuinely do want to grow and improve! Meekly accepting malice, versus insisting on constructive feedback, undermines that effort.</p><p>So let's talk about Pasquale, this story's <em>enfant terrible</em>. It may be a tad confusing if you didn't see the saga unfold on Twitter — I won't recap every detail, but you can get up to speed here:</p><figure><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/09/01/the-enduring-mystery-around-an-anonymous-twitter-account-that-infuriated-techs-kingpins-and-nearly-ruined-a-founders-reputation/#4879f4d8548d"><div><p>The Enduring Mystery Around An Anonymous Twitter Account That Infuriated Tech’s Kingpins—And Nearly Ruined A Founder’s Reputation</p><p>By lampooning venture capitalists, @VCBrags accumulated an audience that included billionaires Jack Dorsey and Mark Cuban—and enmity from many of the people it skewered.</p><p><img src="https://i.forbesimg.com/48X48-F.png"><span>Abram Brown</span><span>Forbes</span></p></div><p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat(jpg)/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5f4dbdc61f01affb0ae14e3e%2F0x0.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>That post is <em>mostly</em> accurate. Intriguingly, however, Forbes editor Abram Brown reported that Gumroad CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1298122211656523776">Sahil Lavingia</a> "still maintains he does know @VCBrags' true identity but declined to comment further and did not fully reveal his suspicions in his Twitter post." I gotta wonder how thoroughly Brown conducted his research:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 600w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/content/images/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-09-03-at-5.29.41-PM.png 1174w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Sahil Lavingia Retweeted" — I followed along for 🍿 reasons and a full-time Forbes journalist missed what I noticed.

<p>This was originally supposed to be a blog post about <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>. I wanted to write a longer essay about Basecamp’s new email tool and test if the app actually lives up to its hype.</p>



<p>After playing around with it for a few weeks, my conclusion is this: <strong>Hey’s most interesting aspect is not its radical approach to email – but its fresh approach to note taking!</strong></p>



<p>We have long treated notes as a distinct silo in our productivity stack, when we should have integrated them right into our workflows instead. While email might need an overhaul, I see a way bigger opportunity in rethinking digital note taking.</p>



<p>So instead of my Hey review, let’s talk about notes and my idea for a radically new kind of note taking app.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A Closer Look at Notes in Hey</p>



<p>Hey has two interesting notes features.</p>



<p>The first are so-called <a href="https://hey.com/features/thread-notes/">Thread Notes</a>. These are basically emails to yourself within an email thread that only you can see. You might have seen similar internal notes features in shared inbox tools like Zendesk or Front. Thread Notes in Hey are effectively the single player version of those.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/threadnotes.png"></p><p>I’d find Thread Notes super useful in combination with snoozed emails: <em>“Show me this email again in [insert time] and remind me of [insert note]”</em></p>



<p>This feels like a way better workflow than adding a note in a separate reminder, to-do, CRM, or note taking app.</p>



<p>a) Because there’s no need for context/app switching.<br>b) You might not even remember that you took a note related to an email when it resurfaces in your inbox a few weeks later.</p>



<p>To-do and reminder apps (and calendars!) work great for tasks that are tied to a specific day or time. But many tasks – and especially notes – are not dependent on time. Their relevance is based on other trigger points. Only when certain conditions are met, should these notes resurface: <em>“If [insert event] is true, then show [note]”</em></p>



<p>In the case of our email, the note becomes relevant in <em>[insert snooze time]</em> or whenever the recipient replies to the email thread. The fact that many tasks have external dependencies (which are usually linked to an email thread)  is one of the reasons I believe that your email inbox should also be the place where you manage your to-dos. <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/">You shouldn’t need a separate to-do app</a>.</p>



<center>—</center>



<p>The second note feature in Hey are <a href="https://hey.com/features/inbox-notes/">Inbox Notes</a>.</p>



<p>As the name suggests, these notes are added to individual emails in your inbox. Similar to Thread Notes, you can use them to quickly jot down things you need to remember, but they also help you to highlight specific emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/inboxnotesimp.png"></p><p>Thread Notes and Inbox Notes feel similar, but they serve two slightly different use cases. Thread Notes work more like reminders (<em>“Don’t forget X when you reply”</em>), whereas Inbox Notes feel more like bookmarks that highlight the most important messages in a long list of emails. </p>



<p>Together, they remind me of one of my all-time favorite note taking tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_Note">Post-it Notes</a>.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Post-it Notes</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of physical note taking and there are two writing tools that I use every single day: A physical notebook (for longer thoughts, including first drafts of my blog posts) and post-it notes (for all kinds of quick notes).</p>



<p>(Disclaimer: When I say “post-it notes” I’m referring to all types of sticky notes, not just those sold by 3M.)</p>



<p>Post-it notes serve two of the same functions that Hey’s note features offer: highlights and reminders.</p>



<p>One of the reasons I still read a lot of non-fiction in physical book form is because it’s easier to bookmark and annotate passages that I quickly want to find again later. Similar to Thread Notes, sticky note bookmarks help me <strong>highlight</strong> the most important items in a long list.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postithighlight-1.png"></p><p>Apart from helping you find important passages in a book later on, sticky note bookmarks also allow you to add additional context to the section you highlighted (e.g. *why* you bookmarked a particular section or thoughts you had about it). </p>



<p>You could write down notes like this in a separate notebook, but then you’d lose the connection to the source they are based on. <strong>What makes post-it notes so interesting is the spatial relationship between the notes and their respective context.</strong></p>



<p>It’s this spatial relationship that also make post-it notes great <strong>reminders</strong>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/postitreminders.png"></p><p>Post-it note reminders are similar to Hey’s Thread Notes in that they are triggered not based on time but on events that don’t have a (forecastable) deadline. They are essentially like notifications that appear when you look at specific objects.</p>



<p>A post-it note on your front door, for example, is like a notification that pops up when you’re about to leave the house: <em>“Before you go, don’t forget to [insert note]”</em>. A shopping list on your fridge is a data request notification that surfaces when you are most likely to have new items to add to your list.</p>



<p>Together, post-its essentially become a notes layer that augments the real world. Instead of a physical notebook that lists all your notes and tasks in chronological order, post-it notes are scattered around your house but tied to specific places or objects where they are most relevant.</p>



<p>The question is: <strong>Why isn’t there a digital note taking tool that works like this?</strong></p>



<p><span>04</span> A Spatial Note Taking Layer</p>



<p>There are dozens of great note taking apps out there: Evernote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Workflowy, Notion, Roam … the list goes on and on. Every one of these tools has its own unique angle on note taking, but they all have one thing in common: They are stand-alone apps.</p>



<p>This strikes me as suboptimal. Neither the creation nor the consumption of notes should be treated as separate workflows.</p>



<p>As John Palmer points out in his brilliant posts on <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialinterfaces/">Spatial Interfaces</a> and <a href="https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware">Spatial Software</a>, “Humans are spatial creatures [who] experience most of life in relation to space”. Post-it notes are so powerful because they have a spatial relationship to their context.</p>



<p>Many notes shouldn’t live in a dedicated note taking app that you explicitly have to open and search. Notes should emerge automatically whenever and *wherever* they are most relevant.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/statusquonotes-1.png"></p><p>As long as note taking remains separated, users constantly have to switch back and forth between different applications, which is not ideal. It reminds me of <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">the recent discussion around productivity and collaboration</a> – which have historically also been treated as two separate, isolated workflows:</p>



<p><i>The platonic flow of productivity should minimize time spent not productive, with collaboration as aligned and unblocking with that flow as possible. By definition, any app that requires you to switch out of your productivity app to collaborate is blocking and cannot be maximally aligned. It’s fine to leave your productivity app for exceptions and breaks. But not ideal when working.</i></p>



<p>The same applies to notes. You shouldn’t have to switch apps and context to take or consume notes. It should stay within the same workflow!</p>



<p>(Side Note: You could argue that note taking is essentially single-player collaboration where you communicate with your future self – but that’s a whole new discussion I’ll save for another blog post.)</p>



<p>Natively built in note taking features like email notes in Hey feel like a good step in the right direction – but email is just one distinct silo in your productivity stack. Imagine you had to buy different sets of post-it notes for every single room or object in your house.</p>



<p>What we need instead is a spatial meta layer for notes on the OS-level that lives across all apps and workflows. This would allow you to instantly take notes without having to switch context. Even better yet, the notes would automatically resurface whenever you revisit the digital location you left them at.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/noteslayer-1.png"></p><p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>



<p><span>05</span> Examples</p>



<p>One use case that immediately came to mind when I thought about spatial notes is bookmarking.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t use just one bookmarking app for everything. We use different bookmarking apps or bookmarking features depending on the type of object we want to save for later: Podcasts are usually saved in a dedicated podcast app, for example. Articles are bookmarked in Pocket, books on Goodreads, songs on Spotify, places on Foursquare, products on Amazon … you get my point.</p>



<p>Bookmarks are great to remember *what* you want to revisit later – but not *why* you saved something in the first place. I would love to be able to add notes to my bookmarks directly in each app so that I have some context on why these objects are important when I return to them later.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/podcastnote.png"></p><p>Ideally, these notes wouldn’t just show up in the one place I originally left them, but across all apps and websites that reference the (semantic) object I bookmarked. A note attached to a book I want to read in Goodreads, for example, should also emerge when I see that book in my Amazon search results – or when someone mentions it in my Twitter timeline.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/goodamznnotes.png"></p><p>People are a similar type of semantic object you could tie notes to. Instead of a stand-alone CRM tool, you would leave a note attached to a person straight from your current workflow (e.g. your email client). That note would then automatically re-surface whenever the person it references becomes relevant again:</p>



<ul><li>When you’re in an email thread with them</li><li>When you add them to a calendar event</li><li>When you’re visiting their LinkedIn page</li><li>When you look them up in your phone book</li><li>etc</li></ul>



<center>—</center>



<p>Another use case for spatial notes are instructions on how to use specific software features or improve workflows. These could be quick reminders to add permissions to new calendar events or to use Filtered Views in Google Sheets. You could also use these notes to train users on keyboard shortcuts.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/relief.png"></p><p>You could imagine employers shipping corporate laptops with pre-installed notes to make it easier to transfer (previously tacit) knowledge and thus improve the onboarding process for new hires.</p>



<p><span>06</span> Closing Notes</p>



<p>I could go on and on …</p></div></div>

<p>This summer I participated in Google Summer of Code 2020 at PostgreSQL Global Development Group. During these 3 months, I was working on performance and safety features for <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g">WAL-G</a> utility. I went through this summer journey together with my mentors <a href="https://github.com/g0djan">Georgy Rylov</a> and <a href="https://github.com/x4m">Andrey Borodin</a>. In this post, I will mainly focus on the work done during the program.</p>



<p>WAL-G is a tool written in Go for backing up and restoring PostgreSQL clusters (most recently MySQL, MongoDB, and FoundationDB too). It supports Amazon S3 storages (and S3 compatible analogs, like Yandex Object Storage), as well as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Swift Object Storage, and the file system.</p>



<p>In its core functionality, WAL-G is a successor of WAL-E but written in Go. WAL-G works much faster than WAL-E and also has some new cool features, one of them is delta-backups. Delta-backup, whenever possible, stores only pages, changed since the previous backup. When a full recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last base backup plus all of the delta<em> </em>backups until the point of restoration.</p>



<p>The goal of the project was to make two enhancements:</p>



<p>The first one was to improve the performance of the backup fetch process by implementing delta-backups unpacking in reverse order to avoid rewriting the same pages along with the following backup structure reorganization to avoid downloading unnecessary files.</p>



<p>The second was to provide users with the features to verify backup consistency, such as WAL’s history consistency check and page checksum verification.</p>



<p>These two enhancements were implemented as four features:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#unpackreverse">Unpack delta-backups in reverse order</a></li><li><a href="#reorganizebackup">Reorganize backup structure to avoid downloading unnecessary files</a></li><li><a href="#walhistorycheck">WAL’s history consistency check</a></li><li><a href="#checksumverification">Page checksum verification</a></li></ul>



<p>All of the four features by now are merged into WAL-G master branch. You can try them by cloning the<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g"> WAL-G repo</a>.</p>



<h2 id="unpackreverse">Unpacking delta backups in reverse order</h2>



<p>When restoring from delta backup, WAL-G at first unpacks the oldest version of the page files from base backup and then applies delta backups to the base version in historical order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CSh90AC62ojlPE7uCv0Ms2xl-buHF--mp3qZ8mb6bCGeK3V7D-S_92aaOTHFBI0h6NuAZ6fCci8DdV__6_kwh2sfVrYGsYSE1FAdWhCiHO-HxV9rygxaJXR112AuT9ERexCQkMYt" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G default backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>The problem is that there are page blocks in the older backup which are going to be completely overwritten by their version from the newer backup, thus resulting in unnecessary writes to disk. The main goal of this feature was to improve backup fetch performance by implementing an unpack of delta backups in reverse order:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WEyTQyTvj1VzFKlSO4Jd2FQW_xofm2TBKxnHXSyY7AN94SDPFDppYL6E7J4F7QFspmLTqoFIrSVJlGIdPT99aNOV0ABgiRoNPjAmH7upqLWHy6xE5JHB3KDnDjkbEeppyAXFRzvF" alt=""><figcaption>Reverse backups unpack order</figcaption></figure>



<p>With this approach, pages are written to the disk only once, which noticeably improves backup restore performance. The main idea was to create page files from the latest delta backup at first, then fill the missing information from the following delta backups and the base backup.</p>



<p>The following text describes how WAL-G creates the page file without unnecessary page overwrites. It will focus on the most non-trivial case when the page file was modified multiple times since the first appearance in the base backup. Other more trivial cases are omitted for briefness. The page file is restored using the following scheme:</p>



<ol><li>Create page file from delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the previous delta</li><li>…</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the first delta</li><li>Fill the missing information by applying the base backup</li></ol>



<h4>Create page file from delta</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/G3T7fENlEHMmJUn327j1rAPyO_dzHDMYj8b7UCi5fVuTs1r_BCiO2lADT4feALN5NHdeD28F5XBVFdi5_2GQwrPqS5IRw4jpzA-T5V6EBYUwoXGwqxi0NwJDl5Y1OjQLc_RBBRmd" alt=""><figcaption>WAL-G increment file header</figcaption></figure>



<p>WAL-G uses the information from the header of the delta page file to extract the final size of the page file. Knowing the final size of the page file and the PostgreSQL page size, it is possible to calculate the page count needed to write on the disk. For each page WAL-G performs the following algorithm to write the pagefile:</p>



<ol><li>If this page exists in delta backup, write it to the page file</li><li>If this page does not exist in the delta, write an empty page block to the page file</li></ol>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ov865hrbNync4w4GYeICfb4qU2q4elCY5xetoJ2fglJgSjORdAPW_ywlJmHJE2t3LXjhxFheOkZ-BKnBWkQGs8YcoogD9E-dR8aZS55TyIJq-4O9DBkW9RjTvq9VSRzwfwYi25ij" alt="" width="372" height="249"><figcaption>Structure of the created page file</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the N-th delta to the page file</h4>



<p>For each next delta, WAL-G needs to write only the missing information to the page files. For each page in N-th delta backup WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the page from delta</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qraIB_-HykTegsB2Hkuhf1GsyCcL_p8PWXYwQKzKeWC1zAQBaXA0jxa6t2WcKBycDR3zG51BZhdMBftYucTB0XB3QfXnCL9JT36FlrW9uUvV-a1zv7D6ujxt0NFKGwNvwOpdwoQq" alt=""><figcaption>Application of N-th delta to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Apply the base backup to the page file</h4>



<p>After WAL-G reached the base backup, it needs to get the missing pages from the base backup page file version. For each page in the local page file WAL-G does the following:</p>



<ol><li>If there is already some version of this page on the disk, then it is the latest and we can ignore the base backup page</li><li>If this page doesn’t exist on the disk (empty block in a page file) then WAL-G writes it</li></ol>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9lBoXoMFN54cDWH9GCyXVgz4k_VxHYG6xAhmude06gNmTrVF7tLHzIHOgXwNIXSJ3jgwuXjM8P4FjK9JraZSjOtdLC4J2U1Nkf_P7nvuU-dJJN35FsZqAITcr9NrTxBDTICWh7t_" alt=""><figcaption>Application of base backup to file on the disk</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve implemented the proposed approach and measured performance improvement. WAL-G with reverse delta unpack turned on demonstrated about 2.5x faster backup restore compared to the standard WAL-G. If you are interested in more details, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/benchmarks/reverse-delta-unpack-26-03-2020.md">complete benchmark report</a>.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>



<p>To use the reverse delta unpack, do one of the following:</p>



<ul><li>set the&nbsp;<code>WALG_USE_REVERSE_UNPACK</code> environment variable</li><li>add the <code>--reverse-unpack</code> flag:</li></ul>



<pre><code>wal-g backup-fetch /path LATEST --reverse-unpack</code></pre>

<h2 id="reorganizebackup">Reorganization of backup structure</h2>



<p>After the implementation of the reverse delta unpack feature disk load and overall performance during backup-fetch<strong> </strong>has been greatly reduced. Nevertheless, WAL-G still needed to download absolutely all backup files from the cloud. However, with the reverse delta unpack feature implemented it wasn’t longer necessary – for example, there may have been a situation when WAL-G already had a consistent local version (no missing page blocks) of each file in the archive that was going to be downloaded. In this case, the archive contained only outdated files that aren’t useful anyway, so WAL-G can skip the download of the entire archive and proceed to the next one. The goal was to avoid downloading these unnecessary archives from the cloud and improve the WAL-G backup fetch performance even more 🙂</p>



<p>WAL-G stores each backup in the cloud split into several compressed archives. The problem is that to check which files exist in the archive you need to download and decompress it from the storage. The main idea is quite simple – store the contents of each archive in a backup JSON sentinel file so WAL-G can skip the archives without interesting files without downloading them.</p>



<pre><code>{ // this is a sample backup sentinel JSON file 
  "PgVersion": 120002,
  "UncompressedSize": 500781396,
  "CompressedSize": 100243768,
  "LSN": 17448304680,
  "DeltaCount": 8,
  "DeltaFromLSN": 16743661608,
  "SystemIdentifier": 6847498813832237599,
  "DeltaFullName": "base_00000003000000030000002F",
  "TarFileSets": { // new field to store information of contents of each tar archive here
    "part_001.tar.lz4": [
      "/",
      "/base",
      "/base/1",
      "/base/13689",
      "/base/13690",
      "/base/16384",
      "/base/16384/1259",
      "/base/16384/16397",
...
    ],
    "part_003.tar.lz4": [
      "tablespace_map",
      "backup_label"
    ]
  },
  "Files": {...},
  "DeltaFrom": "base_0000000300000003000000E6_D_0000000300000003000000D6",
  "FinishLSN": 17448304952,
  "Spec": null
}</code></pre>



<p>We’ve successfully implemented this approach and now WAL-G stores the contents of each backup archive in backup sentinel JSON by default. However, with this approach, the case when all of the files in the archive can be skipped may be quite rare. For a file that is being updated frequently, there is a high chance that some delta backup will contain only outdated information about it that WAL-G won’t need. And vice versa, if some file is being updated rarely, there is a high chance that delta backup will still hold some required data so we can’t skip the archive containing this file and we need to download the entire archive.</p>



<p>That’s why we developed an additional backup creation mode (<code><code>rating composer</code></code>) based on file update ratings. The idea was to place the files with a similar update frequency in the same archives so we can get the higher chance of the entire archive to be skipped. WAL-G needed to somehow determine the update frequency for each file in the database cluster folder. Luckily, for paged files, there is information from Postgres statistics collector – particularly <code>n_tup_ins</code>, <code>n_tup_del</code>, <code>n_tup_upd</code> columns from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> view.</p>







<p>In the rating composer mode, during backup creation, for each file WAL-G calculates the updates count using the data from <code>pg_stat_all_tables</code> and stores it in the current backup sentinel JSON. If available, WAL-G also reads the <code>previousUpdatesCount</code> – previous updates count value from the previous backup sentinel JSON. Using these values WAL-G then calculates the <code>updateRating</code> for each file: <code>(currentUpdatesCount * 100) / previousUpdatesCount</code>. Finally, all that left to do is:</p>



<ol><li>Sort all the files in the current backup by their <code>updateRating</code></li><li>Start packing files into archive from the file with the highest update rating</li><li>When the size of the files packed in the current archive exceeds the <code>WALG_TAR_SIZE_THRESHOLD</code> limit, create the new archive, and go to step 2.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, seems like we’re done… But actually no. To speed up things a little bit, WAL-G can do concurrent packing of multiple tar archives during backup creation (<code>WALG_UPLOAD_DISK_CONCURRENCY</code> setting). If you look closely, the above algorithm can’t be parallelized in straightforward …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The complexity of cloud costs keeps increasing - When we were building PlanForCloud in 2012 AWS had just hit 10,000 different pricing points for their services - now there are over 300,000.</p>
<p>We found existing tools fit in too late in the process and are not aimed at the people in control of the infrastructure. It’s difficult to get cost estimations when you are building and deploying your services, which often leads to bill shock and no easy way to track down these costs. So we wanted to build a CLI tool that can plug into your existing development and operations processes and bring cost visibility to the engineers.</p>
<p>Currently Infracost supports AWS and Terraform, but we will add support for more cloud vendors (GCP, Azure) and other IaC tools (Pulumi).</p>
<p>We also want to go beyond just the baseline costs of infrastructure - data transfer costs and other usage-based costs can often be a significant portion of a cloud bill, and are also the hardest to predict and track down. If you have any ideas about the best way to handle these then please <a href="https://twitter.com/aliscott" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reach out to me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://fastpages.fast.ai/images/copied_from_nb/fastcore_imgs/td.png" alt="screenshot with code"></p>
<p>I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills:  I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques.  I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn't seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it.  I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find!  That's when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests?  I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what I did over the past month!  I'm pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I've ever experienced.  I've discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also <em>why the code works the way it does</em>, and to explore edge cases while writing tests.  Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible!  It turns out the library I choose, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> is a library on top of which many <a href="https://github.com/fastai">fast.ai</a> projects are built on. Most importantly, <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/">fastcore</a> extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I'm going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python.  My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python:</strong>  I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer.  From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work.   Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell.  Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages.</li>
<li><strong>You get a new set of pragmatic tools</strong>: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems.</li>
<li><strong>Learn more about the Python programming language:</strong>  Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process.  For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Making-**kwargs-transparent">Making **kwargs transparent<a href="#Making-**kwargs-transparent"> </a></h2><p>Whenever I see a function that has the argument <strong>**kwargs</strong>, I cringe a little.  This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that <code>foo</code> also accepts and additional parameters <code>b</code> and <code>d</code>.  We can fix this with <code>delegates</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can customize the behavior of this decorator.  For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping <code>**kwargs</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude arguments.  For example, we exclude argument <code>d</code> from delegation:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also delegate between classes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes">Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes<a href="#Avoid-boilerplate-when-setting-instance-attributes"> </a></h2><p>Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in <code>__init__</code>?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Ouch! That was painful.  Look at all the repeated variable names.  Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class?  Not Anymore!  Checkout <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">store_attr</a>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can also exclude certain attributes:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>There are many more ways of customizing and using <code>store_attr</code> than I highlighted here.  Check out <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#store_attr">the docs</a> for more detail.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate">Avoiding subclassing boilerplate<a href="#Avoiding-subclassing-boilerplate"> </a></h2><p>One thing I hate about python is the <code>__super__().__init__()</code> boilerplate associated with subclassing.  For example:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#PrePostInitMeta">PrePostInitMeta</a>.  We define a new class called <code>NewParent</code> that is a wrapper around the <code>ParentClass</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Type-Dispatch">Type Dispatch<a href="#Type-Dispatch"> </a></h2><p>Type dispatch, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">Multiple dispatch</a>, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives.  This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia.  For example, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch#Julia">conceptual example</a> of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with asteroid hitting spaceship</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Asteroid</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting asteroid</span>

<span>collide_with</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>::</span><span>Spaceship</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> 
<span># deal with spaceship hitting spaceship</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box.  Fortunately, there is the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html#typedispatch-Decorator">@typedispatch</a> decorator to the rescue.  This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function <code>f</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/dispatch.html">you can read about here</a>. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin/multipledispatch">multipledispatch</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin">Mathhew Rocklin</a> (the creator of Dask).</p>
<p>After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p><code>functools.partial</code> is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= <code>val</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can create a new function out of this function using <code>partial</code> that sets the default value to 5:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One problem with <code>partial</code> is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Composition-of-functions">Composition of functions<a href="#Composition-of-functions"> </a></h2><p>A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result.  This is especially useful when applying various data transformations.  Consider a toy example where I have three functions:  (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>But why is this useful?  You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>arrsum</span><span>(</span><span>add2</span><span>(</span><span>filter5</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>])))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You are not wrong!  However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>For more information about <code>compose</code>, read <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#compose">the docs</a>.</p>
<hr>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="A-more-useful-__repr__">A more useful <code>__repr__</code><a href="#A-more-useful-__repr__"> </a></h2><p>In python, <code>__repr__</code> helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging.  Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using <code>store_attr</code>, which was discussed earlier).</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can use <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#basic_repr">basic_repr</a> to quickly give us a more sensible default:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator">Monkey Patching With A Decorator<a href="#Monkey-Patching-With-A-Decorator"> </a></h2><p>It can be convenient to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/">monkey patch</a> with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing.  We can use the <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#patch">decorator @patch</a> from <code>fastcore.foundation</code> along with type hints like so:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now, <code>MyClass</code> has an additional method named <code>func</code>:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Still not convinced?  I'll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<hr>
<h2 id="A-better-pathlib.Path">A better pathlib.Path<a href="#A-better-pathlib.Path"> </a></h2><p>When you see <a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">these extensions</a> to pathlib.path you won't ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Path.readlines</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.readlines()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.read</code>: same as <code>with open('somefile', 'r') as f: f.read()</code></li>
<li><code>Path.save</code>: saves file as pickle</li>
<li><code>Path.load</code>: loads pickle file</li>
<li><code>Path.ls</code>: shows the contents of the path as a list. </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fastcore.fast.ai/utils.html#Extensions-to-Pathlib.Path">Read more about this here</a>.  Here is a demonstration of <code>ls</code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Wait!  What's going on here?  We just imported <code>pathlib.Path</code> - why are we getting this new functionality?  Thats because we imported the <code>fastcore.foundation</code> module, which patches this module via the <code>@patch</code> decorator discussed earlier.  Just to drive the point home on why the <code>@patch</code> decorator is useful, I'll go ahead and add another method to <code>Path</code> right now:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>That is magical, right?  I know!  That's why I'm writing about it!</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>

<h2 id="An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas">An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas<a href="#An-Even-More-Concise-Way-To-Create-Lambdas"> </a></h2><p><code>Self</code>, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object.  For example, let's create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>You can use <code>Self</code> in the same way:</p>

<p>This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment.</p>

<h2 id="A-Drop-In-Replacement-For-List">A Drop-In Replacement For List<a href="#A-Drop-In-Replacement-For-List"> </a></h2><p>You might be pretty happy with Python's <code>list</code>.  This is one of those situations that you don't know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you.  Enter <code>L</code>, a list like object with many extra goodies.</p>
<p>The best way I can describe <code>L</code> is to pretend that <code>list</code> and <code>numpy</code> had a pretty baby:</p>

<p>The above QR code contains a complete Windows executable that will run on Windows 7 and up. It's a simple but fully playable implementation of Snake.</p>
<p>A QR code is a data storage medium like any other, and while it's almost always used to store ASCII text, it can also be used to store binary data. As such, virtually any computer data can theoretically be stored in a QR code provided it can fit within the size limitations.</p>
<p>A QR code comes in various standard sizes, the largest being version 40 which can store up to 2,953 bytes (roughly 2.9 KB) of binary data. The above code is not quite that large, it's only storing around 1.4 KB of data (shrunk down from 3.2 KB with <a href="http://www.crinkler.net/" target="_blank">Crinkler</a>, slightly larger than the executable shown in the video because I decided to add a little more functionality).</p>

<p><b>Method 1: Webcam (automatic)</b></p>
<p>You can treat this QR code much like a QR code in the real world by using your computer's webcam to read it (e.g. after loading this page on a phone or printing the QR code out). For this, I recommend using zbarcam. I've included a download link with everything you need:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open "Read Snake From QR.bat". After a moment, your webcam will activate.</li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and Snake will appear, freshly read from the QR code.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Method 2: Webcam (manual)</b></p>
<p>This method is the same as the above, however if you'd rather input the commands manually than running my script, go for it:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/zbarcam.zip">Download zbarcam</a></li>
    <li>Open Command Prompt</li>
    <li><span>cd</span> to the zbarcam folder.</li>
    <li>Run the following command:
        <p>zbarcam --raw --oneshot -Sbinary &gt; snake.exe</p>
        <p>The arguments used are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>--raw</span> - Disables any character encoding conversion.</li>
            <li><span>--oneshot</span> - Stops reading and closes zbarcam after the code has been successfully read.</li>
            <li><span>-Sbinary</span> - Informs zbarcam that the data in the code is binary data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using either your phone screen or a print-out, hold the QR code up to the camera.</li>
    <li>Once it recognizes the code, it will close and an executable called "snake.exe" will appear in the same folder.</li>
    <li>Open "snake.exe".</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been patched to correctly output binary data on Windows. This project exposed a bug in zbarcam where binary data was incorrectly treated as text, inadvertently corrupting it as Windows attempted to convert LF line endings to CRLF. The fix used here has since been merged into zbar's master source code, but as of July 2020 no stable release version has included the fix yet.</li>
    <li>The version of zbarcam provided above has been compiled with DirectShow support for greater compatibility with webcam devices. In my video, I use a build that has not been compiled for DirectShow (using VfW instead) which leads to a black and white webcam feed. This build provides a feed in color.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a proof-of-concept, I wrote an implementation of Snake in JavaScript that, when minified, could also fit into the maximum QR code size which I briefly showcased in the video. Some people were interested in playing this, so <a href="https://itsmattkc.com/etc/snakeqr/snake-minified.html">it is available here</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm stepping down from Rust's core team. It's my last official involvement with Rust, and I'm kinda sad about leaving. Rust is exciting and important, and I love the community and technology. It has been a joy and an education to work with the core team; they are good people.</p><p>I stopped working full-time on Rust early in 2019 when I left Mozilla. I have been contributing as part of my work at PingCAP (big thank you for that support!) and in my own time, but have had much less time for the work than it deserves. My wife and I are expecting a second daughter any day now, and I think that will nuke my remaining spare time, and any availability I have left for Rust work. Good timing for me to make space on the core team, and to focus on my databases/distributed systems work.</p><p>I hope to remain active in the community, and hopefully next year, once things have settled down a bit at home, I can again contribute regularly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.ncameron.org/blog/content/images/2020/09/99312bc3-a432-415b-8366-9ad1eefd47bb.JPG" alt="Ultrasound image of my daughter"><figcaption>My next project, pre-launch</figcaption></figure>

			<h4><em>Dean Scarff</em> on bringing AI to climbing grades</h4>



<p>It’s some time in The Future; the bushfire smoke has cleared, you’re out of coronavirus lockdown and you’re psyched to finally climb outdoors again. Flicking through the guidebook you spot it; a climb that’s at your grade, and it’s even got two stars. The onsight awaits.</p>



<p>Several hours later you’re thrutching up a section of the route that feels like it must be at least two grades harder than what the guidebook claimed. The only hope for your ego is that you’re collateral damage from a 1970s interstate sandbagging contest. If only you could have stumbled on a recently-bolted softie that climbs like a gym route instead!</p>



<p>In Australia we’re blessed with the best grading system in the world courtesy of the legendary John Ewbank.&nbsp; Ewbank used whole number grades, which took into account a range of factors. These numbers put climbs in order: you can expect a grade 20 will be harder than a grade 19, and so on.</p>



<p>Yet even with this system, we rely on the opinions of first ascensionists and guidebook editors for fair grading. These opinions can be warped by grade inflation, quirky styles and intentional sandbagging. Another problem arises when trying to do maths with grade numbers. Normally we can add 1 to a whole number to get the next whole number, but there’s nothing consistent and measurable that’s equivalent to adding 1 to the grade of a route.</p>



<p>What if there was a way to quantify which routes were soft or sandbagged, some measure that reflected the experience of many climbers? Well, obviously you’d use it to find something soft to tick and impress your friends, right?!</p>



<h3><strong>FIGURE IT OUT FOR YOURSELF</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine you’re seeking glory and wander into an unfamiliar crag without a guidebook. Your mate, who can redpoint most 19s but has been working several grade 21 projects for months, proceeds to flash a route.&nbsp; You guess it’s grade 19 or lower. If your mate dogged it instead, you might guess it’s above grade 19. The more climbers of different skill levels trying the route, the more information you have to pinpoint the grade.</p>



<p>But what if you don’t know how hard everyone else climbs to start with?&nbsp; That’s fine, you can watch for climbers who are taking roughly the same number of attempts as you to send particular routes. When it’s your turn on the next route, you can guess that you’ll take the same number of attempts as they did.</p>



<p>This is the basis for a scientific grading system. Instead of using people’s opinions about how hard routes are, you observe the actual outcomes of the ascents. To put a single number on how difficult a climb is, you can use the odds that you’ll send it.</p>



<h3><strong>THE CHESS GAME</strong></h3>



<p>Last year, on weekends I couldn’t climb, I investigated how far I could take these ideas. I drew inspiration from what may seem like a surprising source: the world of boardgame player ratings. Games like chess have ratings systems for ranking professional players, and I figured this could be applied to climbing.</p>



<p>These ratings systems are grounded in probability theory: the current ratings of two players can be used to calculate odds on the outcome of a game. The difference in ratings can be transformed to a probability using the ‘logistic function’, an S-shaped curve. If players have the same rating (0 difference), the odds are even. As the difference between the players’ ratings gets bigger, the probability the favourite wins gets closer to 100%. These systems allow for the ratings to be adjusted: after a game, the winner’s rating is adjusted up, and the loser’s rating is adjusted down.</p>

<p>I applied the same function for climbing. Every ascent is like a chess game, but one of the players is the rock itself. We can also make some other assumptions: it’s unlikely that climbers make big improvements overnight, and the longer it’s been since a climber has logged any climbing, the less certain we can be about their current performance level. All these statements about ‘what’s likely’ can be combined into a single statistical model. Based on this model, I built software that picks the best climber and route ratings to fit with a list of ticks.</p>



<p>All I needed now was data. To start with I just used my friends’ logbooks, which let me sanity-check the software I’d written. But with so many routes, the model needed more data to narrow down grades. So I made contact with <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="theCrag.com (opens in a new tab)">theCrag.com</a>, an online guidebook and logbook website. The team from theCrag gave me access to the hundreds of thousands of ascents records available from the platform, which I used to validate and refine the model.</p>



<p>We were stoked with the results of running theCrag’s users’ logbooks through my program. In most cases, the estimated grades are similar to guidebook grades, so the model is able to calculate a reasonable grade without anyone’s opinion as input. It’s also good at putting odds on clean ascents: adding 1 to a grade has a real meaning in terms of the odds someone can send a route. These are the theoretical improvements over conventional grading.</p>



<p>However, the real gold is where the model results and the guidebook disagree. For some routes, particularly rarely repeated ones, this seems to be due to a lack of data: the clean first ascent belies many hours of working a project. But in many cases climbers’ online accusations of soft or sandbagged grading were agreeing with the model. I’d found what I’d been looking for, and soon enough my friends were asking for recommendations of soft routes at the next grade.</p>



<p>There are still many opportunities for improvement. How good the estimated grades are depends a lot on the ascent data. Picking the right grades relies on climbers logging all their ascents online, even their hangdogs. And there are lots of other factors that are currently left out of the model to keep it simple, such as the effect of particular styles, reachy moves, knowing the beta and broken holds.</p>



<p>For me, working on this project was an opportunity to combine two of my hobbies (climbing and programming), while also making something for the climbing community. I’ve made the open source estimation software available for <a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings">fr</a><a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="e (opens in a new tab)">e</a><a href="https://github.com/p00ya/climbing_ratings">e</a>, and I’ve also published an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">academic paper</a> detailing the theory and performance of the model. I’m also very grateful for the willingness of Simon Dale and his team at theCrag.com to work together.</p>



<p>As for the revised grades, a first version of them <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/">has been</a><a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="  (opens in a new tab)"> </a><a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/routes/assert/has-floating-grade/">incorporated into route listings on theCrag.com</a> – you can see it listed amongst the Grade Citations under the name grAId (a play on the word ‘grade’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence’). </p>

<p>The team from theCrag is currently working on having the grAId continuously adjusted as new data becomes available, to complement their existing CPR system.</p>

<p>As an addendum on to our four-part look at the general structures of the farming of cereal grains (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">IV</a>) this post is going to briefly discuss some of the key ways that the structures of <strong><em>rice</em> <em>farming </em></strong>differ from the structures of wheat and barley farming.  We’ll start with some of the key differences in the mechanics of rice farming itself, before moving into how those differences might motivate different social and economic organization in the countryside, before finally discussing some of the theories as to how rice farming might – or might not – impact larger structures like the state.</p>

<p>(Quick bibliographic aside: I relied primary for this on Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (206 B.C. – A.D. 220) (1980) and F. Bray, <em>The Rice Economies: Technology and Development in Asian Societies </em>(1986) which were recommended to me by specialists in the field.  The latter is a wealth of technical details on rice cultivation, although it is as focused on the transition to mechanization and modern agriculture as to the conditions of pre-modern rice cultivation.)</p>



<h2>Rice Cultivation</h2>



<p>We want to start with the rice cultivation process.  There are a <em>lot</em> of varieties of rice out there, but the key divide we want to make early is between dry-rice and wet-rice.  When we’re talking about ‘rice cultures’ or ‘rice agriculture,’ generally, we mean wet-rice farming, where the rice is partially submerged during its growing.  Wild rice, as far as we can tell, began as a swamp-grass and thus likes to have quite a lot of water around, although precisely controlling the water availability can lead the rice to be a lot more productive than it would be in its natural habitat.  While there are varieties of rice which can be (and are) farmed ‘dry’ (that is, in unflooded fields much like wheat and barley are farmed), the vast majority of rice farming is ‘wet.’  As with grains, this is not merely a matter of different methods of farming, but of different varieties of rice that have been adapted to that farming; varieties of dry-rice and wet-rice have been selectively bred over millennia to perform best in those environments.</p>



<p>Wet-rice is farmed in paddies, small fields (often <em>very</em> small – some Chinese agronomists write that the ideal size for an individual rice field is around 0.1 hectare, which is just 0.24 acres) surrounded by low ‘bunds’ (small earthwork walls or dykes) to keep in the water, typically around two feet high.  Because controlling the water level is crucial, rice paddies must be very precisely flat, leading to even relatively gentle slopes often being terraced to create a series of flat fields.  Each of these rice paddies (and there will be many because they are so small) are then connected by irrigation canals which channel and control the water in what is often a quite complex system.</p>

<p>The exact timing of rice production is more complex than wheat because a single paddy often sees two crops in a year and the exact planting times vary between areas;  one common cycle on the Yangtze is for a February planting (with a June harvest) followed by a June planting (with a November harvest).  In other areas, paddies planted with rice during the first planting might be drained and sown with a different plant entirely (sometimes including wheat) in the intervening time.</p>



<p>The cycle runs thusly: after the heavy rains of the monsoons (if available), the field is tilled (or plowed, but as we’ll see, manual tillage is often more common).  The seed is then sown (or transplanted) and the field is, using the irrigation system, lightly flooded, so that the young seedlings grow in standing water.  Sometimes the seed is initially planted in a dedicated seed-bed and then transferred to the field, rather than being sown there directly; doing so has a positive impact on yields, but is substantially more labor intensive.  The water level is raised as the plant grows; agian this is labor intensive, but increases yields.  Just before the harvest the fields are drained out and allowed to dry out, before the crop is harvested and then goes into processing.</p>



<p>Rice is threshed much like grain (more often manually threshed and generally not threshed with flails) to release the seeds, the individual rice grains, from the plant.  That is going to free the endosperm of the speed, along with a hull around it and a layer of bran between the two.  Hulling was traditionally done by hand-pounding, which frees the seed from the hull, leaving just the endosperm and some of the bran; this is how you get <em>brown</em> rice, which is essentially ‘whole-grain’ rice.  While it is generally less <em>tasty</em>, the bran actually has quite a lot of nutrients not present in the calorie-rich endosperm.  Whereas <em>white rice</em> is produced by then milling or polishing away the bran to produce a pure, white kernal of the endosperm; it is very tasty, but lacks many of the vitamins that brown rice has.</p>



<p>Consequently, while a diet of mostly brown rice can be healthy, a diet overwhelmingly of <em>white rice</em> leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine_deficiency">Thiamine deficiency</a>, known colloquially as <em>beriberi</em>.  My impression from the literature is that this wasn’t as much an issue prior to the introduction of mechanical milling processes for rice. Mechanical milling made producing white rice in quantity cheap and so it came to dominate the diet to the exclusion of brown rice, producing negative health effects for the poor who could not afford to supplement their rice-and-millet diet with other foods, or for soldiers whose ration was in rice.  But prior to that mechanical milling, brown rice was all that was available for the poor, which in turn meant less Thiamine deficiency among the lower classes of society.</p>



<h2>Farmer Terrain</h2>



<p>Because rice is such a different crop than wheat or barley, there are a lot of differences in the way that rice cultivation shapes the countryside.  We’ll move here from the relatively direct impacts on the organization of farmers and then discuss the more speculative impacts on the organization of whole societies.</p>



<p>The thing to note about <strong>rice is that it is both <em>much</em> more productive on a per-acre basis than wheat or barley, but also <em>much</em> more labor intensive</strong>; it also relies on different forms of capital to be productive.  Whole-grain wheat and brown rice have similar calorie and nutritional value (brown rice is somewhat better in most categories) on a unit-weight basis (so, per pound or ton), but the yield difference is fairly large: rice is typically around (very roughly) 50% more productive per acre than wheat.  Moreover, rice plants have a more favorable ratio of seeds-to-plants, meaning that the demand to put away seeds for the next harvest is easier – whereas crop-to-seed ratios on pre-modern wheat range from 3:1 to 10:1, rice can achieve figures as high as 100:1.  As a result, not only is the gross yield higher (that is, more tons of seed per field) but a lower percentage of that seed has to be saved for the next planting.</p>

Of particular note is how small each individual field is (compare the village on the right-hand side!).</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the same time, the irrigation demands for effective production of wet-rice requires a <em>lot</em> of labor to build and maintain</strong>.  Fields need to be flooded and drained; in some cases (particularly pre-modern terrace farming) this may involve moving the water manually, in buckets, from lower fields to higher ones.  Irrigation canals connecting paddies can make this job somewhat easier, as can bucket-lifts (there’s a picture of a simple one below), but that still demands moving quite a lot of water.  In any irrigation system, the bunds need to be maintained and the water level carefully controlled, with also involves potentially quite a lot of labor.</p>



<p>The consequence of all of this is that while the rice farming household seems to be roughly the same size as the wheat-farming household (that is, an extended family unit of variable size, but typically around 8 or so members), <strong>the farm is much smaller</strong>, with common household farm sizes, even in the modern period, clustering around 1 hectare (2.47 acres) in comparison to the standard household wheat farms clustered around 4-6 acres (which, you may note with the yield figures above, lands us right back at around the same subsistence standard).</p>



<p>Moreover, rice cultivation is less soil dependent (but more water dependent) because wet-rice farming both encourages nitrogen fixation in the soil (maintaining the fertility of it generally without expensive manure use) and because rice farming leads naturally to a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podzol">pozdolisation</a>, slowly converting the underlying soil over a few years to a set of characteristics which are more favorable for more rice cultivation.  So whereas with wheat cultivation, where you often have clumps of marginal land (soil that is too wet, too dry, too rocky, too acidic, too uneven, too heavily forested, and so on), rice cultivation tends to be able to make use of almost any land where there is sufficient water (although terracing may be needed to level out the land).  The reliance on the rice itself to ‘terraform’ its own fields does mean that new rice fields tended to under-produce for the first few years.</p>

<p>The medieval toilet or latrine, then called a privy or garderobe, was a primitive affair, but in a castle, one might find a little more comfort and certainly a great deal more design effort than had been invested elsewhere. Practicality, privacy, and efficient waste disposal were all considered and, even today, one of the most prominent and easily identifiable features of ruined medieval castles is the latrines which protrude from their exterior walls.</p>
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>Medieval toilets, just as today, were often referred to by a euphemism, the most common being 'privy chamber', just 'privy' or 'garderobe'. Other names included the ‘draught’, ‘gong’, ‘siege-house’, ‘neccessarium’, and even ‘Golden Tower’. Garderobe later came to mean wardrobe in French, but its original meaning was likely just any small cupboard or room and, as space was at a premium in a castle, the toilets were never any bigger than absolutely necessary.</p>

<h3>Exteriors</h3>
<p>The toilets of a castle were usually built into the walls so that they projected out on corbels and any waste fell below and into the castle moat. Even better, waste went directly into a river as is the case of the latrines of one of the large stone halls at <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Chepstow_Castle/">Chepstow Castle</a> in Wales, built from the 11th century CE. Some castles, such as the 11th-century CE Corfe Castle in Dorset, England had latrine shafts emptying directly in the courtyard or bailey while still others hung conveniently over a cliff face, as at Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, England, built in 1176-1777 CE.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;Coity&nbsp;Castle in Wales, there were three tiers of toilets with the shafts emptying into the same courtyard basement.</p>
<p>The protruding shaft of masonry that made up the toilet was buttressed from below or might nestle in the junction between a tower and <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/wall/">wall</a>. Some waste shafts were short while others reached almost to the ground. In the latter case, that might prove a dangerous design feature if there were a siege of the castle. Indeed, besiegers used just such a latrine shaft in 1203-4 CE to gain entry to Chateau Gaillard on the River Seine in France, built by Richard I (r. 1189-99 CE) at the end of the 12th century CE. After the siege, to ensure no repeat of the trick, a masonry wall was built around the shaft exit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another design was to have tiers of toilets on the outside wall where the shafts all sent waste to the same collection point. <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Dover_Castle/">Dover Castle</a>, built in the second half of the 11th century CE, had a cesspit at the base of one wall of the keep to collect waste from the toilets above. At Coity Castle in Wales, built in the 12th century CE, there were three tiers of toilets with the shafts emptying into the same courtyard basement. The same arrangement was found at Langley Castle in Northumberland, England, built c. 1350 CE, with the common collection point being a pit which was cleaned out by a natural stream. There were also toilets in ground floor buildings and these had stone drainage channels to drain away waste. Waste from such collection points, or the ditch in general,&nbsp;was likely collected by local farmers to be reused as fertiliser. When castles became larger and more comfortable from the 14th century CE, so the number of conveniences increased. Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, England, for example, had no fewer than 28 toilets emptying out into its moat.</p>

<h3>Interiors</h3>
<p>Viewed from the interior, the toilet was set back in a recess or within a mural chamber (a passage within a wall) but not all were given the luxury of a wooden door. A short narrow passageway sometimes led to a toilet, often with a right-angle turn for greater privacy. Pairs of toilets, separated by a wall, were not uncommon and these might share the same waste chute. The chamber of the castle’s lord often had a private latrine but even he had, like everyone else, a chamber pot if needed. The castle’s priest might also be one of the lucky few to have an <em>en-suite</em> toilet for his own chamber, as at Northampton Castle, England, built in the late 11th century CE. Another sure place to find a castle toilet was in the corner of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Great_Hall/">Great Hall</a> where audiences and banquets were held.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The toilet seat was made of a wooden bench covering the shaft hole in the masonry. The wood was usually cut with a rectangular or keyhole aperture. Hay, grass, or even moss were used as toilet paper. Toilet hay is referred to by medieval writers, albeit indirectly. Jocelin de Brakelond, the 12th-century CE English monk, recounted the story that a fire had almost broken out in the Abbey of Bury St. Edmonds when a candle had burned dangerously close to the hay in one of the abbey’s privies.</p>
<p>Some toilets had a window to let in fresh air, which for the same reason was not shuttered like other windows of a castle. The floor may have been scattered with rushes and aromatic herbs and flowers, just as the Great Hall of the castle was, to deter vermin and offer a more pleasant fragrance than the users could provide. Walls were sometimes whitewashed with a coating of lime-plaster which maximised the light coming from the small window and because lime kills off bacteria.</p>

</a>
</figure>
<p>The toilet was cleaned either by a simple bucket of water thrown down the shaft or by diverting the wastewater from the kitchen sinks. More rarely, rainwater was diverted from gutters above the latrine which might also be collected into a cistern and then periodically opened to flush the toilet shaft. Despite these&nbsp;refinements, there can be no doubt that a castle toilet stank to high heaven. Indeed, it was not uncommon to hang clothing near latrines as the pungent ammonia fumes helped to kill mites. <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Henry_III_of_England/">Henry III of England</a> (r. 1216-1272 CE) famously made mention of the problem of unsavoury odours in a letter to one of his castle constables, ordering a no-expense-spared refit of the amenities of the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Tower_of_London/">Tower of London</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the privy chamber…in London is situated in an undue and improper place, wherefore it smells badly, we command you on the faith and love by which you are bounden to us that you in no wise omit to cause another privy chamber to be made…in such more fitting and proper place that you may select there, even though it should cost a hundred pounds, so that it may be made before the feast of the Translation of Saint Edward, before we come thither. (Gies, 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Urinals</h3>
<p>Triangular urinals were built into some tower walls so that defenders did not have to leave their post for very long. An example is to be found in the mural passage at Orford Castle in Suffolk, England, built in the second half of the 12th century CE. It seems that even such basic human activities were considered by architects to provide the best possible defence of the castle against all comers in all situations. Intriguingly, at Castle Rising in Norfolk, England, built in the mid-12th century CE, there are two toilets next to each other but in separate rooms, one with a toilet and one with a urinal which might perhaps be evidence of a separation of the sexes.&nbsp;</p> </article><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
				<p>When it comes to modern web application development, MongoDB is the king. If you are a full stack programmer, you hear about MERN or MEAN stacks every day. The <b>M</b> is in every one of them and it stands for MongoDB. The free and open source community version of MongoDB powers a large number of Web applications. From its humble beginnings in 2007, MongoDB has come a long way. It is the primary product behind the company MongoDB Inc. with over 10 billion dollars in market capitalisation. Like many other products before and after, online advertising was the key catalyst behind the vision and development of MongoDB. The story of MongoDB is an interesting one and in this article, I will take you on a journey through the MongoDB land and its history.</p>
<h2>The Idea of the Humongous Database – The Beginnings</h2>
<p>The story of MongoDB has its beginnings much earlier than 2007. In 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Merriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Merriman</a> and Kevin O’Connor created the famous online advertising company DoubleClick. Kevin Ryan joined the team soon after(Dwight and Kevin later cofounded 5 companies together – Gilt, 10gen, Panther Express, ShopWiki and Business Insider). DoubleClick soon took off and within a few years it was serving as much as 400,000 ads/second. Such large scale traffic was not anticipated by the relational database technologies available at that time. Configuring relational databases for such scale also required substantial amount of money and hardware resources. So Dwight(who was the CTO at the time) and his team wrote custom database implementations to scale DoubleClick for the increased traffic. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early talks on MongoDB</a>, Dwight talks about getting a network hardware with serial number 7 and wondering whether it will work! This was even before the invention of load balancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-people.jpg" width="300px" alt="People behind MongoDB" title="People behind MongoDB">In 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Horowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliot Horowitz</a> joined DoubleClick R&amp;D division as a software engineer immediately after his college. Within 2 years he left DoubleClick to start ShopWiki along with Dwight. Both of them realised that they were solving the same horizontal scalability issues again and again. So in 2007, Dwight, Eliot and Kevin Ryan started a new company called 10gen. 10gen was focused on creating a PaaS hosting solution with its own application and database stack. 10gen soon got the attention of the venture capitalist Albert Wenger (Union Square Ventures) and he invested $1.5 million into it. This is what <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2008/07/10gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Wenger wrote in 2008 about the 10gen investment</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen. They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service. The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby. The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Albert was refering to as “the database with interesting design” was in fact MongoDB. Rapid development on the new database was undertaken from 2007 to 2009. The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e73188b5512c82290a4070af4afddac20d0b981e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first commit of the MongoDB database server by Dwight can be seen here</a>. The core engine was written in C++. The database was named MongoDB since the idea was to use it to store and serve humongous amount of data required in typical use cases such as content serving. Initially the team had only 4 engineers(including Dwight and Eliot) and decided to focus just on the MongoDB database instead of the initial PaaS product. The business idea was to release the database as an open source free download and offer commercial support and training services on top of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB 1.0 was released</a> in February 2009. The initial version focused on providing a usable query language with document model, indexing and basic support for replication. It also had experimental version of sharding, but production ready sharding clusters were available only in version 1.6 released a year later.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongodb-user/X0Le3mBel2I/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Dwight responded to a question</a> on the suitability of Mongo for a highly scalable system (MongoDB user group – September 2009),</p>
<blockquote><p>
For horizontal scaling, one would use auto-sharding to build out large MongoDB clusters.  This is in alpha now, but if your project is just getting started, it will be in production by the time you need it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Early MongoDB Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the early years, the basic design principles behind MongoDB development were the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data model for faster programming – document model with CRUD.</li>
<li>Use of familiar language and format – JavaScript/JSON.</li>
<li>Schema less documents for agile iterative development.</li>
<li>Only essential features for faster development and easy scaling. No join, no transactions across collections.</li>
<li>Support easy horizontal scaling and durability/availability (replication/sharding).</li>
</ul>
<p>In his ZendCon 2011 presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOQJpGu1kY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“NoSQL and why we created MongoDB”</a>, Dwight talks about these principles in detail. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=2408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 minutes mark</a>, there is also an interesting discussion on the difference between replication and sharding. As the database server code matured and once MongoDB hit the mainstream, many of these principles were obviously diluted. Latest MongoDB server versions support joining to some extend and since MongoDB 4.2, even distributed transactions are supported!</p>
<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>Before we get into detailed MongoDB history and how it evolved over the years, let us briefly look at what exactly it is!</p>
<p>MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database. It can run on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and the open source version is available as a free download. MongoDB stores data entities in a container called collection and each piece of data stored is in a JSON document format. For example, if a customer submits an online order, the entire details of that order (order number, order line items, delivery address etc.) are kept in a single hierarchical document in JSON format. It is then saved to a collection named “customer_order”.</p>
<p>MongoDB also comes with a console client called MongoDB shell. This is a fully functional JavaScript environment using which you can add, remove, edit or query document data in the database.</p>
<h2>MongoDB Architecture</h2>
<p>The following MongoDB architecture diagram provides a high level view of the major components in the MongoDB server.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-architecture.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB Architecture Diagram" title="MongoDB Architecture Diagram"></p>
<p>MongoDB currently offers <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers for 13 languages</a> including Java, Node.JS, Python, PHP and Swift. The storage engine MMAPv1 is removed since version 4.2. The encrypted storage engine is only supported in the commercial enterprise server.</p>
<p>The beauty of MongoDB is that using the same open source free community server you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a simple single machine instance suitable for most small applications.</li>
<li>Run a multi-machine instance with durability/high availability suitable for most business applications.</li>
<li>Run a large horizontally scaled cluster of machines(shard cluster) handling both very large sets of data and high volume of query traffic. MongoDB provides automatic infrastructure to distribute both data and its processing across machines. A typical use case would be running a popular ad service with thousands of customers and millions of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagrams show various options available for running MongoDB instances.</p>
<h2>Single Server/Fault Tolerant Setup</h2>
<p>For small applications, a single server setup is enough with frequent data backups. For installations that require fault tolerance, a replica set implementation can be done. In the fault tolerant deployment, usually there are 3 or more MongoDB instances. Only one of them work as the primary instance and if it fails, one of the other 2 secondaries takes over as the primary. The data is identical in all instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment1.jpg" width="800px" alt="Single server/fault tolerant setup" title="Single server/fault tolerant setup"></p>
<h2>Shard Cluster for Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>For a large database with both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance requirements, a MongoDB shard cluster is configured. As can be seen from the diagram below, minimum recommended number of machines for a fault tolerant shard cluster is 14! Each fault tolerant replica set in this case handles only a subset of the data. This data partitioning is automatically done by MongoDB engine.<br>
<img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment2.jpg" width="800px" alt="Shard cluster with partitioned data" title="Shard cluster with partitioned data"></p>
<p>When you download the latest version of MongoDB (4.4) and extract it, you will find that it contains only the following 3 main files,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mongo</b> – MongoDB shell for interacting with your server using JavaScript based commands.</li>
<li><b>mongod</b> – The MongoDB main executable. This can run as a single database instance, as a database member of a sharded cluster or as a configuration server of a sharded cluster.</li>
<li><b>mongos</b> – A router application only needed for sharded horizontally scaled cluster of database servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mac machine, the total size of these 3 executables is around 150MB. These are the only components you need for any type of MongoDB deployments! In a world of bloated software, this is a welcome change! This simplicity and elegance is what makes MongoDB so powerful and reliable.</p>
<h2>Evolution of MongoDB (2009 to 2020)</h2>
<p>MongoDB 1.0 was released in February 2009 and it had most of the basic query functionalities. MongoDB 1.2 was released in December 2009 and it introduced large scale data processing using map-reduce. Realising that MongoDB has good potential, 10gen quickly ramped up the team. MongoDB 1.4 (March 2010) introduced background index creation and MongoDB 1.6 (August 2010) introduced some major features such as production ready sharding for horizontal scaling, replica sets with automatic failover and IPv6 support.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-timeline1.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB 2009 to 2013" title="MongoDB 2009 to 2013"></p>
<p>By 2012, 10gen had 100 employees and the company started providing 24/7 support. MongoDB 2.2 release(August 2012) introduced aggregation pipeline enabling multiple data processing steps as a chain of …</p></div></div>

Waves power into the coast, with an almighty force, whilst many surfers await, ready to make the most of the towering water as it breaks. Having spent a lot of my childhood in Cornwall and still returning to this day, I always take the chance to get out on the water.</p><p>Obviously waves are powerful things, but there is more to their power than meets the eyes and I wanted to explore their true power.</p><p>A wave breaks when it wants, it is as powerful as it wants, the wave couldn’t care less if you’re riding it or not. There is no controlling it. It’s just you responding and reacting to the wave. Your reaction is all you can control. This creates a connection, a relationship between you and the water. One that you are a part of, but just to observe and react, all you can do is do your best and the wave will do its own thing. This connection is natural and raw, just you and the elements, nothing else is interfering or interrupting.</p><p>This connection with what’s around you and the earth, as you are riding the wave to the shore, also forms with fellow surfers riding the wave. Enjoying that same moment and experience, unique in many ways.</p><p>Nothing else is in the way or is there to disturb or interrupt you, there is a indisputable focus on the present. As if time is slowing down, watching the colours, ripples and feeling the undercurrent, strength and force of the wave. Lots of this happens subconsciously but this focus on the present can be hard to replicate elsewhere.</p><p>Waves are continuous, if you miss one, another is on the horizon. If you mess it up, then you can try again on the next. You just do your best and keep at it. There is something liberating about the idea you can just try again the next day and that’s ok. No pressure, limit or finiteness.</p><p>The artistic nature of the waves swirling, building and crashing is beautiful to watch, especially up close. It’s as if the movement has emotion, yet is unaware and not caring of what’s in front. As if it has a mind of it’s own.</p><p>The true power of waves is more than just the force of the water then.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, <a href="https://www.mattswain.co.uk/newsletter">sign up to my newsletter </a>for more ideas,  thoughts and insights into thinking without limits. </p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Imagine a computer-based system visualizing your thoughts and secret thoughts; yes, it's possible now by artificial intelligence assistance. Recent advancements in hardware innovation have re-energized technology. It becomes more accurate, authentic, can produce better sound, accurate visualization, and understanding of the location. Outstanding computer processors support computer to make a decision, plan outputs and don't repeat the mistake as they learn from it. The four scientists in Kyoto at Kyoto University did an exceptional experiment that exceeds the global expectations about such a dreamy truth. </p><p>Tomoyasu Horikawa, Guohua Shen, Yukiyasu Kamitani, and Kei Majima recently published their <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf">results in a paper </a>on a scientific research platform &nbsp;BioRxiv. They have done their experiment in ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. Their study mainly exposes the decoding of human thoughts using an artificially intelligent system. &nbsp;The artificial intelligence system becomes so smart and real to duplicate human minds and show what they're thinking in their minds. &nbsp;Now scientists are successful in developing the next phase of AI machine, which uses human psychology. It is a leading technology from science fiction to merely science phenomena.</p><p>Below video is demonstration of Tomoyasu’s work. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrO1v7-KcXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-is-helping-human-beings"><a href="https://thinkml.ai/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-common-people/">Machine Learning is helping human beings</a> </h3><p>Machine learning is in use since many years ago in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. It helped generate a visual impact of human thinking in the form of binary mages or geographic shapes. The images obtained are of simple shapes or pixels. However, another prediction that the human brain thinks in unique patterns of image creation; different thinking levels, either with simple or complex components.</p><p>The idea of processing human thoughts is not new as we can see 1950s videos where doctors used to put contraptions on the human brain. It helps them to decipher the thoughts always running in their patient's minds. A British Serial <strong>Quatermass and the Pit </strong>shows a similar technique to translate the alien's thoughts.</p><p>The scientists from the United States, China, and Japan utilize this fantasy to change it into reality. They use <strong>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </strong>strategy for better measurement of brain activity. The deep neural networks involved in replicating human brain functioning procedure.</p><h3 id="the-emergence-of-artificial-people-with-machine-learning-system">The emergence of Artificial People with Machine Learning System</h3><p>Machines come with consciousness and result in developing a direct relationship between humans and machines. The day is coming when robots not only talk but can laugh, fight, and be cruel with the power of advancement in technology. Some research laboratories are busy making a force that can sense its surrounding environment and show response according to it. They sense human thoughts running in their minds and visualize to others. It's beneficial to know and see the thoughts of those quality people who are extraordinary but can't speak.</p><p>Alan Turing said:</p><blockquote>‘’If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, it is as intelligent as a human being.’’</blockquote><h3 id="is-it-telepathy-or-something-advanced">Is it Telepathy or Something Advanced?</h3><p>The whole world is excited about the news of AI reading minds, but the reality is somewhat not as same as appearing to us. Machine learning is still unable to detect rightly what we think, feel, desire, wish, or need at a specific time. The science is aiming to decipher the images that subjects see for a period. Thus, machine learning uses a reconstruction of a visual filed algorithm for a visual demonstration of thoughts.</p><p>In the last years, scientists strive to create a system that can judge images based on their shapes, characters, and letters when a subject’s mind view them.</p><h3 id="kyoto-university-research-by-four-scientists">Kyoto University Research by Four Scientists</h3><p>The advances in the development of artificial intelligence also use a <strong>deep neural network </strong>to decode human thoughts. &nbsp;They aimed to develop a method that not only deciphers the images but also regenerate the same one. Therefore, the four efficient scientists at Kyoto University utilized the BioRxiv platform and <strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN)</strong> as a proxy to share their findings of thought decoding. These neural systems help decode images of thoughts in the human brain and produce a visual prediction that resembles a person's thinking.</p><p>More generalized; the system should visualize the image about which its system is not trained previously after decoding the thoughts. &nbsp;It can see or covert human thoughts into images.</p><h3 id="how-does-ai-can-visualize-our-thinking-process">How Does AI Can Visualize our Thinking Process? </h3><p>The basis of this system is to scan the human brain deeply. For this purpose, the scientists introduce fMRI (Functional MRI) that scans the brain's core over traditional MRI that involves only monitoring brain activity. The unusual behavior of fMRI is its ability to track <strong>blood flow </strong>to the brain and <strong>brainwaves. </strong></p><p>It takes data from the scan and interprets what the subject was thinking when data was taken from it? The actual decoding occurs in the <strong>complex neural network </strong>that converts data into image format. But the humans have to rain the system first to get-go everything. They train the machine about the human brain thinking strategy that how it works and make a solution. It gets information from blood flow as it tracks blood's path, way, direction, and speed to reach the brain.</p><p>After it, the system starts producing images related to the information it gets by tracking blood flow. The process is only possible if the system comes with multilayers of <strong>deep neural networks. DNN</strong>involves the processing of information in image form. The information is then carried towards <strong>Deep Generator Network (DGN) Algorithm, </strong>which finally creates the image with high precision and accuracy. If we obtain images without using DGN, we can't get a high resolution or clear images of a different thought. DGN captures faces, eyes, and textual patterns and produces high-quality visual clues. With an efficient DGN algorithm, efficiency can be exceeded to 99%, and highly matching decoded images are obtained.</p><h3 id="the-methodology-of-the-experiment-deep-image-reconstruction">The methodology of the Experiment; Deep Image Reconstruction</h3><p>In simple words, the system consists of two necessary steps:</p><p>1. &nbsp;A subject sees an image, and the same image is shown to the AI system; thus, it can recreate its image.<br>2. &nbsp;After it, the subject’s brain thinks about that image, and AI recreates the same image by showing real-time response.</p><p>The scientists selected three subjects and showed them natural geometric shapes, artificial images, and other objects of varying characters. They repeated the same exposure of showing objects in varying periods for almost ten weeks and recorded their brainwaves. In <strong>experiment number one</strong>, they recorded the brain activity of the subject when seeing the particular object out of 25. In contrast, they measured brain activity by hiding the image and asked the brain to think about it (<strong>experiment number 2</strong>). </p><p>In both scenarios, they recorded the image created by artificial intelligence and then compared them to get staggering results. The filtered data is considered as a template of sorts. Then they used a decoder to identify the images via fMRI. They scanned brain activity and used the reverse-engineered method to produce an image of information obtained from thoughts. The scientists enabled <strong>deep learning networks </strong>to understand the brainwaves and decode its information to get output.</p><p>AI is so fast as it has the power of guessing about a particular problem. It asks and answers its questions at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="ai-visualizing-static-thoughts">AI Visualizing Static Thoughts </h3><p>Results were outstanding as the computer reconstructed that image but with low accuracy. The quality of images in both experiments was fizzy and comparatively low in the second experiment case. The reason was that it's difficult for a brain to remember an image as identical as it is. It enables scientists to decode ''hieratical'' images with various colors, pixels, and formations. The system establishes, for instance, can predict a picture of a bird, a plant, or an animal. Technology goes on proceeding towards refinement for better implementation of a particular process. </p><h3 id="statement-of-kamitani-about-the-project">Statement of Kamitani About the Project</h3><p>Kamitani was excited about their mutual hard work and getting mind-blowing results. He talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>as:</p><blockquote>‘’We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person sees just by looking at its brain activity. Our previous method was to suppose that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.''</blockquote><blockquote>'These neural networks or AI models can be used as a proxy for the human brain's hierarchical structure,' he added more. </blockquote><h3 id="ai-decoding-videos-you-re-watching-from-your-brain-activity">AI Decoding Videos You’re Watching from Your Brain Activity</h3><p>There is another group of scientists who published their research on ‘<strong>’Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision’’ </strong>in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>. They developed deep learning algorithms to scan the human brain and its working principles to decode its information.</p><p>Their experiment was based on three women who watched videos of hundreds of unique categories for several hours, and the scientists recorded their brain activity. The videos were on birds, airplanes, and other related objects. They obtained images from a popular Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision. The scientists used a functional MRI machine that measures signals of activity in the visual cortex. As the women watched several clips, the deep learning algorithms predicted activity closely related to the actual brain activity. Dozens of brain parts respond to a specific thought; thus, the artificial system mimics natural brain working strategies and shows visible results. </p><p>It also helped scientists to recognize which part of the cortex is involved in thought …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Dijkstra famously dissed testing by saying “Program testing can be used to show
the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”
As if you should choose one over the other.
I don’t see them as opposites but as complementary techniques that
should both be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of formal verification.
Formal verification tools can be the best bug-finding tools you have
ever used.
And they can completely eliminate entire classes of bugs from your code.
But, formal verification won’t find bugs in your
specification; or in your assumptions about your dependencies; or in your
build/CI harness, etc. (See <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/fonseca:ecs:2017">Fonseca</a> for more examples
of where testing has found bugs in formally verified systems.)</p>

<p>And, we all reluctantly agree that Dijkstra was right: even a thorough,
perfectly executed test plan can miss bugs.</p>

<p>So, for the last few months, I have been trying to have both.
We (my team and I at Google) have been reimplementing Jason Lingle’s
<a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest">proptest</a> property-testing library for use with Rust formal verification tools.
The original proptest lets you write test harnesses to test that your code
(probably) satisfies properties.
Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">a reimplementation of the proptest interface</a>
that enables you to use exactly the same test harnesses to
formally verify that the properties hold.
So far, we have only tried this with the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a>
but our implementation is based on the verification
interface used in <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/">verification competitions</a> so it should be
possible to port our library to many other verification tools.<sup id="fnref:for-Rust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:for-Rust">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[Before I go any further, I should mention that what we are <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">releasing this
week</a> is a very early research prototype.  It is not ready for serious use
and it is definitely not an official, supported Google product.  We are
releasing it now, in its current, immature state because we want to have
a conversation about how programmers want to formally verify Rust code
and we think that it is helpful to have something to push against.
We welcome pull requests that add support for other verifiers, or that
push the design in a better direction.]</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proptest-test-harness">A proptest test harness</h2>

<p>To get an idea for what property testing looks like in <code>proptest</code>,
we’ll look at an example from the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">proptest book</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>proptest!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[test]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>test_add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>1000i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>1000i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
        <span>assert!</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>a</span><span>);</span>
        <span>assert!</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example defines a property called <code>test_add</code> that tests a function called
<code>add</code>.  In particular, it checks that, for non-negative values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the
result of <code>sum(a, b)</code> is at least as large as <code>a</code> and as <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The notation <code>0..1000i32</code> represents the set of all values in the range <code>[0 ..
1000)</code> and the notation <code>a in 0..1000i32</code> says that a value <code>a</code> should be
chosen from that set.</p>

<p>The <code>proptest!</code> macro converts this property into a test function
that repeatedly generates random values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and executes the
body of the property.</p>

<p>(After adding in <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">some additional glue code</a>) we can run this example with the command</p>



<p>which produces the following output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, if we deliberately write a property that doesn’t hold, then <code>cargo test</code>
produces output more like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

---- test_add stdout ----
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'Test failed: assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100; minimal failing input: a = 0, b = 0
        successes: 0
        local rejects: 0
        global rejects: 0
', src/main.rs:7:1


failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="verifying-with-propverify">Verifying with propverify</h2>

<p>Proptest checks the above property by generating random values and testing.
But we can also interpret the property as saying that for all values
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the sets, the body of the property will not panic.
That is, we can interpret it as a universally quantified specification.</p>

<p>To verify the above property, we use a script that compiles the Rust
code, invokes the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a> and filters
the output of KLEE to determine whether there is any choice of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> that can cause the body of the property to panic.</p>



<p>This produces output like this: confirming that the property does hold</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Running 1 test(s)
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed
VERIFICATION_RESULT: VERIFIED
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, if we change the example property so that the property does not hold,
<code>cargo-verify</code> produces this output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9

running 1 test
  Value a = 0
  Value b = 0
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On this example, random testing and formal verification produced similar
results.
I could have chosen an example where formal verification found a bug that
random testing misses.
Or I could have chosen an example where random testing easily finds
a bug but formal verification spins forever.
But, in this post, I wanted to focus on the similarity between the two
approaches, not the differences.</p>

<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>

<p>In this article, we used an example that was easy to explain but
does not really show off the power of <code>propverify</code>.
Some slightly better examples are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/compatibility-test/src/collections.rs#L60">collections.rs</a>
where we check properties involving standard Rust collection
types such as vectors and B-trees.
(This should be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/collection/index.html">proptest
documentation</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/0a6a0ff2b3880eb4a19d8161bfae8d163b0a65ec/compatibility-test/src/dynamic.rs#L82">dynamic.rs</a>
where we check properties involving trait objects by
quantifying over a subset of the possible instances of the trait.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, we have more documentation about</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-propverify.md">Using the propverify library</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-klee.md">The many, many flags we use when compiling Rust code so that it can be verified with KLEE</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two are mostly for the benefit of verification tool developers.</p>

<h2 id="our-next-steps">Our next steps</h2>

<p><em>[You can either read this as a sketch of what we plan to do or
as an admission of what we have not yet done.
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Fred and Ginger said</a>,
“Tomato. Tomato.”]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tools have a horrifically complicated set of dependencies.</p>

    <p>This is partly because formal verification is not quite popular
enough for enough Debian/Homebrew packages to exist and partly
because we need some very specific versions.
(It may also be possible to remove some dependencies!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-verifier">Crux-MIR</a> support to the library
and tool.
Crux-MIR is a new part of Galois’
<a href="https://galois.com/project/software-analysis-workbench/">Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)</a>
that verifies the MIR code generated by the Rust compiler.</p>

    <p>This is taking us a bit longer than using KLEE
because the functionality of our <code>cargo-verify</code> script
overlaps with the functionality of Crux-MIR but they have slightly different
approaches – we’re still working on the best way to handle the resulting
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to focus our attention on a single crate at a time.
We have some ideas for how to do that with fuzzing and verification
but we have not had a chance to try them yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not looked seriously at how well this approach scales.</p>

    <p>The collections support in the <code>propverify</code> library has a few
tricks to avoid some obvious scaling issues, but we don’t know if
those tricks work well for all verification tools and they
probably only scratch the surface of what needs to be done.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing and formal verification are usually portrayed as mortal enemies.
I think that misses a huge opportunity to use your existing familiarity and
comfort with testing to let you get value out of formal verification tools.</p>

<p>I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">our library and tool</a>,
try it out and give us feedback.
If you are working on a Rust verification tool, we would love it
if you tried to use our library with your tool.
And we would love it even more if you sent us a pull request.</p>

<p>It’s probably not a good idea to commit to using the library at this stage:
it is not very robust at the moment and I expect that it will change a lot
as we gain experience from porting the library to other types of
formal verification tools.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

    <p>The style of test used is a lot like <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/property-based-testing">property-based testing</a>
that started with <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/claessen:icfp:2000">claessen:icfp:2000</a> for Haskell and has since spread
to many other languages.</p>

    <p>In strongly-typed languages, property-based testing usually uses the type to
determine how to generate values
but proptest is inspired by MacIver’s “Hypothesis” for Python <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/maciver:ecoop:2020">maciver:ecoop:2020</a>

  <li>
    <p>The general approach of using test harnesses with symbolic execution
goes back (at least) as far as <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/tillmann:fse:2005">tillmann:fse:2005</a> with
more recent work by

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/goodman:ndss:2018">goodman:ndss:2018</a> applied some very similar ideas to C++ testing
in 2018 using the <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">GoogleTest</a> DSL as a starting point and providing
support for <a href="https://angr.io/">angr</a>, <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2017/04/27/manticore-symbolic-execution-for-humans/">Manticore</a> and <a href="https://dynamorio.org/drmemory_docs/page_drfuzz.html">Dr. Fuzz</a>.</p>

    <p>They ran into and solved problems related to logging (causing a path
explosion), symbolic loop bounds and symbolic array indices (causing
a path explosion) and how to combine swarm testing with verification.</p>

		<section>
			<p>When we are storing data, we typically assume that our storage system of choice returns that data later just as we put it in.
However what guarantees do we have that this is actually the case?
The case made here is the case of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-bit-rot-and-how-can-i-detect-it-rhel">bitrot</a>, the silent degradation of the physical charges that physically make up today’s storage devices.</p>
<p>To counter this type of problem, one can employ data checksumming, as it is done by both btrfs and ZFS.
However, while in the long run btrfs might be the tool of choice for this, it is fairly complex and not yet too mature, whereas ZFS, the most prominent candidate for this type of features, is <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/8314">not</a> <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/">without</a> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/zfs-licensing-and-linux">hassle</a> and it must be recompiled for every kernel update (although <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Custom-Packages">automation exists</a>).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we’ll therefore take a look into a storage design that actually checks whether the returned data is actually valid and not silently corrupted inside our storage system and is completely designed with components available in Linux itself without the need to recompile and test your storage layer on every kernel upgrade.
We find that this storage design, while fulfilling the same purpose as ZFS, does not only yield comparable performance, but actually in some cases even able to significantly outperform it, as the benchmarks at the end indicate.</p>

<p>The system we will test in the following will be constructed from four components (including the filesystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dm-integrity</strong> provides blocklevel checksumming for all incoming data and will check said checksum for all data read through it (and return a read error if it doesn’t match).</li>
<li><strong>mdraid</strong> provides redundancy if a disk misbehaves, avoiding data loss. If the dm-integrity-layer detects invalid data from the disk, mdraid will see a read-error and can immediately correct this error by reading it from somewhere else in the redundancy pool.</li>
<li><strong>dm-crypt</strong> on top of the RAID, right below the filesystem will encrypt the data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>ext4</strong> as a filesystem to actually store files on it</li>
</ul>
<p>The order matters, dm-integrity must be placed between the harddisks and the mdraid, to ensure that data corruption errors can be corrected by mdraid after they have been detected by dm-integrity. Similarly, dm-crypt has nothing to do with redundancy, therefore it should be placed on top of of mdraid, to only having to be passed once, and not multiple times as it would be the case for placing it alongside dm-integrity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This yields the following storage design:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Storage system architecture</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture of the storeage system.

Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/mkstorage.sh.txt">This script will assemble the above depicted system and mount it to /mnt.</a></p>

<p>Now that we have an assembled system, we’d like to quantify the performance impact of the different layers.
The test setup for this is a <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Kobol Helios4</a> (primarily because it’s the intended target platform for this storage system) with four disks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> running Debian 10 “Buster”.
The Helios4 is powered by an energy efficient dual-core ARM SoC optimized for storage systems.
The setup was not built based on the entire disks, but on partitions of a size of 10GiB each, allowing multiple parallel designs and therefore easing the benchmarking procedure, as well as speeding up the experiments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="layer-analysis-of-performance-impact">Layer analysis of performance impact</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>To benchmark throughput, the following commands were used:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=8000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure was repeated ten times for proper statistics for the different cases for both read (<code>r</code>) and write (<code>w</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4 filesystem only (<code>f</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>encryption, topped by ext4 (<code>cf</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>mdraid (RAID6/double parity), topped by the former (<code>rcf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
<li>the final setup, including integrity (<code>ircf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layers.svg" alt="Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see different interesting results in the data:
First of all, the encryption engine on the helios4 is not completely impact free, although the resulting performance is still more than sufficient for the designated uses for a Helios4.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see that adding integrity layer does have a noticable impact on writing, but a negligible impact on reading, indicating that especially for systems primarily intended to read data from adding the integrity layer is a matter of negligible cost.</p>
<p>For write-heavy systems, the performance impact is more considerable, but for certain workloads, such as the home-NAS-case the Helios is designed for, the performance can still be considered fully sufficient, especially as normally the system would cache those writes to a certain extend, which was explicitly disabled for benchmarking purposes (see <code>conv=fdatasync</code> in the benchmark procedure).</p>
<p>The reason for the degradation in write (but not in read) is likely due to the fact that the integrity layer and the mdraid layer are decoupled from one another, the raid-layer is not aware that for a double parity setup it effectively has to write the same information three times, and the integrity layer has to account for all three writes before the data is considered synced as required by <code>conv=fdatasync</code>.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>We have found that the throguhput of such a storage design is yielding useful throughput-rates.
The next question is about the latency of the system, which we will, for simplicity, only estimate for random 4K-reads.
Again, just as above, we will investigate the impact of the different layers of the system.
To do so, we read 100.000 sectors randomly from an 18GB sized testfile filling the storage mountpoint for each configuration after dropping all caches.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Latency comparison of system layers</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layerlatencies.svg" alt="Distribution of latencies in milliseconds for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system. green denotes the median, black denotes the average of the latencies of the respective setup, access times below 1ms were considered cache hits and therefore excluded for the computation of mean and average.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure above yields several interesting insights:
First of all, we do see cache hits close to zero milliseconds, furthermore, we see that the latency distribution is fairly evenly distributed over the available range and finally and most interestingly, we see that the impact of the several layers onto the latency is measurable, but rather irrellevant for typical practical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-comparison-with-zfs">Performance comparison with ZFS</h2>
<p>So far we have tested the setup on its intended target platform, the Helios4.
To compare the resulting system against the elephant in the room, ZFS, we will use a different test platform, based on an Intel i7-2600K as CPU and 4x1TB disks, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> was not reliably buildable on Debian Buster on ARM, and when it actually built, it explicitly stated that 32bit-processors (as the Helios’ CPU) are not supported by upstream, although technically the system would run.</p>
<p>To allow for a cleaner comparison, the testbed was accordinly changed to accomodate for ZFS’s preferences.
As ZFS did not adhere to <code>conv=fdatasync</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the main memory was restricted to 1GB, swap was turned off and the size of the testfile was chosen to be 18GB.
This way, any caching happening would be at least significantly reduced as there was little space next to the OS inside of the main memory for caching.</p>
<p>All tests were run on a Debian 10 “Buster” with Linux 4.19, ZFS was used in form of the package <code>zfs-dkms</code> in version 0.8.2 from backports.
The storage layer for both setups was layouted with double parity (RAID6/raidz2) and, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> package in Debian was not able to do encryption, the mdraid-based setup was also setup without the encryption layer.</p>
<h3 id="throughput-1">Throughput</h3>
<p>The commands used for benchmarking throughput were conceptually the same as above:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=18000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>Although ZFS seemingly does not adhere to any cache dropping or syncing instructions, they were still performed and adhered to by the mdraid-based setup.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput comparison, zfs &amp; md</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-md-throughput.svg" alt="Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-testbed.txt">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The results are very interesting: While the md-based setup performs less consistent in and of itself, it still consistently outperforms ZFS in read performance.
When it comes to write, though, ZFS performs noticably better.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To investigate the cause of this unexpected balance, we note that while ZFS combines raid, integrity and filesystem in one component, for the md-based setup these are separate components.
Of these components, not only the filesystem, but also the <code>dm-integrity</code> implements journalling to avoid inconsistencies in case of a power outage.
This leads to increased work until the transaction has been fully flushed to disk, which can be seen in the next figure, where the md-based system (without the encryption layer) is tested with both journalling enabled and disabled in the integrity layer:</p>
<figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599156332456/7WwIJcqD0.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We all use some VS Code extensions for our day to day development and are always on a hunt for more useful extensions. Here is a list of mine and how I use them:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.peacockcode.dev/">Peacock</a> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593585542633/58FKxSF2u.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt=""></p>
<p>We have all been there when we have two editors open and coded in the wrong one 🤦  Peacock helps me differentiate between different workspaces by setting a different color theme to VS Code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/activeScopeBorder.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easily distinguishable bracket scopes are always good for programming and this extension does it well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/printscreen-select-lines.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you are in the flow but navigating the code from one function to another becomes tedious, this lets you bookmark code at different lines and you can easily access it using shortcuts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There have been times when I have embarrassingly spent more time than needed debugging an error only to find out it was a spelling mistake. This extension keeps that in check.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auiworks.amvim">AmVim</a></p>
<p> I am a huge fan of Vim, it legit increases your productivity without having to touch the trackpad. AmVim is one of the Vim mode extension for VSCode, I found this to be quite good and not bloaty compared to other Vim extensions.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">Settings Sync</a></p>
<p>Settings Sync helps you keep the same environment of VSCode (extensions and preferences) across machines.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log">Turbo Console log</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dysw7p/insert_log_message.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is really useful while debugging, it helps create meaningful logs using shortcuts. All you have to do is highlight the variable and press the keybindings.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode">Tab Nine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/raw/master/assets/tabnine.gif" alt="sdfsdf"></p>
<p>I just recently came across this one in one of <a href="https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips">Chris Bongers</a>'s article. Really like it! It is sometimes just scary how accurately it predicts auto-completion (It uses deep-learning model locally on your machine to come up with the predictions).</p>
<hr><p>
Other than these I use the common ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon theme</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight">Color Highlight</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wart.ariake-dark">Ariake Dark</a> is my VS Code theme.</p>

<p>Hope you found this useful and feel free to share the extensions you use in the comments below. You can also @ me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vamsirao7">twitter</a></p>

<p>How much does running a webapp in production actually cost? Maybe more than you think. Keepthescore.co is a Python flask application running on DigitalOcean and Firebase. It currently has around 55k unique visitors per month, per day it’s around 3.4k.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/money-tree.jpg" alt="A money tree">
<em>Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@micheile">Micheile Henderson</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s a monthly breakdown with some background information on each cost:</p>

<h3 id="servers-and-database-on-digitalocean">Servers and database on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $95</strong></p>

<p>The webapp runs on two identical DigitalOcean servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 80GB disk). We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>, which is a great way of running and hosting a webapp (more on that in a future post) but it does mean that you need 2 identical production servers.</p>

<p>The database is a hosted Postgres instance also on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Note: the servers are oversized for the load we’re currently seeing. The reason for that is that we tried to solve a production issue by increasing the server specs. It didn’t solve the problem, and now we can’t down-size the servers without re-provisioning them 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="code-repo-on-github">Code repo on GitHub</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $0</strong></p>

<p>This is free. Thanks GitHub!
</p><hr>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $60</strong></p>

<p>We use a reporting tool called <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to generate insights and reports from the database. The tool itself is opensource and free, but hosting it is fairly expensive. Currently it runs on an EC2 instance. There are definitely some savings that could be realised here.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $1.32</strong></p>

<p>We use Firebase for the <a href="https://keepthescore.co/basketball-scoreboard/">realtime basketball scoreboard</a>. We also use the Google Sheets API for some custom scoreboards. Overall it must be said that the Google Cloud APIs are great value for money (so far).</p>

<p>We have plans to move away from DigitalOcean and onto Google Cloud infrastructure in the next year.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="dns-hosting">DNS hosting</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $5</strong></p>

<p>Our domain is registered with <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple.com</a>.
</p><hr>



<p><strong>Costs per month: $10</strong></p>

<p>Scoreboards and this blog have the option of allowing a discussion on the same page – this uses the <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> service. Disqus has a free tier but they began showing ads so we were forced to move to the paid tier.</p>

<p>We are planning to move to <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a> in the future, which is cheaper, has no ads, and respects your privacy.
</p><hr>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-it-is-there-revenue">Is it worth it? Is there revenue?</h2>

<p>In total that’s around <strong>$171 USD per month</strong>. If you’re running a company with employees that would be peanuts, but in this case the cost is being borne by a single indie-developer out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is that on the revenue side there’s a big fat zero. This is the reason why we are currently working on monetization. This will include banner ads and payments via Stripe. Expect to see these features land by next week! Anyway, more about that in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-spending-way-too-much-money">You are spending way too much money!</h2>

<p>This post generated an interesting discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24372084">Hacker News</a>. One recurring theme
was that our stack is large and expensive and that we could massively reduce costs.</p>

<p>This is true. But here are some things that are also true:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Reducing costs” is not our primary objective at the moment: time is more valuable than money right now.</li>
<li>Our primary objective right now is velocity of product development.</li>
<li>We are not devops experts and optimizing operations takes time.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a follow up post once we do optimize our stack.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and so long, 👋</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>

    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span>
    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

  <div>
    
    <p>Earlier this year, we contributed a driver for the Input/Output Memory
Management Unit (IOMMU) introduced with the Allwinner H6 SoCs in Linux,
that got merged in Linux 5.8. It felt like a good occasion to write
about what an IOMMU is, what it’s useful for and how it integrates into
Linux.</p>

<p>At the low-level, a CPU executes an infinite sequence of instructions,
some of them either reading or writing to an address in memory.
Depending on the system design, the hardware maps that address to the
main RAM of the system, or to a specific device. The set of all the
memory addresses than the CPU can access is the memory space.</p>
<p>In older or simpler designs, the CPU accesses directly the physical
location on the memory bus of a memory word or register, the physical
address. This simple design is still in use on some micro-controllers
today, but it introduces some issues related to security, and
reliability.</p>
<p>Indeed, that design doesn’t enforce any isolation between processes or
permission checks. This means that any process in the system has
read/write access to the entire memory in the system, including the
kernel and other applications. This could lead to a system-wide memory
corruption if a buggy application starts to write at some random place
in memory. And this is the ideal scenario: indeed, it also allowed any
process to snoop on any memory stored by another process or the kernel,
leading to potential sensitive information leaks if that process was
malicious.</p>
<p>To fix that issue, CPU designs introduced a hardware unit called the
Memory Management Unit (MMU) that intercepts all the memory accesses
done by the CPU once enabled and translates them. This mechanism allows
to have two distinct address spaces: the physical address space that we
talked about earlier, and a virtual address space that the CPU operates
on, the MMU being in charge of translating the virtual addresses into
physical addresses when the CPU access them.</p>
<p>The best part is that the kernel can change the virtual address space
anytime, so it actually uses one virtual address space per process (and
potentially one for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation">kernel</a>). In
addition, the MMU also allows to set extra attributes to carry out
access control over memory ranges, allowing to change whether we want to
allow the associated process to read, write, or execute the data stored
in a particular range.</p>
<p>This mechanism allows the kernel to prevent any process to messing with
the memory of another process at the hardware level, almost entirely
closing the class of attacks we mentioned earlier, and enables
the operating system to provide more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write#In_virtual_memory_management">optimizations</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging">features</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it looks complete, there’s a limitation though: the MMU
translates the addresses used by the <strong>CPU</strong>. Yet, some devices can also
access memory directly without the CPU intervention using a feature
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">Direct Memory Access (DMA)</a>,
and since the CPU isn’t involved, the MMU isn’t either. This means that we’re
still vulnerable to the same class of issues than the one we described earlier
if we perform a misconfigured DMA operation or if an attacker
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMA_attack">manages</a> to trick a device
into reading some other parts of the memory than the one it’s supposed
to access. As an example of such an attack, you can find an in-depth
article explaining how the Google Project Zero team was able to pull
this off on a Nexus 6 modem
<a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/over-air-exploiting-broadcoms-wi-fi_4.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To close that channel of attacks, system designers later integrated
IOMMUs, that fill pretty much the same needs and with the same features
than regular MMUs, but providing that translation and protection to
devices that perform DMA instead of the CPU. It’s not unusual to even
have several IOMMUs: the GPU almost always has its own, and then there
would be another one for the rest or a subset of the devices in the
system.</p>
<p>IOMMUs also allow to address a common issue where the device isn’t able
to access the entirety of the buffer for some reason. It mainly happens
either when the buffer it’s supposed to perform DMA on isn’t contiguous
in physical memory and is thus split between some chunks while the
device can solely perform DMA on a single chunk; or when the device
can’t access the buffer location in RAM due to some limitations. One
common limitation would be that devices can just access the lowest 4 GB
of the RAM (since it’s addressable on 32 bits), while the system might
have more than that. Either way, the way to deal with that situation is
to create a <em>bounce buffer</em>: a temporary buffer that the device can
access and where we’re going to copy the content of the original buffer
to so that the device can access it. There’s an obvious performance cost
to it though, since we could introduce a copy of the whole buffer before
the device can operate on it. Still, IOMMUs save the day once again
since you can basically create any mapping, both accommodating the
non-contiguous case by creating a mapping where the virtual buffer would
be contiguous, and using a virtual address that the device can access.</p>

<h2 id="the-iommu-framework">The IOMMU Framework</h2>
<p>Since an IOMMU is so useful, Linux gained support for IOMMUs using a
dedicated driver framework under <strong>drivers/iommu</strong>. That framework uses
three different concepts to enforce permissions as fine-grained as
possible for a given device: domains, groups, and devices.</p>
<p>A device is quite straightforward, it’s a device that can perform DMA
operations through our IOMMU, a domain is a representation of a virtual
address space and a group is a set of devices that the IOMMU can’t
isolate from each other. The framework then relies on functions to
manage those three concepts. As you can see in
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/iommu.h#n191">the operations that a driver can perform</a>,
all those functions are to manage the relationships between the devices,
groups and domains that the system is going to have, and manage each
individually (to create a mapping in a particular domain for example).</p>
<h2 id="the-dma-api">The DMA API</h2>
<p>The second part of the integration in Linux, once it knows how to
manage the various address spaces through the IOMMU framework and
drivers, is to allow the drivers for the devices that need to perform
DMA to use that IOMMU.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of Linux is to be as portable as possible, and it
does so by abstracting much of the usual driver operations through
frameworks and APIs, and allows to decouple the driver itself (how does
one need to program a device to perform a given operation) from how the
platform works (in our case, how would the platform do DMA, or how
should Linux configure the IOMMU).</p>
<p>DMA is no different here, and Linux has two distinct APIs depending on
the context: the streaming API and the coherent API. As we mentioned
earlier, you would use one over the other depending on the situation
you’re in, and who is in charge of allocating the buffer that gets
accessed through DMA. If the user-space hands the buffer to the driver
(for example when you would send a network packet, or write to a file),
you’d need to setup a temporary mapping through the streaming API. In
other situations though, the kernel would be in charge of allocating the
buffer and then pass that buffer to the user-space—the Direct Rendering
Manager (DRM) and Video4Linux2 (v4l2) can operate like that—, and that
would be where you’d need the coherent API.</p>
<p>The two APIs are here to make sure that the device can perform DMA on
the buffer we want to access. They thus make sure that the device can
access the buffer. What it actually means then depends on the platform,
what memory range the device can access, which memory allocator to use,
etc. Part of that decision involves whether the device accesses go
through an IOMMU, which then gets configured properly to create the
mappings for our buffer in the device’s virtual address space.</p>

<p>We contributed to Linux 5.8 a driver for the IOMMU introduced by
Allwinner in their H6 SoC. Compared to the IOMMUs found on modern PCs,
its design is a bit simple: it doesn’t support virtualization, there’s a
single address space, and it doesn’t cover all the devices doing DMA in
the system but solely the DMA intensive ones: the video and display
devices.</p>
<p>The driver thus registers and allows a single domain and group since the
IOMMU can’t isolate devices from one another, and it supports a single
address space. Despite these limitations though, it’s still a welcome
addition for all the reasons above.</p>
<p>Video and display controllers also require a lot of big, contiguous
buffers allocated through the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) on
earlier SoCs. CMA works by putting aside a part of the system RAM at
boot, and allocating big buffers from that area. There’s a big drawback
now though: the system has to maintain a rather big (in the 100 MB
order), static, pool of RAM put aside, no matter if the system is going
to use its video or display capabilities, and without any way to give
the RAM back if it doesn’t. As we discussed, an IOMMU has the capability
to map several, separate, chunks in physical memory to provide a
contiguous buffer in the device virtual space, effectively reducing (or
even removing) the need for CMA.</p>

<p>With Linux 5.8 onward, the Allwinner H6 uses its IOMMU with the DRM
display driver and the Cedrus video decoder driver. As time goes by and
we enable its usage across more drivers, it benefits more devices.
And with any luck, more Allwinner SoCs will feature an IOMMU.</p>

<p><img alt="Libvirt The Unsung Hero of Cloud Computing Platforms" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_the_unsung_hero.png"></p><p>Initially my intention was to write an article on <strong>Round up of open source Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)</strong>, but while doing research found one piece of software library so fundamental, that it holds the key to very existence of Cloud Computing services and platforms as we know it today (that includes Amazon AWS, OpenStack and CloudStack). So I decided to postpone my idea and started to write an article on this <strong>Unsung hero of Cloud Computing</strong> called libvirt <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, which I believe many people won’t have heard of. Obviously talking about software library tend to be technical, so this article will have a technical tone, but I will attempt to make it readable for everyone interested in Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualzation and these APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of Cloud Management Platform. Libvirt makes it possible to control and manage millions of compute nodes, storage and network devices via common programmable interface. Its like being able to control and orchestrate fleet of millions of car irrespective of different manufacturer, model, or engine through a common interface from a single car (it can be more then one car for redundancy and high availability). What started as a management API for Xen, today has been extended to support major components of Cloud Computing platforms.</p>
<div id="libvirt-goals-architecture">
<h2>Libvirt Goals &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>Libvirt defines following terms for its goals <a href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Mapping of libvirt terms to virtualized or containerized physical machine" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_terms_mapping.png"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong> is a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a layer of softeare allowing to virtualize a node in a set of physical machines with possible different configurations that the node itself.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> is an instance of an operating system (or subsystem in case of container virtualization like OpenVZ and lxc) running on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above terms <strong>“The goal of libvirt is to provide a common and stable layer sufficient to securely manage domains on a node, possibly remote”</strong>. So libvirt should provide all APIs needed to do the management, such as: provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate and stop the domains - within the limits of the support of the hypervisor for those operations. This implies following sub-goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API can be carried remotely though secure APIs</li>
<li>While most API will be generic in term of hypervisor or Host OS, some API may be targeted to a single virtualization environment as long as the semantic for the operations from a domain management perspective is clear</li>
<li>the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations needed to manage domains on a node, including resource provisioning and setup</li>
<li>the API will not try to provide high level virtualization policies or multi-nodes management features like load balancing, but the API should be sufficient so they can be implemented on top of libvirt</li>
<li>stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization framework</li>
<li>the node being managed may be on a different physical machine than the management program using libvirt, to this effect libvirt supports remote access, but should only do so by using secure protocols.</li>
<li>libvirt will provide APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and NUMA partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So libvirt is intended to be a building block for higher level management tools and for applications focusing on virtualization of a single node (the only exception being domain migration between node capabilities which involves more than one node).</p>
<div id="libvirt-driver-based-architecture">
<h3>Libvirt Driver Based Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt driver based architecture" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_architecture.png"></p><p>Libvirt to support wide variety of hypervisor implements a driver-based architecture. Based on car analogy, it means delegating the actual implementation of control of different cars to the drivers specifically designed for make, model and engine of the specific car. Libvirt currently supports:</p>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LXC - Linux Containers</li>
<li>OpenVZ</li>
<li>QEMU</li>
<li>Test - Used for testing</li>
<li>UML - User Mode Linux</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMware ESX</li>
<li>VMware Workstation/Player</li>
<li>Xen</li>
<li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li>
<li>IBM PowerVM (phyp)</li>
<li>Parallels</li>
<li>Remote - Accessing libvirt on remote node through libvirtd (libvirt daemon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directory backend</li>
<li>Local filesystem backend</li>
<li>Network filesystem backend</li>
<li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM) backend</li>
<li>Disk backend</li>
<li>iSCSI backend</li>
<li>SCSI backend</li>
<li>Multipath backend</li>
<li>RBD (RADOS Block Device) backend</li>
<li>Sheepdog backend</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtual Networks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bridging</li>

<li>VN-LINK</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="libvirt-api-structure">
<h3>Libvirt API structure <a href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a></h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_api_structure.png"></p><p>The figure above shows the five main objects exported by the API:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>virConnectPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the connection to a hypervisor. Use one of the virConnectOpen functions to obtain connection to the hypervisor which is then used as a parameter to other connection API’s.</dd>
<dt><strong>virDomainPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one domain either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently running on that node). The function virConnectListAllDomains lists all the domains for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virNetworkPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one network either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently activated). The function virConnectListAllNetworks lists all the virtualization networks for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStorageVolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one storage volume generally used as a block device available to one of the domains. The function virStorageVolLookupByPath finds the storage volume object based on its path on the node.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStoragePoolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents a storage pool, which is a logical area used to allocate and store storage volumes. The function virConnectListAllStoragePools lists all of the virtualization storage pools on the hypervisor. The function virStoragePoolLookupByVolume finds the storage pool containing a given storage volume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These names follow C conventions, but developers of cloud computing platforms and applications do not need to use C directly, there are language bindings available for major languages. Currently libvirt API language bindings <a href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a> are available for C#, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-management-architecture">
<h3>Domain Management Architecture</h3>
<p>There are two distinct means for domain management using libvirt API.</p>
<p><strong>1. Single node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_single_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As illustrated in the figure above in this mode applications (cloud management platform i.e. CMP applications) and domains exist on the same node. In this scenario applications directly works through the libvirt api on the host operating system (os) to control and manage the local domains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_multi_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, applications (CMP applications) using libvirt API and the domains to manage or control are on separate nodes. In this mode a special domain called <strong>libvirtd</strong> (libvirt daemon) needs to run on remote nodes. The management application nodes use the nodes underlying network communicattion to communicate with remote <em>libvirtd</em> through the local libvirt using custom protocol. Actually libvirt uses Remote <a href="#f6" id="id5">[6]</a> driver for communicating with remote node and remote API calls are handled synchronously. Remote driver for libvirt supports a range of transports like:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>tls</em></dt>
<dd>TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) authenticated and encrypted TCP/IP socket, usually listening on a public port number. To use this you will need to generate client and server certificates. The standard port is 16514. This is the <strong>default</strong> transport, if no other is specified.</dd>
<dt><em>unix</em></dt>
<dd>nix domain socket. Since this is only accessible on the local machine, it is not encrypted, and uses Unix permissions or SELinux for authentication. The standard socket names are /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro (the latter for read-only connections).</dd>
<dt><em>ssh</em></dt>
<dd>Transported over an ordinary ssh (secure shell) connection. Requires Netcat (nc) installed and libvirtd should be running on the remote machine. You should use some sort of ssh key management (eg. ssh-agent) otherwise programs which use this transport will stop to ask for a password.</dd>
<dt><em>ext</em></dt>
<dd>Any external program which can make a connection to the remote machine by means outside the scope of libvirt.</dd>
<dt><em>tcp</em></dt>
<dd>nencrypted TCP/IP socket. Not recommended for production use, this is normally disabled, but an administrator can enable it for testing or use over a trusted network. The standard port is 16509.</dd>
<dt><em>libssh2</em></dt>
<dd>Transport over the SSH protocol using libssh2 instead of the OpenSSH binary. This transport uses the libvirt authentication callback for all ssh authentication calls and therefore supports keyboard-interactive authentication even with graphical management applications. As with the classic ssh transport netcat is required on the remote side.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Libvirt is one very important library on whose giant shoulders cloud computing services and platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus and numberous others are standing. Also this API enables developers and companies to build new and innovative cloud computing services or platforms and build awesome applications or services on top of it. Libvirt started in 2005 and with growing popularity of cloud computing, this project will continue to grow. But in most of the conferences, talks and papers related to Cloud Computing I did not find much coverage of libvirt, so while researching Cloud Management platform thought of writing and article on it. Kudos to all the libvirt code contributors for building a beautiful abstraction layer and making life easier for cloud computing services and platform developers. In spite of not getting as much press and coverage as …</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>

The opinions expressed in it are those of its author.)</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="695" data-original-width="695" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>
