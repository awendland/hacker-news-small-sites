  <p>Using events is a common way of integrating different parts of a modular system. But while the concept is easy to grasp, the implementation can be tricker.</p>

<p>Integrating subsystems is hard, and there are always trade-offs. Events are not different.</p>

<p>There are many possible ways of event handling. Choosing the wrong one for your needs can be a serious mistake.</p>

<p>This article shows you some of the choices available and trade-offs you have to consider with each of them. Some are related to Elixir itself, and some are technology-agnostic.</p>

<h2 id="1-synchronous-processing">1. Synchronous processing</h2>

<p>The simplest way to process events is to do this synchronously:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>,</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>\\</span> <span>[</span><span>Mailer</span><span>,</span> <span>Notifications</span><span>])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># You can wrap the entire function in a transaction</span>
    <span># to ensure strong consistency.</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>event_handler</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>event_handlers</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>event_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Synchronous processing has multiple benefits and <strong>it should probably be the first step</strong> (especially for existing applications) unless you need the benefits of asynchronous processing.</p>

<p>If you’re running a modular monolith with a single database, you can even use a database transaction to guarantee strong consistency between the data and the event.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/synchronous.png" alt="synchronous processing"></p>

<p>That way, you can start decoupling your contexts logically (see: <a href="https://mkaszubowski.com/2019/06/28/events-and-different-kinds-of-coupling.html">Events and different kinds of coupling</a>) without dealing with the technical challenges of asynchronous code and eventual consistency.</p>

<p>The trade-off is that synchronous processing and/or a transaction means <strong><em>all or nothing</em> semantics</strong>. Either everything works correctly, or nothing is saved.</p>

<p><em>All or nothing</em> makes the code more predictable and easier to debug, but it’s not always desirable. When it’s an issue? When the customer places an order, you probably want that information saved even if there’s a temporary bug in the code handling that shipping.</p>

<p>When to consider synchronous event processing?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you have little experience with events.</li>
  <li>If you don’t want to introduce additional technical complexity and infrastructure costs.</li>
  <li>In a monolith system, which you’d like to make more modular.</li>
  <li>As a replacement for other mechanisms in the test environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is synchronous processing <strong>not</strong> a good idea?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you need to isolate failures.</li>
  <li>When quick response is crucial (and you know what you’re doing).</li>
  <li>For long-running, asynchronous, or third-party side effects. If side effects are out of your control, it might be a better idea to handle them in a proper asynchronous fashion.</li>
  <li>When side-effects can be delayed or batched in the background for better performance.</li>
  <li>When you’re communicating across different services (in other words - in a distributed system).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-process-based-pubsub">2. Process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Since processes and message passing are basic building blocks in Elixir, we can use an in-memory PubSub mechanism (for example <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html#module-using-as-a-pubsub">Registry</a> or <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html#direct_broadcast/5">Phoenix PubSub for a single node</a>) to broadcast events to subscribers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/pubsub.png" alt="in-memory PubSub"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Subscriber</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>GenServer</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>start_link</span><span>()</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>GenServer</span><span>.</span><span>start_link</span><span>(</span><span>__MODULE__</span><span>,</span> <span>name:</span> <span>__MODULE__</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>init</span><span>([])</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>PubSub</span><span>.</span><span>subscribe</span><span>(</span><span>"user_sign_ups"</span><span>,</span> <span>self</span><span>())</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{}}</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>handle_info</span><span>(%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{}</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>Mailer</span><span>.</span><span>send_welcome_email</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Such in-memory PubSub offers at-most-once delivery semantics</strong>. That means that the message will either be received once or won’t be delivered at all.</p>

<p>At-most-once delivery means that if we handle side effects or events using an in-memory PubSub mechanism, <strong>the side effects are not guaranteed to be executed:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If a subscriber exits before the message is received, it won’t receive the message again.</li>
  <li>If a subscriber crashes when processing the side effect, it won’t try to process it again after restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This approach should only be used if losing some messages is OK</strong>. Some common examples are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In-app notifications.</li>
  <li>Transient application state (e.g. cache).</li>
  <li>Things that can be corrected by next messages or a periodic job.</li>
</ul>

<div><p>Be careful when sending in-memory messages from within a DB transaction: </p><p> 
1) The transaction can be rolled back after a message has been sent. <br>
2) It can lead to hard-to-debug errors when a subscriber receives the message and tries to read the data before a transaction has been committed.</p></div>

<h2 id="3-multi-node-process-based-pubsub">3. Multi-node, process-based PubSub</h2>

<p>Multi-node PubSub (like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html">Phoenix PubSub</a>) allows you to broadcast messages to subscribers on multiple nodes.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/multi-node.png" alt="multi-node in-memory PubSub"></p>

<p>Multi-node PubSub is usually useful for stateful processing when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to synchronize state across multiple nodes (e.g. distributed cache).</li>
  <li>You have clients with long-running connections (WebSocket, long-poll, …) - that’s why Phoenix Channels and LiveView use a multi-node Phoenix.PubSub).</li>
</ul>

<p>As with a single-node PubSub, message delivery is not guaranteed. Use this solution only if losing some messages is fine</p>

<p>With multi-node PubSub, you have to remember to make sure that the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">nodes are connected to form a cluster</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-same-database-for-events--smart-consumer-with-polling">4. Same database for events + smart consumer with polling</h2>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/polling.png" alt="polling for events"></p>

<p>If you need every event to be processed in an async environment, you need some kind of persistent storage.</p>

<p>The first and simplest option is to use a single database for data and events. Then, you can have multiple subscribers fetching the data and processing the events asynchronously.</p>

<p>Benefits of this approach include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low operational cost - you don’t need to add any additional infrastructure.</li>
  <li>The same database for data and events means it’s easier to maintain consistency since you can save events in a transaction. There’s no chance of “orphaned” events and no risk of not saving an event when something happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harder to scale for multiple services because of the coupling to the same DB.</li>
  <li>Harder to scale if the data exceeds a single DB.</li>
  <li>Each subscriber has to implement the logic to fetch the events, keep track of which events it’d already processed, and handle deduplication of events. This can be a lot of repetitive work for a larger system.</li>
  <li>Polling for events in a loop can have higher latency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-use-listennotify">Alternative: Use Listen/Notify</h3>

<p>You can modify the following approach to limit the number of queries done by polling the DB for new events. <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/listen-and-notify-postgresql-commands-in-elixir-187c49597851">If you use PostgreSQL, you can use Listen/Notify</a> to notify subscribers of new events. This way, you only have to ask the DB once (at startup) for the events missed by the subscriber:</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/listen-notify.png" alt="listen-notify"></p>

<h2 id="5-events-in-separate-dbmessage-queue">5. Events in separate DB/message queue</h2>

<p>Once you use a lot of events, or you have multiple services, you will probably use a separate message queue for events. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RabbitMQ</li>
  <li>Amazon SQA</li>
  <li>Google Cloud PubSub</li>
  <li>Kafka</li>
  <li>EventStore</li>
</ul>

<p>(While there are many differences between them, it’s way out of the scope of this article to describe them.)</p>

<p>The major drawback of this solution is that you can no longer rely on DB transactions to maintain consistency between your data and the events.</p>

<p>Consider the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_user</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span>

    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>user</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s no guarantee that the user and the event will be saved atomically.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/timeline.png" alt="timeline of function calls"></p>

<p>If anything goes wrong before those two function calls (or the second one fails), the event is gone forever.</p>

<p>One way of dealing with this is to <strong>treat events as a source of truth.</strong></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Accounts</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>sign_up</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>event</span> <span>=</span> <span>%</span><span>UserSignedUp</span><span>{</span>
      <span>user_id:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span>
      <span>name:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span>
      <span>email:</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>email</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>:ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>save_event</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>)</span>

    <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/cqrs.png" alt="cqrs"></p>

<p>You might have heard about this pattern as <strong>Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).</strong> The biggest challenge with this approach is that we’re now in the realm of <strong>eventual consistency.</strong> The user will eventually be saved in the database, but there’s some unknown delay. CQRS and eventual consistency make the code more complicated at the cost of lower operational coupling.</p>

<p>The important conclusion is that everything is a trade-off and there’s a price to pay for everything. You might lower the operational coupling by introducing a separate message queue, but the price for that is more complicated code and higher operations and infrastructure cost.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-outbox-pattern">6. The outbox pattern</h2>

<p>You can use the outbox pattern when you use events for integration and not as a source of truth, but you cannot lose any events.</p>

<p><img src="https://mkaszubowski.com/assets/img/elixir-event-handling/outbox.png" alt="outbox pattern"></p>

<p>The Outbox pattern relies on having an outbox table in the same database as the data. We use a DB transaction to atomically save the data (the user) and the event. A separate process reads the outbox table in the background, publishes the events to the external message queue, and deletes the events from the outbox.</p>

<p>Outbox pattern guarantees that <strong>each event will be published at least once</strong>, which means that we still have to make sure we can handle duplicated events (but this is a good practice anyway since most message queues have at-least-once delivery semantics).</p>

<h2 id="performance-warning">Performance warning</h2>

<p>It might be tempting to use asynchronous processing to make the system “faster” by doing some of the work after returning a response to the client. Unless you know what you’re doing, <strong>don’t do that.</strong></p>

<p>Doing work in the background doesn’t make it faster. It only hides the work from the client.</p>

<p>Synchronous calls serve as automatic <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Back-Pressure">back pressure</a>. Since the clients wait for the response before making new requests, the server does only as much as it can handle. As the workload increases, so do the response times - which means that each client sends requests at a lower frequency.</p>

<p>Synchronous processing allows your system to slow down gracefully without collapsing. The system slows down, but it doesn’t crash.</p>

<p>If you do some work in the background, the clients can start sending the next requests much …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Of all the projects I’ve made, I receive the most questions about the <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink">Ink programming language</a>. Most questions fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you make a programming language?</li>
<li>I want to make my own programming language – any advice?</li>
<li>Why does Ink work the way it does?</li>
</ol>
<p>This post aims to answer questions (1) and (2) and provide some resources for you to get started on your own language. I think (3) is best left for its own, more technical post.</p>
<p>This post is organized into a few sections.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#why">Why should you?</a></li>
<li><a href="#design">Design</a></li>
<li><a href="#impl">Implementation</a></li>
<li><a href="#other">Other considerations</a></li>
<li><a href="#start">Start small, get creative, ask questions</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-should-you">Why should you?</h2>
<p>Making an interpreter for a new programming language is the most technically rewarding project I’ve worked on. It pushed my understanding of fundamental software concepts and helped me comprehend how a computer works at a deeper level.</p>
<p>Programming languages and compilers / interpreters can be black boxes for programmers starting out. They’re tools taken for granted, and you can write good software without necessarily worrying about how the languages and primitive tools you’re using work under the hood. But writing a programming language involves understanding the most meaty parts of the computing stack, from the CPU and memory up through the operating system, in-memory data structures, processes, threads, the stack, all the way up to libraries and applications. It’s the floodgate to the most interesting mathematics in computing – category theory and type systems, algebras, lots of applications of graph theory, complexity analysis, and more. <strong>Writing and studying programming languages, I found myself getting more familiar with both the mathematics and the mechanical underpinnings of how computers work.</strong></p>
<p>The project made me a better developer as a result, even if my day-to-day work rarely concerns programming language tooling or compiler writing.</p>
<p>A programming language also has lots of room for expansions, optimizations, and extra creativity even after the project’s version one is “finished”. If you design the initial implementation carefully, you can add new keywords, new features, optimizations, and tools to your language and interpreter / compiler incrementally over time. It’s easy to turn a language into a long-term project and creative outlet, and I’ve enjoyed expanding on my initial implementation while studying other languages after my version-one was complete.</p>
<h3 id="the-pl-world-is-broad-and-deep-pick-your-battles">The PL world is broad and deep; pick your battles</h3>
<p>Unlike some other areas of software that follow hype cycles, the programming language field has grown and deepened steadily and constantly for a long time in both academia and industry. There’s a <em>lot</em> of literature, research, prior art, and practical advice in the wild about a million different concepts that can be combined into a new language, and a million different variations on how to implement them.</p>
<p>Especially for a personal-project language, I think the most fruitful approach is to <strong>pick one or two interesting ideas from the archaeology of computing, and build a programming language that examines and expands on those ideas deeply</strong>, rather than try to build the One True Language that’s best at everything and combines the best features of all the languages. Not only is it impossible to make such a language for all use cases, I think that kind of mindset also slows down development, adds unnecessary work, and doesn’t give you the mental space to learn as much about a few interesting topics you might be interested in.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in functional programming and immutable data structures. You could try to build a language that’s designed around storing all state in immutable data structures, and study how such data structures can be optimized and manipulated efficiently in a compiler. Or maybe you’re interested in low-level C programming and systems languages, in which case you might try to build a scripting language whose primary goals include elegant interoperability with C APIs and binary interfaces.</p>
<p>Where you start also determines the challenges and tradeoffs you’ll contend with. You might have an easier time writing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> interpreter due to its simpler syntax, because it’s easy to parse compared to, say, a more complex syntax for a language with a static type system. However, Lisps tend to have semantics that are further-removed from the low-level machine code that runs, like closures. So you may trade off the ease of parsing with execution complexity.</p>
<p>Pick your battles carefully, and stick to a few core ideas that you want to study deeply.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Before you write either an interpreter or a compiler, you need to <em>design</em> a language. You can spend time studying category theory and type systems and programming paradigms, but the best thing you can do for yourself at this stage is to study ideas from a wide breadth of programming languages. Don’t just limit yourself to “modern” languages like Rust and Python; reach back into computing history. There’s rich ideas to be reinvented and combined in interesting ways reaching back at least a century into computing and mathematics.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the mental model of popular modern OOP-like languages (Python, Ruby, Swift, C++) and spend the most time in this phase designing <em>syntax</em>. But designing the <em>semantics</em> of the language is where you should spend the most of your time, because it’s where the language gets its “feel” and where you’ll learn the most. Semantics are also more difficult to change after the fact than syntax. Some questions to ask yourself, to start thinking about language semantics and ergonomics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types does your language have? Is it checked at compile-time? Does it automatically convert between types as necessary?</li>
<li>What’s the top-level organizing unit of programs in your language? Languages commonly call this modules, packages, or libraries, but some languages may invent their own concept, like Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/crates.html">Crates</a>.</li>
<li>How does the language deal with exceptional conditions, like a missing file, a network access error, or a divide-by-zero error? Do you treat errors like exceptions that bubble up through the call stack, or are errors treated like values, as in C and Go?</li>
<li>Does your language perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail recursion optimization</a>? Or do you provide native control-flow tools for looping, like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops?</li>
<li>How much utility do you want to build into the language, as opposed to a standard library? C, for example, doesn’t know about strings – string semantics are provided by the C standard library. Maps and lists are fundamental language constructs in most high-languages, and not so in most low-level ones.</li>
<li>How does your language think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">allocating memory</a>? Is memory automatically allocated as needed? Does the developer need to write code to do so? Is it garbage-collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>To answer these questions, I think it’s most helpful to just get a taste of a variety of languages in the wild. Here’s a small starter set that I recommend you take a look at, and what ideas I personally found intriguing from each language or language family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua</strong>: a data structure called <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">tables</a>, Lua <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/9.1.html">couroutines</a>, using strings as byte slices, interoperability with C</li>
<li><strong>Scheme / Clojure</strong>: Metaprogramming with macros, homoiconicity, closures, control flow with recursion. Die-hard Common-Lispers may disagree, but Scheme and Clojure are the easiest languages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> family of languages for me to learn. You should study at least one kind of Lisp.</li>
<li><strong>Go</strong>: structural typing with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/methods/9">interfaces</a>, concurrency with blocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads">green threads</a></li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: callback-style concurrency and asynchronous programming, first-class functions, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">event loop</a>, Promises</li>
<li><strong>Awk</strong>: Awk is a great example of a small, simple language optimized for one use case: manipulating text files and textual data. It’s very well designed for that workflow, and a inspiration for how effective a small, domain-specific language with simple semantics can be.</li>
<li><strong>APL</strong> / <strong>J</strong>: APL and J are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming#Array_languages">array languages</a>, which is a fascinating family of languages well known for its brevity</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong>: syntax. Ruby’s well known for its super-flexible syntax, because it lends itself easily to DSLs based on Ruby, like ActiveRecord.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: I like C mostly for its simplicity and minimalism, and an uncompromising commitment to compatibility</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: the type system and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism">parametric polymorphism</a>, variant types, partial application and function type syntax. Once you wrap your mind around it, Haskell is also a good place to start diving deeper into the kinds of elegant programs possible with functional programming.</li>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Once you have a design for how a language should work and feel, you should first “test-drive” it to see how programs written in the language feel to use.</p>
<h3 id="test-drive">Test-drive</h3>
<p>In this phase, I usually keep a text document where I experiment with syntax by writing small programs in the new as-yet-nonexistent language. I write notes and questions for myself in comments in the code, and try to implement small algorithms and data structures like recursive mathematical functions, sorting algorithms, and small web servers. I usually hold myself to this stage until most of my questions about syntax and semantics are answered. I also use this phase to test my hypotheses about the core ideas behind the language design. If I designed a language around functional programming and asynchronous, event-driven concurrency, for example, I’d write some sample code in this phase to validate that those ideas combine well together, and lends itself to programs that I’d enjoy writing. If I’m proven wrong, I’ll update my assumptions or play around with the language design to reflect what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>This straw-man design phase is a quick way to make sure that the language you’ve invented in your head could work well for the kinds of programs you want to write, without having to write much implementation.</p>

    <meta itemprop="description" content="A fast concurrent persistent key-value store and log, in C# and C++. Latest release v1.7.4">
    
    

    <section itemprop="text">
      <p>Managing large application state easily, resiliently, and with high performance is one of the hardest
problems in the cloud today. The FASTER project offers two artifacts to help tackle this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER Log</strong> is a high-performance concurrent persistent recoverable log, iterator, and random 
reader library in C#. It supports very frequent commit operations at low latency, and can quickly saturate 
disk bandwidth. It supports both sync and async interfaces, handles disk errors, and supports checksums. Learn 
more about using the FASTER Log in C# <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>FASTER KV</strong> is a concurrent key-value store + cache (available in C# and C++) that is designed for point 
lookups and heavy updates. FASTER supports data larger than memory, by leveraging fast external 
storage (local or cloud). It also supports consistent recovery using a new checkpointing technique that lets 
applications trade-off performance for commit latency. Learn more about the FASTER KV in C# 
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">here</a>. For the FASTER C++ port, check <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-cpp/">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<ol>
  <li>Latch-free cache-optimized index, in FASTER KV.</li>
  <li>A fast persistent recoverable append-only log based on fine-grained epoch protection for concurrency, 
in FASTER Log.</li>
  <li>Unique “hybrid record log” design in FASTER KV, that combines the above log with in-place updates, to 
shape the memory working set and retain performance.</li>
  <li>Architecture as a component that can be embedded in multi-threaded cloud apps.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous non-blocking recovery model based on group commit.</li>
  <li>A rich extensible storage device abstraction called <code>IDevice</code>, with implementations for local
storage, cloud storage, tiered storage, and sharded storage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For standard benchmarks where the working set fits in main memory, we found FASTER KV to achieve
significantly higher throughput than current systems, and match or exceed the performance of pure 
in-memory data structures while offering more functionality. See our <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/td-research-papers/">research papers</a>
for more details. We also have a detailed analysis of C# FASTER KV performance in a wiki page 
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/wiki/Performance-of-FASTER-in-C%23">here</a>. The performance of the 
C# and C++ versions of FASTER is very similar. FASTER Log is also extremely fast, capable of saturating modern
NVMe SSDs using less than a core of CPU, and scaling well in a multi-threaded setting.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We now support variable-length keys and values in FasterKV C# via <code>Memory&lt;byte&gt;</code> and more generally <code>Memory&lt;T&gt; where T : unmanaged</code> as key/value/input types. We also added
a new type called <code>SpanByte</code> to represent variable-length keys and values. See the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/FASTER/tree/master/cs/samples/StoreVarLenTypes">here</a> for details on these capabilities. This is in addition to the existing object-log support for class types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We support C# async in FASTER KV (and FASTER Log). See the guides for <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterkv-basics/">FasterKV</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/FASTER/docs/fasterlog-basics/">FasterLog</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		        
<p>On almost every product I’ve worked on, we’ve relied on a core group of active users to steer the development via great feedback and feature ideas. At Shapeways, <strong>most of our highly successful features came directly from our community.</strong> People who love your product are heavily invested in making it better. They will put in the time if you give them the space to do so and take their feedback seriously.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll share how teams have recruited, setup, and ran customer advisory councils (also called a customer advisory boards) that brought us a regular drip feed of high quality feedback. I’ll also share the mistakes we made along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To get the most relevant feedback, pick users who represent your target audience.</li>
<li>PM should start the council and run it for a few months then hand it off once it’s generating high quality feedback.</li>
<li>I recommend group / synchronous (e.g. video calls) sessions so you can ask follow-up questions and other users can chime in with their thoughts.</li>
<li>You should actually listen to their feedback (and implement it). Otherwise they will stop participating.</li>
<li>Bonus points if you can give them early access to features so they feel special (and you get early signal).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why start an advisory council</h2>
<p>As your userbase grows, it becomes very challenging to understand what people actually think about your product. You’ll quickly get to a point where you are relying on data and expensive user research studies just to keep a pulse on what job people are hiring your product for and where it’s falling over. The beauty of an advisory council is that you don’t just get to hear from some of your best users, they’ll gather feedback on your behalf from other community members. It is by far the most effective way to start to get real stories from real users that are passionate about improving your product to meet their needs. I’m not suggesting that it’s the only signal you should care about, but it should be a tool in your toolbox alongside data and formal user studies.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how advisory counciles drove impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/introducing-etsys-2016-seller-advisory/37704589529">Etsy launched their ‘Seller Advisory Board’ in 2016</a> with 15 sellers picked from a pool of 600 applicants and asked them one simple question: “What’s the most important thing to your buyers?” After some deliberation the group agreed: the speed of the website. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCBMxCIgNcw">Video Interview</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://community.ebay.com/t5/Professional-eBay-Sellers/PESA-members-in-eBay-s-Voices-program/gpm-p/7829699">Ebay had a ‘Voices’ program where they fly out power users for a multi-day summit</a> filled with one-hour feedback sessions. Voices members were steering eBay feedback as early as 2000. <a href="https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/abblog/blog.pl?/pl/2009/8/1250740707.html">The voices program was closed in 2009</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to start an advisory council</h2>
<p><strong>Identifying your council</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to identify who from your audience should join your council. You should start by defining who your target / mvp audience is and then filtering within that group. If you want to serve pro surfers from Australia, filter your userbase to that group and then look at their activity. <strong>You want users who are active, vocal, and constructive and represent your target audience.</strong> I typically will look at forums or customer service conversations to hand pick the first group. If your product has an interactive format (e.g. a game or a social media app), you should be able to spot folks using your product publicly. You want to avoid users who are constantly negative (they will drown out the voices of those who want to help) and have needs that are drastically different than one you plan to fulfill (e.g. if you are building a consumer 3d printing company for dog tags, you should include cat owners but not enterprise auto manufacturers).</p>
<p><strong>Recruiting members</strong></p>
<p>Reach out to each member and send them a personal e-mail or note. You need to make it clear that you’re handpicking them (so they feel special), that you value their input (so they feel wanted), and that you plan to involve them in the development process (so they feel like a part of the team). It’s important not to set expectations (e.g. we will ship your feature) because there’s a good chance you won’t use their feedback in the timeframe they expect. If you have a specific time commitment in mind or rewards you can offer (see '<a href="#council-love-you">How to get your council to love you</a>' below), make them known upfront. I strongly recommend avoiding any NDA’s if possible. Yes, you’re letting them behind the curtain of the developent process, but you should be able to keep any extreme trade secrets out of the way and you WANT them to tell their friends about how awesome it was to be a part of this. This is a great way to grow via word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting members</strong></p>
<p>Don’t use fancy tools like mailing lists or contact forms to communicate with your council. These make it feel very formal and like they’re just on another mailing list. You want them to feel like part of the team. Either stick to e-mail or use something simple like a Facebook group or Slack channel that facilitates group interaction. Make sure each email sounds personal and use an e-mail address that supports reply-to so they can send you open ended questions or feedback. You’d be surprised how many great ideas start as a random email reply to an event invite.</p>
<p><strong>Who should run the council?</strong></p>
<p>There are a ton of upfront decisions that need to be made to ensure that you get good feedback that is useful to the product team. Because of this, I strongly recommend that the PM sets up the council along with any early processes and facilitation. This will ensure that you personally get value from the group. Once the process is humming and you’re regularly getting great feedback, you can hand it off to  I also suggest inviting at least your designer(s) and any eng that are product-minded. It’s more powerful to hear the ideas/feedback directly from the source than for you to proxy their comments.</p>
<h2>How to run the advisory council</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve chosen your council and they’ve agreed to help. Now what do you actually do together?</p>
<p><strong>Structure and cadence</strong></p>
<p>There are a few options for how you run your council. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group vs. 1:1 setting</li>
<li>Synchronous vs. asynchronous</li>
<li>Scheduled vs. ad hoc</li>
<li>Video vs text</li>
<li>Structured vs unstructured</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/gather-great-feedback-from-power-users/lebowski.jpg">
<p><strong>I’ve found that getting as close to ‘a group of people sitting in the room shooting the shit’ as possible is key.</strong></p>
<p>I recommend a lightly structured synchronous group discussion over video. This allows you to facilitate in realtime and keep the vibe lighthearted (so it doesn’t feel like work) but still dig into meaty questions and hear multiple perspectives. To make this work, you’ll need to schedule time in advance and have a rough set of questions you want to cover as a starting point. You’ll also need to make sure that your team knows the ground rules: Can anyone ask questions? Are certain topics off limits? How do we talk about what’s in development right now?</p>
<p><strong>Facilitating the discussion</strong></p>
<p>When the discussion begins, people will look to you to lead it. Treat this like leading a meeting and assume that you need to drive the majority of the conversation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the meeting with a loose agenda (e.g. “We will share a few recent feature developments to get your thoughts, we’ll then open the floor for Q&amp;A, we’ll leave 10 mins for you to ask questions”)</li>
<li>Make it clear when you’re calling on specific people vs when you want anyone to speak</li>
<li>Develop a protocol like ‘hand raising’ but online and try to enforce it. Many community members are going to be introverted and will get drowned out by the few talkative ones. Give everyone space.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important part here is the Q&amp;A. You should come armed with a set of questions way too long for you to ever get through. They should typically have open ended answers (like most user research questions) and be very explicit. Try not to hand wave like “If we built a feature that kinda let you sorta do X, would you use it?” Instead focus on specific questions related to their workflow, their problems, and how they use your product.</p>
<p>One of the best questions I’ve asked is “What step of your workflow takes the longest and why?” <strong>(because it led to specific bottlenecks in our app that we could optimize)</strong> and one of the worst questions I’ve asked is “What is the one feature you want more than anything?” <strong>(because you will get a bunch of random not-thoughtful responses).</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-power-of-interviewing-customers-the-right-way-from-twitters-ex-vp-product/">Michael Sippy, VP Product at Twitter, keeps his sessions laser focused on problems</a>: <em>“The point is that we’re supposed to be solving a problem for people, and understanding that problem on a really fundamental level,” says Sippey. “Only then can you create a product that actually resonates with the market, and a business that can scale beyond any one feature.”</em></p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to let the discussion wander, let multiple community members answer the same question, or let them discuss amongst themselves. One member will often be inspired by another and share really helpful insights, so make sure you encourage the group to interact.</p>
<p>If you're struggling with this test, I suggest reading the book '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742">The Mom Test</a>' which gives a step by step guide to asking questions which will get at the pain point/problems customers are facing.</p>
<p><strong>Handling ideas during downtime</strong></p>
<p>When your council isn’t meeting, your community members will still have ideas and feedback. I’ve found that creating an asynchronous forum (e.g. Slack, Facebook group, etc.) can be useful for sporadic ideas so they don’t get lost. Try not to create a contract like “we will respond to your slack in 24h!” but your team does need to respond. If your users feel like they’re throwing their ideas into the ether, they won’t continue to do so. I typically will respond to the async forum once per day and then refer back to it when I am writing questions for the next get-together.</p>
<p>Asynchronous groups are great for getting quick answers to specific quetions. <a href="https://firstround.com/review/start-up-on-the-right-foot-build-a-customer-advisory-board/">TalentBin used their council for small data-driven asks</a>: <em>“We wanted to ask, 'What are the average contract values you guys sell?' and get a quick response, so we chose 10 of the people who have come to all our dinners and who we felt …</em></p></div></div>

<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index split</figcaption>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hash-index-in-postgresql"><a href="#hash-index-in-postgresql">Hash Index in PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>BEGIN</span>

</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>
<span>─────────────────────────┼───────┼──────────┼────────</span>
<span>shorturl_key_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 73 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_key_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 37 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 53 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 36 MB</span>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Document management is a core requirement for all sorts of regulated institutions - finance, telecom, healthcare, government and others. These institutions need to manage and retain an ever growing number of documents and regulatory guidelines often require these documents to be stored for a very long term (7-10 years). <br></p><p>Take for example, KYC (Know Your Customer) documents. Anyone starting a relationship with a financial institution needs to provide KYC documents. These documents are then stored with the institution as long as the relationship exists and even beyond that for several years. <br></p><p>Traditional document management systems are simply no longer able to provide the scale, cost efficiency and reliability that such use cases require. This has triggered the move to modern, cloud native solutions. <br></p><p>In this document we go through various challenges with traditional document management solutions and then look at the next generation solutions that some of our customers have developed.</p><h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2><h3 id="closed-monolith">Closed Monolith</h3><p>Traditional document management systems are monolithic, closed systems. This means IT teams can not take advantage of new paradigms like segregation of concerns (i.e. microservices), API access, disaggregating storage and compute, among others. Adding features or scaling such systems simply means paying for new licenses. <br></p><p>Additionally, these systems are built as blackboxes with little to no extensionsibility. So, the IT teams have to work around these tools to achieve their intended workflow.</p><h3 id="limited-system-integration-capabilities">Limited System Integration Capabilities</h3><p>Traditional Document management systems are inherently closed, with little to no API integration to plug into external systems, or plugin other tools. This creates a vendor lock-in, higher the number of documents a system manages, the tougher it becomes to get rid of the system.<br></p><p>This is orthogonal to the modern approach of native API integrations with other systems to build powerful features by composition of tools and technologies..</p><h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3><p>Typical document management systems use databases combined with file systems. Both databases and file systems are well known to have difficulties in handling large data volumes. The scalability challenges in the underlying database and file system, invariably show up as the number of documents grows. <br></p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>Documents are essentially unstructured blobs of varying formats and sizes, ideal for object storage platforms like MinIO. With seamless scalability, API integration with major modern data platforms to enable search, audit logs and other important features, MinIO fits right in. <br></p><p>Here we propose a highly scalable approach to build a modern, cloud-native document store.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cRg4-T5csoo6bC4Tu3wJgsPN8Q5gtYPInRokwDfZTQOOxLl3DCXtf6LA__Wzv-8ZMcCGjZAvJy_x367ASBi0QbEtd-BtiiqJ7xI3a7vW8c3NQOQFw5Vy72Jamzg9x2jKdsO8ueqm" alt=""></figure><p>Let’s take a closer look at the architecture, its components and their interaction:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Modern JS based frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte provide a great starting point for building the frontend for enterprise applications like this. Since all these frameworks are API driven, it is quite easy to integrate these with backend, special purpose applications like Identity and Access Management, DB, Object Storage among others. <br></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Text/Metadata Search: </strong></strong></strong>A<strong> </strong>key requirement for a document management system is to allow searching the whole document catalog for specific documents. This search may be based on document metadata (like owner-name, owner-id, document-type etc), or even based on contents of the document itself. Either way, any document metadata can be sent to text search tools like <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/">MeiliSearch</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">Elastic</a>. <p>Essentially, MinIO can be <a href="https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-bucket-notification-guide.html">configured to send out event notifications</a> (with object metadata) to the text search platform. This way, the search platform then has all the document metadata and a link to the actual document in MinIO. The frontend can then send the user query the text search platform and fetch the relevant document.</p><p>Apart from simple text search, the object data and metadata from MinIO can be fed to Machine Learning pipelines as explained in <a href="https://blog.min.io/hyper-scale-machine-learning-with-minio-and-tensorflow/">this blog post</a>. This opens up opportunities to analyse and understand not only the metadata but also the actual documents, opening up business insights for the teams to leverage.</p></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Webhook: </strong></strong></strong>Customer documents are secure and private objects, it is very important for the compliance or audit teams to ensure that a detailed audit log of the document is maintained. <p>MinIO can be <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/logging#audit-targets">integrated with various target systems</a> to send out audit logs. MinIO webhook integration allows seamless integration with any platform that supports webhooks, while removing dependency from message queue type systems. </p><p>Additionally, MinIO ensures that events missed while the remote webook target is offline are delivered later, as and when the target comes back online. Events pending for delivery are stored securely on MinIO, making sure that the audit log doesn’t miss any entry.</p></li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Object Storage:</strong> This is the backbone of the whole system. It provides scalable, persistent storage for documents (and their multiple versions), related metadata, user-access policies among other information. There are several unique advantages with a MinIO object storage vs. generic or legacy solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ILM based Tiering &amp; Archival: Lifecycle management feature allows automatically moving data from one storage tier to another (e.g. Warm/Hot to Archival) or even expire certain objects after they are no longer required.	This allows IT teams to ensure that only the frequently accessed documents are kept in the fast tier, while the other, infrequently accessed documents are moved to archival tier which potentially uses cost effective hardware allowing almost limitless storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active-Active replication: High availability and protection from data loss is critical for document management systems. MinIO Active-Active replication comes in handy here. Users can configure the MinIO cluster to replicate objects to a remote MinIO cluster. This means IT teams can leverage a 2 DC approach to ensure data is safe from a complete DC failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cohasset certified object locking &amp; object retention: MinIO object retention and locking capabilities are certified by Cohasset. This means IT teams can be sure that MinIO software is complaint to the the appropriate regulator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document versions: MinIO object versioning allows seamless storage of multiple versions of a document. This  maps very well to real life situations where customers may need to provide new documents due to issues in older versions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><div><p>Document management is not immune to the advancements in cloud technologies, microservices and API-driven development. Having said that, compliance, particularly regulatory compliance does cause innovation to lag. The trend we are seeing today, however, is that major financial institutions are moving toward a model where object storage serves as the foundational element in KYC architectures. </p><p>Modern object storage is scalable, resilient, performant and in the case of MinIO, certified for object locking and retention. </p><p>We think this modern architecture is the optimal approach for regulated institutions like finance, telecom, healthcare, government. </p><p>And this is why all ten of the largest banks in the US run MinIO and eight of the ten largest banks in Europe run MinIO. </p><p>To learn more, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@min.io">hello@min.io</a> and we can go into more detail than we can publicly.</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/zutty">Zutty</a> is the best X terminal emulator you have never heard of. It
employs a radically simple, massively parallel rendering algorithm to
completely offload the work of drawing the terminal screen to the GPU.
This is quite different from how other terminal emulators operate,
GPU-accelerated ones included. You can read more on <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/2020/11/How-Zutty-works">How Zutty works</a>.</p>

<p>Here I am interested in comparing Zutty to some alternatives: partly
those that are well-known and have been around for many decades, but
also (and especially) to other, newer programs similar to Zutty in
that they also employ some kind of GPU-based rendering.</p>

<p>The comparison will be unashamedly <em>biased</em>: as the author of Zutty, I
have a natural tendency to select criteria that makes Zutty look good.
At the same time, I will try to make a fair comparison based on
quantifiable metrics. Please note: I am in no way trying to convey
that Zutty is altogether superior to any of the programs mentioned
here; all of the programs are useful to at least some people and they
have been written by obviously talented and dedicated programmers. I
do not believe in reducing ranking among programs to a one-dimensional
metric (a.k.a, “which program is better/best”), as the answer is, in
nearly all aspects, “it depends”. The standard disclaimer also
applies: terminals are notoriously complex beasts and my findings with
any of the terminals might be due to “other factors” (including my own
mistakes).</p>

<p>That said, I will aim to show that Zutty provides a compelling set of
features at a high level of correctness and excellent performance
characteristics. Compared to existing GPU-accelerated terminal
emulators, Zutty runs on a wider range of graphics hardware by virtue
of only requiring OpenGL ES as opposed to “desktop” OpenGL, and its
resource demands are otherwise minimal. All this is provided by a
relatively tiny codebase.</p>

<p>Zutty has been written from scratch, and while doing so, I have <em>not</em>
consulted the implementation of any other terminal emulator. As a
result, Zutty has a clean-room codebase unencumbered by historical
baggage. The pervasive cross-pollination observed across the terminal
emulator ecosystem is not necessarily a problem in itself, but fresh
blood certainly makes for better diversity than endless recycling.</p>

<p>At the same time, one could argue that Zutty is not for everyone: it
runs on Linux only (at the moment) and is tied to the X client API (if
only for creating a window and receiving events). It has relatively
little in the “fancy features” department, even though it is quite
configurable (for the things I care about, anyway). But it also has a
list of missing features: things that should eventually be supported,
but are currently missing.</p>

<p>Comparison criteria will be grouped into three broad categories:
Features and correctness; performance and resource usage; and finally
miscellaneous (developer-oriented) metrics.</p>



<p>All programs are actively developed with publicly accessible codebases
and recent releases. Sorted in decreasing order of popularity/ubiquity
(no science here, just my gut feeling):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html">xterm</a>: The standard
terminal emulator for the X Window System, the venerable xterm is
the mother of all X terminal emulators. Carrying several decades of
historical baggage, but at the same time complete with support for
(almost) any terminal-related standard or feature. Runs on every
platform supported by the X Window System.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">gnome-terminal</a>: The
GNOME Terminal Emulator, as its name suggests, is the official
terminal emulator provided by the GNOME project. It is released
under the GNU GPLv3 or later. Gnome terminal uses the
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Terminal/VTE">VTE</a> library under the
hood, which places it on equal footing with Xfce-terminal,
Terminator, and a long list of others. Enormous installed base.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html">urxvt</a>: Also
known as rxvt-unicode, a Unicode-oriented reboot of rxvt, itself a
dumbed down clone of xterm. Boasts features such as “crash-free”,
“flicker-free”, using much less memory than xterm, customizability
with embedded Perl, etc. Still widely used and referred to, and has
a reputation of being fast. Released under the GNU GPLv3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://st.suckless.org/">st</a>: A “simple terminal” provided by
the “suckless” project. It is released under the X/MIT license.
This program expressly positions itself as minimal (bloat-free)
and highly performant. Configuration requires recompilation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a>: The first
GPU-accelerated terminal emulator to achieve widespread adoption,
famously claiming itself to be “the fastest terminal emulator
in existence” (more on this claim below). Written in Rust, a new
language for systems programming. Runs on several UNIX-like
platforms. Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>: Another GPU-accelerated
terminal written in C and Python. Has its own framework for
extensions written in Python. Runs on Linux and MacOS. Advertises
itself as a “feature full [<em>sic</em>], cross-platform, <em>fast</em>, GPU
based” terminal emulator. Released under the GNU GPLv3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/zutty">Zutty</a>: GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written by this
author, aimed at low-end (low-cost, low-energy) systems with
hardware support for OpenGL ES 3.1. Written in C++, runs on
Linux. Released under the GNU GPLv3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>My regular low-energy home desktop system is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Tinker_Board">ASUS TinkerBoard
S</a> with an RK3288
32-bit SoC containing an ARM Mali T760 GPU providing hardware support
for OpenGL ES 3.2. Unfortunately, not all tested programs are capable
of running on this (otherwise quite capable) system: Alacritty and
Kitty require “desktop” OpenGL and thus cannot run on this board.  On
the other hand, Zutty runs perfectly fine and is my primary terminal
here.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this article, my test system is a six year old
Lenovo laptop with a 4-core i5-4210U CPU and an Intel Haswell Mobile
chipset with integrated graphics, providing hardware support for
OpenGL ES 3.1 and OpenGL 3.0. Contrary to my low-energy desktop, this
is a 64-bit system. The software is Debian Buster (current stable); I
use the i3 window manager, and the configured locale is <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>.</p>

<p>All terminal window screenshots linked into this article were produced
by the <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/zutty/doc/HACKING.html#Automated%20testing">automated testing</a>
toolkit of Zutty. As documented, this toolkit is capable of evaluating
other terminals as well as Zutty, and to collect the screenshots and
data presented below, I relied on exactly this capability.</p>



<p>The below table summarizes essential features of each tested terminal.</p>

<p>The value of <code>TERM</code> within the shell started by the terminal conveys
the terminal’s type to programs being run in it. For terminals
providing their own terminfo entries, the table links to that data as
well as a diff to the quasi-standard <code>xterm-256color</code> used by others.</p>

<p>Device attributes (VT self-identification) are what the terminal
proclaims about itself when queried. This is revealed by <a href="https://invisible-island.net/vttest/vttest.html">VTTEST</a> menu
items 6.4 and 6.5, and the links PDA (primary device attributes) and
SDA (secondary device attributes) lead to the corresponding screen
captures of each program.</p>

<p>All established programs were tested with their version present in
Debian Buster (current stable). The latest stable release of Kitty was
manually installed, as was Alacritty. Alas, Alacritty stopped
releasing .deb files, so I tested their last version for which a .deb
was released.</p>

<h2 id="vt-support-levels">VT support levels</h2>

<p>The above table is sorted by descending level of proclaimed terminal
support. The difference between implementing a VT400 or VT500 terminal
(provided the implementations are correct) is relatively
inconsequential. The same cannot be said of the gap between these and
VT220-level terminals. Programs running in a less capable virtual
terminal must sometimes use longer series of basic escape sequences to
achieve the results of a fewer number of more modern ones. For
example, the DECLRMM control sequence (set left-right margin mode) is
available from the VT420 and up, and will be used to restrict
scrolling to the active part of two horizontally split <code>tmux</code> panes. On
less capable terminals, <code>tmux</code> is forced to perform more work to
achieve the same result. This is quite similar to how extended
instructions on modern CPUs allow machine code to be more efficient
than code compiled for an older machine. In other words, not
implementing a modern VT variant goes directly counter to greater
efficiency. And there is yet another downgrade from VT220 to those
terminals that only claim to support VT100/VT102.</p>

<p>It is surprising how unambitious the newer terminals Alacritty and
Kitty are in this regard. I would have hoped that new, supposedly
state-of-the-art entrants would take the effort to add support for
modern VT standards. Switching from xterm to Alacritty (or any other
modern terminal) should not be a major downgrade.</p>

<h3 id="side-note-on-vt52-support">Side note on VT52 support</h3>

<p>On the low end of the VT level hierarchy sits the VT52. This is purely
of academic interest in 2020, but still: there is technically no way
for a “VT100 or better” terminal to be standards-compliant and <em>not</em>
support VT52 (as the VT100 spec contains a sequence for downgrading
into VT52 mode). Also, given that VT52 is a (small) subset of what the
VT100 is capable of, any reasonably well structured implementation
should find it easy to fit this in with a minimal amount of additional
code. However, of all the terminals included in this test, only xterm,
urxvt and Zutty implement VT52 mode.</p>

<h2 id="term-settings">TERM settings</h2>

<p>Another problem area for newer entrants into the terminal ecosystem is
the value of TERM set in the shell. This is a bit of a catch-22 for
all programs that are …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <p>There is nothing like having your application in production. You and your users will find bugs, surprising behavior, and new challenges in ways that simply don’t happen in any other environment. Consider the initial period of time after launch — hours or days depending on when demand stabilizes — as sacrosanct, an opportunity to focus on operations, system availability, and providing reliable service to your users.</p>

<p>Ad Hoc has been a part of many high-profile launches in government, starting with coming in to help rescue the early troubled launch of <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">HealthCare.gov</a>, to subsequent, increasingly smoother open enrollment periods for that same website, to the transformation of <a href="https://www.va.gov/">VA.gov</a>, among others. We’ve seen first-hand the stakes of getting launch wrong, and the value in doing it right.</p>

<p>In order to properly prepare for launch, take the following hard-won experiential advice into account.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Happy 2021! One of my (many) strange hobbies is to keep a list of ideas I would like to explore one day. Each year this list gets larger and my availablity gets smaller. This is why I want to share these ideas with you, hoping someone will find this inspiring and decide to create a company around it this year.</p>

<h2 id="netflix-for-podcasts">Netflix for Podcasts</h2>

<p>I’m a huge fan of podcasts. I’m currently spending an average of ~1.5 hours a day listening to podcasts. While there are lots of podcast apps, there is no one good source to recommend podcasts to listen to. Unlike movies or music, podcast episodes are not always sequential. For example, Joe Rogan may interview someone about bitcoin and in the next episode someone else about UFC. Following a person/podcast does not always make sense and sometimes you just want to follow a topic. Like some bands with only one good song, a podcast can have only one specific episode that is relevant to you. I wish I could find a place that recommends <strong>episodes</strong> not just <strong>podcasts</strong> that are relevant to my specific taste.
How? ML can be a good option. I will index all the podcasts out there (transcribe and vectorize the text) and from there try to group them based on similar interest. Also, looking at how people rate podcasts can help with this (people who loved X usually loved Y). It can be a massive capital investment upfront to transcribe all (or the most popular) podcasts, but once you have this in a text format you can monetize it later in different ways.</p>

<h2 id="stripe-for-nfc">Stripe for NFC</h2>

<p>NFC has entered our life more than ever after COVID-19. Touch-less payments are becoming the norm. Apple and Google pay work using NFC technology that allows your phone to communicate with the payment terminal. This is only one use-case of NFC. There is also a new proposal to get the NFC standard in browser as well. There can be so many more use cases: locking doors, activating devices, controlling passwords, unlocking cars, and much more. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between the hardware and software sides. And in order for NFC product to work well, developers need to have both. It’s hard to develop an NFC product end-to-end: you need to manufacture your hardware, write custom software to integrate with the NFC protocol, and then implement it on IOS, Android, and soon browsers. There is a room for NFC-as-a-service where you define your API and get a ready to install chip to start building your product.</p>

<h2 id="secret-for-voice">Secret for voice</h2>

<p>I worked at Facebook and I know the power of communities. I also understand the need for anonymity. Nowadays where everyone focuses on visual aspects (TickTock, Instagram, etc..) there is a place for bringing back voice chats for deep, meaningful conversations. When COVID-19 forces people to shelter in place, there arises a need to talk to someone about anything you’re passionate about. These conversations can be anything from politics to personal stress and relationships. Having an anonymous platform to meet and talk with people about a specific topic can be an interchange between Reddit and Podcasts. The anonymity will allow people to open up to meaningful conversations and the voice-only will prevent bad actors from exposing you stuff you don’t want to see (chat-roulette?). You don’t need to look good to talk with someone, all you need to care about is the content of your conversation. You can add a rating system to bubble up the best people so it will create an incentive for meaningful conversations and will bad the bad actors. You can also choose if you want to save this person as anonymous contact in order to chat more in the future.</p>

<h2 id="remote-first-crm">Remote-first CRM</h2>

<p>Remote is becoming the new norm. The tools for remote are anything from communication (Slack, Zoom..), to project tracking to file sharing and documentations. There is a need for an opinionated remote-first tool that aggregates everything in one place. Instead of subscribing and paying to many SaaS services, I would love to have one place that has all the needed aspects for managing a remote company. Anything from tracking projects, to chatting and calling co-workers to all-hands and happy hours. I love Ruby on Rails because it is so opinionated and I believe there is a place for an opinionated way to run a remote-first business. It will not work for everyone, but for the companies who choose to adopt this methodology, the tools will be perfectly integrated with the day-to-day execution.</p>

<h2 id="better-goodreads">Better GoodReads</h2>

<p>As someone who likes to read a lot of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90647916-sagiv-ofek">books</a>, I am in dire need of a better GoodReads. Similar to Netflix for Podcasts, I would love to have Netflix for books with a social element to it.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-service-for-craigslist">Delivery service for Craigslist</h2>

<p>You want to buy a sofa on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace? Now you need to find how to deliver it. I wish there will be a built-in service that takes care of shipping the item. For smaller packages, you can simply use UPS/FedEx but there is a pain for larger items. This service can piggyback on the marketplace as PayPal did to eBay.</p>

<h2 id="ai-for-traffic-lights">AI for traffic lights</h2>

<p>How many times have you stopped at a red-light and the road was empty? Come on, just install a smart camera that analyzes the cars around it and control the traffic better. It can be as part of a bigger “smart city” initiative but that’s a good start.</p>

<h2 id="headspace-for-work">Headspace for work</h2>

<p>I want an app on my laptop that reminds me to take a break. I want it to connect to my busy calendar and suggest times for meditation, maybe a motivational speech before a meeting, etc. I have some on my phone but I want it to be active as part of my working day and not only when I wake up or before I go to sleep. It can have an enterprise play, where companies purchase a subscription for their employees as part of a wellbeing investment.</p>

<h2 id="guided-city-bus-tours">Guided city bus tours</h2>

<p>I live in NYC where you can find those big tourist buses that drive people around and tell them about the city. This usually costs $50. I will pay $5 for an app that I can download and tells me about the city while I take a $2.75 public bus. The routes are usually the same and I would rather like to have the recording in my headphones vs the crappy megaphone. The app will record your GPS location and will tell you about where you are based on your location. Can be for walking as well as for driving.</p>

<h2 id="better-mint">Better Mint</h2>

<p>I love tracking my finances. I mostly use Mint for it. If you ever used mint.com you probably know why there is a need for something better. The UI is from the 90s, they always try to upsell you credit cards and there are not insightful suggestions. There are many new apps that try to do it today but it’s usually part of a new bank/card initiative. There is an opportunity for better tracking and analyzing tool who can give you insights on your budget and how to be more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="mortgage-over-blockchain">Mortgage over blockchain</h2>

<p>Ever tried to get a mortgage? The process is painful. First, you need to disclose your privacy and credit score, fill out tons of paperwork, and pay crazy initiation fees. Smart contracts can do it with one click. Since blockchain records your previous transactions, your credit is determined based on your loan history and not other mambo-jumbo factors. Also, your credit is anonymous so people can loan money to you based on your credit alone. There is no need for lengthy documentation as all the logic will be part of the smart-contract code. Anything from transferring money to recording payments can be done in one place (making bankers, lawyers and their fees unnecessary). There is an opportunity to set up a company that takes care of the legality aspects. Combine that with a marketplace where people can lend to others (LendingClub style) simply based on their past blockchain credit.</p>

<h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it</h2>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>React Hooks are awesome, but they are not easy to use every day.</strong></p>
<p>A guide in 11 lessons to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how hooks work</li>
<li>Master common patterns</li>
<li>Solve recurring problems</li>
<li>Use hooks at their full potential</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why this book?</h2>
<p>In my experience with React and hooks, I have faced a lot of issues, spent some time debugging to understand where these issues came from, and seen other developers make the same mistakes again and again.</p>
<p>I have also seen several developers during technical tests in job interviews getting lost when using hooks because they needed to go past the basic use of <em>useState</em> and <em>useEffect</em>.</p>
<p>This is why I wrote this guide for developers who already know and use React, maybe even hooks, but would like to use them at their full potential.</p>
<h2>100% React</h2>
<p>The idea is not to present you dozens of awesome hooks: to begin you will only need two, <em>useState</em> and <em>useEffect</em>. First, we’ll deep dive into these two, then we’ll see some others to solve specific problems. Always by using only React, no third-party libraries.</p>
<p>By buying this guide, you will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A condensed presentation of hooks and how they work,</li>
<li>Concrete common problems with several solutions to fix them,</li>
<li>Examples all along, because they are the best way to understand,</li>
<li>A list of useful online resources and third-party hooks to go deeper,</li>
<li>All in a beautifully presented document (for the PDF version).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Runnable examples</h2>
<p>The pack contains an archive will all the examples’ source code, plus the instructions to run them locally on your machine.</p>
<h2>About the author</h2>
<p>I’m Sebastien Castiel, a French developer expatriated in Montreal. I have used React for several years now, and hooks for the last two years, on several projects.</p>
<p>You can find my writings on my blog (<a href="https://scastiel.dev/">scastiel.dev</a>), or hear what I have to say on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/scastiel">@scastiel</a>). You can also say hi by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:sebastien@castiel.me">sebastien@castiel.me</a>.</p>
<h2>What if I don’t like what I bought?</h2>
<p>If you are not totally satisfied with the guide, I offer you a 30-day money-back guarantee, no question asked. Just shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:sebastien@castiel.me">sebastien@castiel.me</a>.</p>
<h2>Table of contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>Foreword</li>
<li>Lesson 1 - Store a local state with useState</li>
<li>Lesson 2 - Trigger side effects with useEffect</li>
<li>Lesson 3 - Custom hooks and classic async pattern</li>
<li>Lesson 4 - What are hooks anyway?</li>
<li>Lesson 5 - Debugging hooks</li>
<li>Lesson 6 - Get the current state when dealing with async code</li>
<li>Lesson 7 - Solving infinite loops when using useEffect</li>
<li>Lesson 8 - Optimizing performance with useMemo and useCallback</li>

            <p>Congrats! You are a digital nomad!</p>

<p>Modern laptops are unusable. Spending more than a couple of hours on a laptop leads to neck or back pain. At first, it’s just uncomfortable, but then it becomes unbearable. The laptop forces you to hunch over it while you’re supposed to be sitting straight.</p>
<p>Your neck, wrists or back will eventually be hurt. For me, it was the neck. I just had to come up with something, or I couldn’t work. The display should be at eye level so my neck wouldn’t be under constant tension, which causes pain after a while.</p>
<p>There’s no such problem with desktop computers. There are monitors on a stand, and some people treat themselves with monitor arms. But I didn’t want to bind myself to just one workplace — that was the reason I bought a laptop in the first place.</p>
<p>I like working in coffee places sometimes. I wanted to stay mobile, and I wanted to work from the same computer at home and work.
And then I found the solution: a laptop stand. There are plenty of them. I started with a cardboard one.
</p><figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/cardboard_stand.jpg" alt="Cardboard laptop stand" width="600"> 
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/on_a_stand.png" alt="Laptop on stand" width="600"> 
</figure>

<p>It does the job and you can 
<a target="_blank" href="https://mashable.com/2012/10/13/cardboard-laptop-stand-diy/">do it yourself</a><i></i> in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The more sophisticated one is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lPyB1D">Roost Stand</a><i></i>, from a former aerospace engineer. It can hold up to 20 kilograms, or 44 pounds. I upgraded to it after a while.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/roost.gif" alt="Roost Stand" width="600"> 
</figure>

<p>This solution comes with a price: You can’t use the laptop’s keyboard and touchpad anymore. You have to buy an external keyboard and external mouse/trackpad.
In addition to the laptop and power brick, here is what you end up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>laptop stand.</li>
<li>Bluetooth mouse (can be less weird than mine).</li>
<li>Bluetooth keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img src="https://grigorchuk.me/laptops/setup.jpg" width="600"> 
</figure>

<p>You end up with 1 pound (or ~500 grams) more in your backpack. You have to carry two keyboards and two pointing devices if you want to be fully mobile. Soon I realized that I do not usually work at home, and left all but my laptop at the co-working place.</p>
<p>Laptop vendors do not seem to care or even notice this problem. But the problem exists.
I’ve been at the same coworking space for a while, and within three months three people asked me about the laptop stand and where to get it — and two of them eventually got it.</p>
<p>The laptop form factor is old. It’s the same screen plus keyboard booklet that it was 40 years ago. I think it’s time to come up with something new. The manufacturer that will invent a new design can be a true pioneer.</p>
<p>I will review more solutions and suggest my own in a separate post. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><img src="https://antdke.co/parkinsons-law-graph.png" alt="" width="600"></p><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself 4 weeks to write an essay, it’ll likely take you most of, if not the whole, 4 weeks.</li>
<li>Give yourself 24 hours to write that same essay, it’ll take you less than, or the entire, 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-solution"><a href="#my-solution" aria-label="my solution permalink"></a>My Solution</h2>
<p>A solution I’ve found that works for beating this law is to <strong>set deadlines within the deadline time frame</strong>.</p>
<p>A generic example:</p>
<p>Let’s say it’s 1pm.</p>
<p>And you have until 5pm to get a task done.</p>
<p>It’s likely that your brain will make you procrastinate until you have an hour or two left.</p>
<p>What snaps you out of procrastination is the panic part of your brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much panic is bad -&gt; Anxiety</li>
<li>But a little panic is good -&gt; Alertness</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to kickstart the panic part of your brain earlier. <em>At will.</em></p>
<p>And you do that by setting a mini-deadline (let’s say 3pm) during the duration of the larger deadline (5pm).</p>
<p>And make it a real deadline. Write it down. Repeat it to yourself. Make it feel real. Replace the panic for 5pm with 3pm. Trust me, it works.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t really matter when you set your mini-deadlines or how many you set. <strong>The goal is to get you actively working earlier than the original, larger deadline.</strong> So set them how you see fit.</p>
<p>Now, by the time it’s 3pm, you’ll have gotten a huge chunk of your work done, if not half or all of it. Then, it’ll be a smoother ride to 5pm as you’ll have less work to rush through.</p>
<p>At that point, you can reset your panic to 5pm.</p>
<p>And <em>voila!</em> You’ve beaten Parkinson’s Law.</p>
<h2 id="its-scalable"><a href="#its-scalable" aria-label="its scalable permalink"></a>It’s Scalable</h2>
<p>The great thing is you can scale this solution up to work you have to do within a week’s deadline or 6 months deadline. Or even life goals with 2-10 year deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Just remember:</strong> Add solid deadlines within your deadline that will awaken the panic part of your brain early so you can get stuff done.</p>

<p>tl;dr: My ISP’s CGNAT session timeout is too short, meaning TCP keepalives gets dropped. Test if your own NAT, or your ISP’s CGN, violates <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382">RFC5382</a>‘s REQ-5 using this tool: <a href="https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test">https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test</a>.</p>



<p>I have been working from home more lately, where I have SSH sessions open to the servers that I’m working on. Often when I return to my computer, or switch to a SSH session that has been sitting idle for a while, the SSH connection is either dead or frozen. If the session is not already dead, the only way to gain control over my terminal again, is to send the ‘terminate connection’ <a href="https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/11/08/ssh-escape-sequences-aka-kill-dead-ssh-sessions/">ssh escape sequence</a> <strong>&lt;enter&gt;~.</strong> after which SSH errors like this:</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7312071c331e1a01011c01005d171c070001105d1c0114">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ 
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe</pre>



<p>This happened one day while I was transferring a VM image in the hundreds of gigabytes from one server to another using netcat like so:</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="56372239163e39252264">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ nc -l 1337 &gt; hugefile 
<a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0465706b446c6b777035">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ nc -q 1 host2 1337 &lt; hugefile</pre>



<p>This transfer would take multiple hours, and when I checked in after it should have finished, my SSH connections had died yet again. And sshd had taken netcat down with it, killing the transfer midway.</p>



<p>That’s when I decided to investigate this problem.</p>



<p>The OpenBSD and OpenSSH developers are known for their extreme focus on code quality. The chances that this problem is caused by a bug in OpenSSH are very slim. (In the same line as “It is (almost) never a compiler error.”)</p>



<p>This is probably a network problem.</p>



<p>I connected my laptop directly to my ISP’s “customer-provided equipment”: a coax modem in bridge mode. Then I ran tcpdump both on my laptop and on the server, and opened a SSH connection. After leaving it idle for about 2 1/2 hours, this is the result:</p>

<p>A SSH session does not generate any traffic, unless there’s new output or input. The same is true for TCP. That is why, after the TCP and SSH sessions have been established, no more packages are sent for a long time.</p>



<p>First thing to note, is that my laptop gets an IP in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598">Carrier-grade NAT address space 100.64.0.0/10</a>, which my ISP then translates to a public internet routable IP. (Because I don’t want to leak my public IP, I used the <a href="https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcprewrite">tcprewrite</a> tool to substitute that IP with one in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737">TEST-NET-3</a>).</p>



<p>Next thing to note, is that after about 2 hours, both the client and the server starts to send TCP-keepalive packages, but none of them come through to the other side.</p>



<p>Finally the client gives up on the TCP session, and sends a TCP reset package, which surprisingly goes through.</p>



<p>Lets see what we can find in the OpenSSH man pages about timeouts and keepalives (ssh_config(5)):</p>



<pre><strong>TCPKeepAlive</strong>
    Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.&nbsp; If they are sent, death of the
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.&nbsp; This option only uses TCP keepalives (as op‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection dies.&nbsp; As such, you proba‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bly want the ServerAliveInterval option as well.&nbsp; However, this means that connections will die if the route is down
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temporarily, and some people find it annoying.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The default is yes</strong> (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the re‐
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mote host dies.&nbsp; This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to no.&nbsp; See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keepalives.
<strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong>
    Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a mes‐
    sage through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.&nbsp; <strong>The default is 0, indicating that these</strong>
    <strong>messages will not be sent to the server</strong>, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific). </pre>



<p>So <strong>TCPKeepAlive</strong> enables keepalives handled by the TCP stack implementation (Linux in my case), whereas <strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong> enables protocol level keep-alives (handled by OpenSSH).</p>



<p>This explains the behavior we’re observing, but also raises new questions:</p>



<ol><li>Can I fix my problem by enabling the ssh protocol-level-keepalives? (ServerAliveInterval)</li><li>Why are the TCP keepalives only sent after 2 hours?</li><li>Why is my ISP dropping my TCP keepalive packages?</li></ol>



<p>I verified that by setting <strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong> to 300 (5 min), my problems disappeared. We could stop now that I found a workaround, but let’s keep digging.</p>



<p>The TCP keepalive interval on Linux is configured by <strong>net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time</strong>, which by default is set to 2 hours (7200).</p>



<pre><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="cdaca3a9a8bfbe8db8afb8a3b9b8e0a9a8bea6b9a2bd">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:~$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 7200</pre>



<p>Why is it set to two hours? We find our answer in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC1122</a>:</p>



<pre>Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
acknowledgement packets have been received for the
connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
configurable and <strong>MUST default to no less than two hours</strong>.</pre>



<p>In the following DISCUSSION section, the RFC writers elaborate on why they (in 1989) think TCP keep-alives only should be sent infrequently:</p>



<pre>The TCP specification does not include a keep-alive mechanism because it could:
(1) cause perfectly good connections to break during transient Internet failures;
(2) consume unnecessary bandwidth ("if no one is using the connection, who cares if it is still good?"); and
(3) cost money for an Internet path that charges for packets.</pre>



<p>Today the Internet is different from what it was in 1989 when they published that RFC. Now we have NAT everywhere, which is a hack that was accepted on IPv4 because the IPv4 address space is too small. The real solution is IPv6 which has a much bigger address space (2^32 vs 2^128).</p>



<p>NAT (Network Address Translation) allows many computers on a network to share the same IP. This typically works by routing your packet to a device which translates/substitutes your private <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a> IP (e.g 192.168.0.0/16) for a public one, and passes on the packet.</p>



<p>CGN (Carrier-grade NAT) is NAT run by an ISP. This allows for many customers to share a single public IP (because even with every household being assigned a single IPv4, we’re still running out). To avoid collisions with the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a> ranges, ISPs are told to use the 100.64.0.0/10 range. With this setup it is not uncommon to have 3 levels of NAT. Ex, CGN, CPE that also does NAT, and the customers own router.</p>



<p>A NAT device must keep track of which connections are made by the clients. This information is stored in the NAT table. Whenever a packet arrives from the Internet, it checks if the packet belongs to any connections in its NAT table, to figure determine which client to send the package to. If it doesn’t belong to any connections, it drops the packet.</p>



<p>This wouldn’t work if the NAT table only stored IP addresses – which client should the NAT device send the packet to if receiving a packet from a server two of its clients are connected to? That is why – unlike routers – NAT devices have to cross protocol boundaries, and look deeper inside the packet and find a “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3022">transport identifier</a>“. For TCP and UDP the identifiers used are the source and destination port numbers, and for ICMP the Query <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">Identifier</a> is usually used.</p>



<p>A NAT table looks something like this (we’ll ignore ICMP for now):</p>



<pre>PROTOCOL SRCIP       SRCPORT DSTIP          DSTPORT NEWSRCPORT IDLETIME
TCP      192.168.1.1 52264   130.225.254.99 22      52264      983
UDP      192.168.1.2 39252   8.8.8.8        53      39252      4</pre>



<p>This NAT hack unfortunately opened up Pandora’s box of problems that we are still dealing with today. For example, you can no longer initiate a connection to a computer behind NAT. The NAT device does not know which host to send the packet to. This is why NAT’ing is often equated with firewalling. It is not a feature as such. It is a side effect of the NAT hack.</p>



<p>Back when NAT was introduced, it was not uncommon for protocols to rely on the server establishing a second connection back to the client. In “Active FTP” for example, the server will initiate a new connection back to the client (the data channel) after the client has connected. For this to work the NAT must be even more protocol aware, and preemptively create a mapping for the requested port. This is the same for SIP (used for VoIP) and a few other protocols. This is why most NAT devices can be configured to be FTP and SIP aware. Exactly this feature was recently shown to be a huge security problem – you can trigger this functionality to create a mapping of your choosing from a visitors browser, and connect to any device behind the visitors NAT. Read more about the <a href="https://github.com/samyk/slipstream">NAT Slipstreaming attack here</a>.</p>



<p>For big data transfers, or latency sensitive connections (file sharing, VoIP, gaming etc) it is very much preferable to have a direct connection between hosts. But if both hosts are behind a NAT, this is not immediately possible. To solve this problem, a new hack was introduced: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389">NAT hole punching</a>, where you – by using a third-party – can trick your NAT devices to allow traffic directly between the hosts by creating a NAT table entry (“punching”) in both NATs simultaneously. It is only somewhat reliable, and works best with UDP in my experience.</p>



<p>NAT is also one of the reasons the new <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/?include_text=1">QUIC</a> protocol uses UDP packages instead of its own protocol. Too many devices will fail to handle the packet correctly if they introduced a new <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml">protocol number</a>. Where should the NAT device look for a transport identifier in an unknown protocol header?</p>



<p>Another problem that arises because of NAT is: when is it safe to remove an entry from the NAT table? Sometimes the answer is simple: when you see that the connection has been closed (e.g the TCP Normal Close Sequence). But when is it safe to remove an established TCP connection (were you haven’t yet seen the connection being closed) on which no packages have …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>For many Americans, the events of the past week have left emotions raw, tempers hot, and for some, social media accounts deactivated. </p><p>It’s a reasonable response by those who believe various social networks allowed disinformation to flourish, or worse: allowed seditious plots to metastasize on their platforms, which led to a mob storming the U.S. Capitol.</p><p>The very social platforms that are being (rightly) targeted for their role in fanning the flames of an insurrection are the same ones that drive traffic to news sites. To exist today, newsrooms have little to no choice: social platforms are a necessary evil.</p><p>The irony is astounding: a boycott protesting the spread of disinformation could be so harmful to the viability of journalism. This is why we need so desperately to detangle the fates of newsrooms from that of social platforms. </p><p>Reliable, factual updates are a requirement for an informed citizenry, and Democracy cannot function without one. &nbsp;And for an industry operating on ever decreasing margins, the page views that come from these platforms &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nillium.com/news-was-never-meant-for-social-platforms/">are keeping them alive</a>, even as the business models associated with this set up slowly kill them. &nbsp;</p><p>News is expensive. &nbsp;Long before any article is written, before any video is shot, reporters spend time on the phone, traveling to meet with sources, often to only find that there is no story there. &nbsp;They do it usually because of a passion for keeping their fellow citizens informed, for striving to uncover the truth. &nbsp;But they also have expenses, and need to be paid.</p><p>As ad dollars and traffic coalesce around a few major players online, news websites had to adapt. &nbsp;They have written ever-more catchy headlines to grab attention. The story selection has become driven by trending topics in an effort to appear at the top of newsfeeds. &nbsp;The algorithms behind such feeds make local news even harder to find because, by definition, it doesn’t appeal to the widest audience possible. &nbsp;The sites, in turn, had to make the most of what traffic they could get; covering pages in ads and trackers. &nbsp;It’s a spiral to the bottom.</p><p>But, it’s not too late to turn things around.</p><p>For those that want to make an impact, please support journalism. Subscribe to your local newspaper.</p><p>We need to think about weaning news from platforms that have such a parasitic impact. &nbsp;If we cannot find a viable model for trustworthy news online, we will be left with the only information sources that seem to be thriving now; the least credible of them all. &nbsp;</p><p>Our solution is relatively simple. &nbsp;We’re building a platform that takes the best from social media -- the concise updates, the real time streams, and the direct line of communication from reporters, but in a news-friendly way. &nbsp;Our ads appear in between updates, not tying their value to any individual click through, and revenue is shared according to the contributions to the platform, not views. &nbsp;We’re only allowing trusted journalists to post, blocking disinformation before it has a chance to root itself in our systems.</p><p>We invite you to join us, and welcome any suggestions or improvements.</p><p><em>Nillium is building Forth, a new news platform based on concise updates from trusted journalists, sharing advertising revenue with the reporters and their newsrooms. &nbsp;To sign up for our waiting list, <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">click here</a>. &nbsp; Newsrooms and independent reporters can express their interest in joining the platform <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWpLKCBdKrkOqCiaHheoOQBCvqbR3ydaCW1N1sy69RNLJGwQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.478247111=blog.nillium.com">here</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2>

<p>
Recommending a window manager is not easy, because it is also a matter of taste. We did a little non-representative poll at Mastodon and here are the results:
</p>
<div><table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td>i3          </td><td>10 Votes</td>

	<tr>

	</tr>
</tbody></table></div>

<p>
The recommendation is a mix of these poll results and <a href="https://simpletools.info/doku.php/about#our_criteria" title="about" data-wiki-id="about">our criteria</a>. Actually, we have two recommendations.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="for_beginners">For beginners</h3>
<div>

<p>
<strong>i3</strong> is not only the most popular tiling window manager in our poll, it is also the our recommendation for users who want to begin using a tiling wm. It's easy enough to start with and the configuration file is fairly understandable. In fact Fedora will release an official i3 Spin, beginning with version 34. At the same time i3 is still very lightweight.
</p>

<p>
The documentation and relatively huge community makes it also a good choice for non-expert people or other persons who don't want to spend too much time configuring.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="for_experienced_users">For experienced users</h3>
<div>

<p>
<strong>bspwm</strong> is a extremely lightweight window manager. Once you get it running by installing the example configuration files, experienced users shouldn't have too much problems to adapt it according to their needs. The concept of nodes is a little strange to get used to, but the configuration file of sxhkd is easy enough to understand. bspwm has gained some popularity in the last time, so there is also a community which can help. 
</p>

<p>
Don't like bspwm for some reasons, but still looking for a lightweight tiling wm for experienced users? Then you might want to have a look at <strong>herbstluftwm</strong>
</p>

    <section>
      
      

      <p><span>We’re witnessing a Silicon Valley exodus as the pandemic rages on and tech CEOs try to escape the city’s high taxes and left-wing politics, in search of a home base more suited to their needs.</span></p>
<p><span>The Karp-Thiel-Lonsdale Palantir trinity have all moved out of the bay area to Denver, LA, or Austin. Elon Musk moved Tesla’s headquarters to Austin, where many major tech companies already have satellite offices. Oracle relocated to Austin, as well, and Hewlett Packard recently announced it will move its global headquarters from Silicon Valley to Houston, the fourth-largest US city.</span></p>
<p><span>Texas is an appealing option for these companies, with no personal state income tax. But there are plenty of cities vying to beat out Austin in the race to become the next big tech hub.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hiring data across eight major tech companies including Google, Amazon, Paypal, Apple, Microsoft, Dell, eBay and Oracle shows a 128% increase in Austin-based job listings from last January to this month. The below chart shows significant growth beginning last summer.</span></p>

<p><span>Meanwhile, Nashville-based tech job openings soared over the last year. From January to October 2020, listings were up by almost 2,000%. (The chart below includes hiring data for Oracle, Paypal, eBay, Texas Instruments, and Alphabet, Dell, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.)</span></p>

<p><span>Nashville will soon gain 100 more jobs from the arrival of Yoshi, a former Silicon Valley company that brings field techs to people’s cars for on-the-spot servicing. Company founder Brian Frist saw the obvious tax-related benefits from the move. His father is also former Tennessee senator Bill Frist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Denver is also seeing an influx of tech workers. The soon-to-be home to Palantir’s new headquarters have also drawn eyes from Dell and Oracle, both based in Texas. Dell has increased its job listings from just one in August to 57 this month, while Oracle counts 16 openings, up ten from July. Meanwhile, Amazon counts 123 Denver-based listings. From July to now, Palantir has gone from one to seven openings in Denver. Looking at Big Tech job listings in Denver collectively, openings have shot up roughly 500%.</span></p>

<p><span>People have bet on Raleigh, North Carolina as the next big tech hub because of its affordability and growing startup scene, but our data shows the city is falling behind in terms of hiring. Over the last year, Raleigh-based tech job openings have fallen by 33%.</span></p>

<p><span>Opportunity lies in cities like Richmond, Virginia and Madison, Wisconsin. Our data shows Richmond’s big tech job listings have grown 200% since last January, led by companies like eBay and Amazon. Madison’s tech hiring boost, with openings up 100% from last year, was also helped by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span>Calling Pittsburgh a tech hub would be a big stretch, but the underdog is on its way up, assisted by job listings at Google and Amazon. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stormy-times-15-us-cities-make-jobs-happen-george-anders/">LinkedIn data</a>, Pittsburgh is number 14 on the top cities with the most opportunities for job seekers. Our data shows Google and Amazon job listings in Pittsburgh increasing by 48% and 19% over the past year, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>Then of course we have the big tech cities that are only getting bigger as they absorb Silicon Valley migrants, but the speed of growth is slowing. Amazon, which is headquartered in Seattle and currently has over 7,000 job listings in the area, has only increased its listings in the city by 4% over the past year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>That said, Apple and Oracle have increased hiring in the city significantly. Apple’s Seattle-based job listings are up by 71%, while Oracle’s have surged by 50%. From July to December of last year, Dell increased their Seattle listings by 71%. What’s more, Geekwire found that Seattle is becoming a destination for those fleeing the valley — the number of workers moving from the Bay Area to Seattle increased by 28%.</span></p>
<p><span>According to our data, Boston is a growing hotspot. Over the last two years, Boston-based job openings at tech companies like Dell, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have skyrocketed. Collectively, giant tech entities have ramped up hiring efforts in Boston by over 1,000%. Boston’s tech hiring growth peaked last year along with the pandemic. (The chart below includes hiring data for Oracle, Paypal, eBay, Texas Instruments, and Alphabet, as well as Dell, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.)</span></p>

<p><span>And then there’s Miami, where Amazon is leading an upward trend of tech hiring. According to the Information, a source who works with a person who knows Naval Ravikant, founder of tech investment site AngelList, said he heard Ravikant might be coming to Miami to “check it out.” Another person heard that Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has a meeting with Miami’s mayor, Francis Suarez.</span></p>
      

      
      <h3>About the Data:</h3>
      <p>
        Thinknum tracks companies using the information they post online, jobs, social and web traffic, product sales, and app ratings, and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue, and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.

  <p>SEC Investor Education:</p>

  <p>New Year’s Financial Resolution: Avoid too-good-to-be-true “investments” with Ponzi scheme “red flag” claims like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>“To the moon! To the mars!”</li>
    <li>“Number go up!”</li>
    <li>“Yearly return of 300+% in 2020!”</li>

</blockquote>

<p>A collection of “unpopular opinion” and get-rich-quick party spoiler “stop the music” articles on “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi? Is Bitcoin a Speculative Bubble? Is Bitcoin a Digital 21st Century Tulip Mania? Is Bitcoin Comedy Gold?”</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Prize Economists at various times, including Robert Shiller on 1 March 2014, Joseph Stiglitz on 29 November 2017, and Richard Thaler on 21 December 2017. On 29 January 2018, a noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as “a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology”, on 2 February 2018, professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the “mother of all bubbles”, and on 27 April 2018, a University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania.</p>

<p>On 4 December 2013, Alan Greenspan referred to it as a “bubble” as did George Soros on 25 January 2018. Warren Buffett called bitcoin a “mirage” on 13 March 2014.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Some “unpopular” bitcoin facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin Proof-of-Waste Mining Is an Environmental Disaster</li>
  <li>Bitcon Is a Greater Fool BagHODLer Zero-Sum Fraudsters’ Greed Fest</li>
  <li>The Bigger the Lies the Better - To the Moon! Number Go Up! Will Quadruple to $100 000 in 2021!</li>
  <li>Bitcoin Is Comedy Gold - Bitcoin Is the New Standard?! - LOL</li>
  <li>When Will the Music Stop? (Hint: Try to Cash Out)</li>
</ul>

<p>So what!?  Do your own research! Here we go:</p>

Signal Messenger LLC. is the company that makes the Signal app.
They are funded by the Signal Foundation which is a non-profit organization that relies on <a href="https://signal.org/donate/">your donations</a> to make the app free and not have ulterior motives with your data.</p><p>The foundation’s mission is</p><blockquote><p>To develop open source privacy technology that protects free expression and enables secure global communication.</p></blockquote><p>The Signal app is all <a href="https://github.com/signalapp">open source on GitHub</a> and their protocols are well documented and available <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">on their website</a>.</p><p>But that’s not why you’re here.
Let’s show you some tips to get the most out of your new secure messaging app.</p><h2 id="important-settings">Important settings</h2><p>Signal is great, but there are a few things you may want to change depending on how secure or private you want your communications.</p><h3 id="notifications">Notifications.</h3><p>You can disable what is shown in notifications to help with privacy.
Turn off whatever you don’t want shown.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-notification-content.png" alt=""></p><p>You may also want to disable the notification you get when one of your contacts join Signal.
Especially ad the rapid pace people are joining.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-contact-notifications.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3><p>You can set the Signal app to lock when your phone locks under privacy.
It may also be a good idea to enable incognito keyboard which will ask your keyboard to remove personalization while typing.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-privacy.png" alt=""></p><p>You can turn off read receipts, typing indicators, and automatic link previews under the communication settings.
Link previews only work on <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360022474332-Link-Previews">sites that use <code>https://</code></a></p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-communication-settings.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="chats-and-media">Chats and media</h3><p>In chats you can change when to auto-download files.
Some of these can be quite large so it may be a good idea to only automatically download on Wi-Fi.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-media-download.png" alt=""></p><p>At the very bottom of Chats and media is a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059752-Backup-and-Restore-Messages">message backup option</a>.
The backup is encrypted and stored locally on your phone.
If you’re using a backup service for your phone they will also be backed up to the cloud which you may or may not want (even if it’s encrypted).</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-chat-backups.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="linked-devices">Linked devices</h3><p>You can use Signal from another device including tablets and laptops.
Install the Signal app on the other device and it will show a QR code.
Open the linked devices setting and click the + button at the bottom.
Scan the QR code and you’re all set.</p><p>If you tap on an existing linked device you have the option to remove it from being able to send or receive messages.
Be aware that any existing messages on the device may still be available and cached on the device.
This setting is not a “secure wipe.”</p><h2 id="chats-and-calls">Chats and calls</h2><p>Signal chats work similarly to traditional SMS messaging apps.
You can send text, emoji, and stickers, or attach pictures, gifs (searched from giphy), files, contacts, or locations.
You can record voice messages by holding the microphone.</p><p><img src="https://www.justingarrison.com/img/signal-message-attach.png" alt=""></p><p>You can also make audio or video calls when you select a contact and click the icons in the top banner.
All calls are encrypted and can optionally go through a relay server so you do not expose your IP address to the recipient.

January 11, 2021 | https://aduros.com/blog/xterm-its-better-than-you-thought/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aduros.com/blog/xterm-its-better-than-you-thought/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    <p>(Day 10 of <a href="https://aduros.com/blog/30-days-of-blogging">30 Days of Blogging</a>)</p>
<p>A couple months back I switched my terminal from xfce4-terminal to the venerable xterm. For some
reason I always put xterm in the same bucket as xclock, xmessage, or any other prehistoric command
starting with X that comes pre-installed on any graphical Linux distribution.</p>
<p>It was surprising to learn that xterm is still very much <a href="https://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html">actively
developed</a>. Even more surprisingly, it turns out
xterm has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/">incredibly low input latency</a> compared to modern
terminals. This is easy to test at home, try typing in xterm compared to any other terminal and feel
how much snappier it is.</p>
<p>The lower latency alone is worth the price of admission in my opinion, so I went about configuring
xterm as my default terminal. The configuration goes in <code>~/.Xresources</code> and you need to run <code>xrdb ~/.Xresources</code> after every change, or <a href="https://github.com/aduros/dotfiles/blob/eab476fc62e74e46cb41bb5c094cede7a28a014f/home/.config/nvim/options.vim#L27">make vim do
it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>
<p>Here are some “modern” sensible defaults I ended up landing on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Sensible defaults
XTerm.vt100.locale: false
XTerm.vt100.utf8: true
XTerm.vt100.scrollTtyOutput: false
XTerm.vt100.scrollKey: true
XTerm.vt100.bellIsUrgent: true
XTerm.vt100.metaSendsEscape: true
</code></pre></div><p>And here are some visual styling options, not including colors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">! Styling
XTerm.vt100.faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono
XTerm.vt100.boldMode: false
XTerm.vt100.faceSize: 11
XTerm.vt100.internalBorder: 16
XTerm.borderWidth: 0
</code></pre></div><p>XTerm supports key binding, but the syntax is non-obvious:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;N: scroll-back(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;T: scroll-forw(1, halfpage) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;C: copy-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n\
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;V: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
</code></pre></div><p>This allows copying and pasting to the clipboard (not just the X selection) with shift-ctrl-C and V.
It also allows scrolling up and down with shift-ctrl-N and T (you can switch this to K and J to
match vim keys in Qwerty).</p>
<h2 id="url-handling">URL Handling</h2>
<p>So now we have a pretty usable setup, but there’s one more incredibly useful feature that was hard
to figure out: opening URLs in the browser. We could of course select the URL and copy-paste, but
there’s a better way.</p>
<p>XTerm has a configuration option called <code>printerCommand</code> which is a command that is piped all the
text currently visible in the terminal. As the name suggests, it’s meant to be used to implement
printing to physical paper, but we can save the trees and hijack it to instead scan the screen for
URLs and open the browser:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>#!/bin/sh -e
</span><span></span>
grep -Eo <span>'\bhttps?://\S+\b'</span> |
    uniq |
    ifne rofi -dmenu -i -p <span>"Open URL"</span> -auto-select |
    xargs xdg-open
</code></pre></div><p>This greps for URLs, removes consecutive duplicates with <code>uniq</code>, and displays a
<a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> menu to choose between them if there were multiple URLs.
<code>ifne</code> is included in <a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/moreutils">moreutils</a>. Put this
script in an executable file called <code>select-url</code> in your <code>$PATH</code> and then add this to <code>.Xresources</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.printerCommand: select-url

XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;W: print(noAttrs, noNewLine)
</code></pre></div><p>Now when you press shift-ctrl-W, any URL shown in the terminal will open in the browser. You don’t
have to select anything or use your mouse at all, nice!</p>
<p>Someday it would be great to improve <code>select-url</code> to also scan for email addresses. Maybe during the
next pandemic…</p>
<h2 id="peeking-at-the-alternate-screen">Peeking at the Alternate Screen</h2>
<p>Sometimes you open a fullscreen application like vim or a man page and you need to refer back to
some text on the shell. Use this keybind to toggle back and forth:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">XTerm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
    ...
    Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;H: set-altscreen(toggle)
</code></pre></div><p>You can even use it view a previously opened vim or man page after you close out of it!</p>
<h2 id="opening-new-terminals-at-the-current-directory">Opening New Terminals at the Current Directory</h2>
<p>There’s a keybind action called <code>spawn-new-terminal()</code> that can be used for this, but even better is
using <a href="https://github.com/schischi/xcwd">xcwd</a> to get the working directory of any currently focused
window. Then you can put this in your i3 config for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">bindsym $mod+Return exec --no-startup-id cd "`xcwd`" &amp;&amp; xterm
</code></pre></div><h2 id="wish-list">Wish List</h2>
<p>XTerm is missing a few small features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text reflow when the terminal is resized.</li>
<li>Fallback fonts don’t seem to always work. Maybe I’m missing a config option?</li>
<li>Transparency not natively supported. I don’t care about transparency but maybe it’s important to
some people.</li>
<li>Occasionally strange flickering with <a href="https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom">picom</a>, possibly a bug
with picom?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end this wasn’t enough to stop me from using xterm, but the lack of text reflow still irks me
from time to time. Overall, I’ve been pleasantly surprised with xterm after taking the time to
configure it.</p>

<p>The demand for fish as a source of meat increases by an average of 6% each year—making it the most rapidly growing food in the meat industry. This demand has doubled since the start of the 2000s and will double again by 2050 if the current growth rate holds.</p>
<p>Fish-farming has been expanding to meet this demand by increasing the number of fish within their facilities. However, as the fish become more closely packed: their quality of life decreases.</p>
<p>Maintaining a high quality-of-life requires the following needs to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>A low rate of sea-lice (Lepeiopthteirus Salmonis) infestation</li>
<li>low levels of the stress hormone Cortisol</li>
<li>The ideal level of food (and timed food delivery) </li>
<li>An appropriate biomass size</li>
<li>Well maintained mesh nets that keep the fish enclosed (and predators out)</li>
<li>A careful water quality balance </li>
<li>low rates of disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, quality-of-life decreases exponentially as fish-farms become depleted. This is because of the relationship between these factors and space (less space = more transference of sea-lice, disease, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="why-will-this-benefit-the-fish-farms-"><a href="#why-will-this-benefit-the-fish-farms-" aria-label="why will this benefit the fish farms  permalink"></a>WHY WILL THIS BENEFIT THE FISH FARMS? 💰</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feeding costs 60% of fisheries revenue. Unreasonable feeding can be a significant factor in revenue <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/raq.12202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de Verdal et al., 2017</a></li>
<li>Manually selecting features is a laborious, heuristic approach, and the effects highly dependent on both luck and experience (Mohanty et al., 2016)</li>
<li>DL models have shown strong stability under challenging conditions such as low light and high noise, and they perform better than do traditional artificial feature extraction methods (Sun et al., 2018)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-we-do-execute-"><a href="#how-do-we-do-execute-" aria-label="how do we do execute  permalink"></a>HOW DO WE DO EXECUTE? 🤔</h2>
<p>Most fish farms have little, if any, technological support and tight budgets. Therefore, any solution must be easy to install and low cost.</p>
<p>Our Deep Learning solution requires only one piece of equipment—a camera with measurement instruments integrated into it. One well place instrument in the center of a fish farm can collect and aggregate all of the data required to monitor the seven quality-of-life metrics mentioned above. When combined, these metrics can also produce a single overall health value of the fish farm, representing a holistic at-a-glance health rating.</p>
<p>Using the aforementioned aggregated data along with computer vision, we can develop the following Deep Learning applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea-Lice Detection</li>
<li>Behavioral Analysis of Fish</li>
<li>Dynamic Fish Appetite Estimation and Delivery </li>
<li>Biomass Measurement</li>
<li>Mesh Integrity Monitoring</li>
<li>Water Quality Monitoring and Control</li>
<li>Disease Identification and Prevention</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us briefly breakdown everything so far before we jump into the applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>we can utilize aggregated data from a single piece of equipment in <strong>seven different applications</strong>—each dedicated to a critical factor in fish quality-of-life</li>
<li>each application uses similar Deep Learning technologies but <strong>results in a unique reporting value</strong> that fish farmers can take action on</li>
<li><strong>the seven outputs can be combined in one final Deep Learning application</strong> which represents the overall health of the farm</li>
</ol>
<p>Now imagine these seven metrics, related measurements, and overall health evaluation displayed in real-time via a beautiful dashboard! 📈</p>

<h5 id="problem-it-solves"><a href="#problem-it-solves" aria-label="problem it solves permalink"></a>PROBLEM IT SOLVES</h5>
<p>Fish farms worldwide suffer from infestations of sea-lice. These parasites attach themselves to a fish host and feed off their skin/blood. The denser the fish farm—the easier it becomes for sea-lice to spread. </p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem" aria-label="how it solves the problem permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Harsh chemical treatments have become the most common method of sea-lice removal. While effective at removing sea-lice, the chemical treatment has adverse effects on the fish. It also prevents the Salmon from being sold for several weeks while they detox. </p>
<p>A deep learning solution utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision to detect/identify sea-lice before they spread over to the other fish enable farmers to take actions such as (<strong>what, moving fish populations or temporarily reducing density?</strong>) before critical population levels of sea-lice trigger a complete chemical flush. </p>
<h5 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="summary permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Sea lice can cause catastrophic damage to commercial fish-farms. If not kept in check, fish can not be sold due to lesions caused by the parasites, and in some extreme cases, lice can also cause the fish to die. Early prevention using the deep learning system can prevent harmful chemicals and keep the lice population in check.</p>

<h5 id="problem-it-solves-1"><a href="#problem-it-solves-1" aria-label="problem it solves 1 permalink"></a>PROBLEM IT SOLVES</h5>
<p>Small environment changes can rapidly increase stress levels for fish, thereby increasing quantities of the stress hormone Cortisol inside them. Cortisol alters the taste of the fish and has negative ramifications (<strong>such as what</strong>) for the consumer.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-1"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-1" aria-label="how it solves the problem 1 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>The IdTracker.ai model leverages two different CNNs to provide the capability for tracking all individual fish behaviors in small and large groups—allowing farmers to detect behavior anomalies associated with increased Cortisol. However, the challenge remains enormous since tracking individual fish behaviors involves non-rigid deformations, low image quality, and frequent occlusions.</p>
<p>Zhao et al. (2018a) has demonstrated another solution that utilizes <strong>modified motion influence maps</strong> and <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> to systematically detect, localize, and recognize unusual behaviors within a fish school.</p>
<h5 id="summary-1"><a href="#summary-1" aria-label="summary 1 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Fishes react rapidly to the smallest changes in their environment, such as Dissolved Oxygen, algae, phytoplankton, etc. If the fishes are stressed, they can produce cortisol, which affects fish meat quality. Analyzing behavior and fish swimming patterns help farmers make smarter decisions.</p>

<p>No metric has a stronger correlation to production efficiency and breeding cost than fish feeding. Feeding accounts for 60% of the average fish farm’s operations budget.</p>
<p>Insufficient feeding drastically lowers the fish breeding/biomass growth rates, while overfeeding results in wasted costs and pollution of the surrounding water environment.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-2"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-2" aria-label="how it solves the problem 2 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Nailing the optimal feeding times and delivery size can be challenging. Traditionally, farmers use simple timers and intuitive experience to make their decisions—which does not consider important environmental and nutritional factors.</p>
<p>Aggregated data containing visual information, water measurements, and historical data on fish responses to past feedings can be combined with 3D-CNN and RNN models geared for temporal/spatial data flow to generate drastically more efficient feeding. Maloy et a. utilized this dual-network approach to choose optimal feeding times that accounted for feeding and non-feeding behaviors.</p>
<h5 id="summary-2"><a href="#summary-2" aria-label="summary 2 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Many aquaculture farms have random times for feeding. Some farmers use feed based on intuition. When this happens, fish can be over or underfed. Overuse of feed leads to wasted costs and pollution of the environment, and underfeeding lower growth rates. Detecting appetite lets farmers control when to feed the fish.</p>

<h5 id="problem-it-solves-3"><a href="#problem-it-solves-3" aria-label="problem it solves 3 permalink"></a>PROBLEM IT SOLVES</h5>
<p>Estimating biomass forms the basis for sustainably managing a fish-farm as provides farmers an insight into the quantity, size, and weight of the current fish. These crucial data points also drive decision making related to feeding and behavioral management.</p>
<p>Measuring biomass can be challenging without human intervention as the fish move freely in an environment where lighting and visibility conditions can not be controlled. Depending on the depth of the fish, different degrees of occlusion and light change need to be accounted for.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-3"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-3" aria-label="how it solves the problem 3 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Two possible solutions can come together to accurately estimate biomass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Train a Deep Learning algorithm to understand the mapping between sonar and optical images</li>
<li>Segment images of individual fish, track them over time, and continuously estimate volume and weight through changes in the fish using the depth of the object within the frame. </li>
</ol>
<h5 id="summary-3"><a href="#summary-3" aria-label="summary 3 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Estimating Biomass helps Farmers make better decisions about the size, quality, and weight of fish. Currently, this process is done manually and is labor/cost-intensive. Automating this process will save farmers time and money.</p>

<p>Specially designed mesh nets fence the farmed fish into a confined area and ensure their safety/health. Farmed fish escaping the farm would be disastrous for the farm as well as the nearby ecosystem.</p>
<h5 id="how-it-solves-the-problem-4"><a href="#how-it-solves-the-problem-4" aria-label="how it solves the problem 4 permalink"></a>HOW IT SOLVES THE PROBLEM</h5>
<p>Currently, divers perform a “net integrity check” in which they SCUBA around the farm’s perimeter and check nodes in the netting for signs of wear. Hiring professional divers or owning the equipment to perform the dives can be an arduous/expensive process.</p>
<p>A deep learning neural network trained to recognize nodes in the netting can easily create rules for placement and monitoring of the mesh nets.</p>
<h5 id="summary-4"><a href="#summary-4" aria-label="summary 4 permalink"></a>SUMMARY</h5>
<p>Current Fjords and other aquaculture nets can be broken. If this happens, hundreds of thousands of fish will escape into the nearby environment devastating the ecosystem. Divers currently routinely inspect mesh nets but automating net break detection will save the farms much money and save the ocean from further harm.</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to ScheerPost</p>



<p>Shortly after WikiLeaks released <a href="https://wikileaks.org/irq/">the Iraq War Logs</a> in October 2010, which documented numerous US war crimes — including video images of the gunning down of two Reuters journalists and 10 other unarmed civilians in <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">the Collateral Murder video</a>, the routine torture of Iraqi prisoners, the covering up of thousands of civilian deaths and the killing of nearly 700 civilians that had approached too closely to US checkpoints — the towering civil rights attorneys Michael Ratner and Len Weinglass, who had defended Daniel Ellsberg in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.archives.gov/research/pentagon-papers" target="_blank">Pentagon Papers</a> case, met Julian Assange in a studio apartment in Central London, according to <a href="https://www.orbooks.com/catalog/moving-the-bar/">Ratner’s newly released memoir “Moving the Bar”</a>.</p>



<p>Assange had just returned to London from Sweden where he had attempted to create the legal framework to protect WikiLeaks’ servers in Sweden.&nbsp; Shortly after his arrival in Stockholm, his personal bank cards were blocked.&nbsp; He had no access to funds and was dependent on supporters.&nbsp; Two of these supporters were women with whom he had consensual sex.&nbsp; As he was preparing to leave, the Swedish media announced that he was wanted for questioning about allegations of rape. The women, who never accused Assange of rape, wanted him to take an STD test.&nbsp; They had approached the police about compelling him to comply. “I did not want to put any charges on Julian Assange,” texted one of them on August 20 while she was still at the police station, but “the police were keen on getting their hands on him.” She said she felt “railroaded by the police.” Within 24 hours the chief prosecutor of Stockholm took over the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; He dropped the rape accusation, stating “I don’t believe there is any reason to suspect that he has committed rape.” Assange, although not charged with a crime, cancelled his departure and remained in Sweden for another five weeks to cooperate with the investigation.&nbsp; A special prosecutor, Marianne Ny, was appointed to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct.&nbsp; Assange was granted permission to leave the country.&nbsp; He flew to Berlin.&nbsp; When Assange arrived in Berlin three encrypted laptops with documents detailing US war crimes had disappeared from his luggage.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We consider the Swedish allegations a distraction,” Ratner told Assange, according to his memoir. “We’ve read the police reports, and we believe the authorities don’t have a case. We’re here because in our view you are in much more jeopardy in the US Len [Weinglass] can explain why.”</p>



<p>Assange, Ratner recalled, remained silent.</p>



<p> “WikiLeaks and you personally are facing a battle that is both legal and political,” Weinglass told Assange. “As we learned in the Pentagon Papers case, the US government doesn’t like the truth coming out. And it doesn’t like to be humiliated. No matter if it’s Nixon or Bush or Obama, Republican or Democrat in the White House. The US government will try to stop you from publishing its ugly secrets. And if they have to destroy you and the First Amendment and the rights of publishers with you, they are willing to do it. We believe they are going to come after WikiLeaks and you, Julian, as the publisher.”</p>



<p>“Come after me for what?” asked Julian.</p>



<p>“Espionage,” Weinglass continued, according to the memoir. “They’re going to charge Bradley Manning with treason under the Espionage Act of 1917. We don’t think it applies to him because he’s a whistleblower, not a spy. And we don’t think it applies to you either because you are a publisher. But they are going to try to force Manning into implicating you as his collaborator. That’s why it’s crucial that WikiLeaks and you personally have an American criminal lawyer to represent you.”</p>



<p>Ratner and Weinglass laid out potential scenarios.</p>



<p>“The way it could happen,” Ratner said, “is that the Justice Department could convene a secret grand jury to investigate possible charges against you. It would probably be in northern Virginia, where everyone on the jury would be a current or retired CIA employee or have worked for some other part of the military-industrial complex. They would be hostile to anyone like you who’d published US government secrets. The grand jury could come up with a sealed indictment, issue a warrant for your arrest, and request extradition.”</p>



<p>“What happens if they extradite me?” asked Julian.</p>



<p>“They fly you to where the indictment is issued,” Weinglass told Assange. “Then they put you into some hellhole in solitary, and you get treated like Bradley Manning. They put you under what they call special administrative measures, which means you probably would not be allowed communication with anyone. Maybe your lawyer could go in and talk to you, but the lawyer couldn’t say anything to the press.”</p>



<p> “And it’s very, very unlikely that they would give you bail,” Ratner added.</p>



<p>“Is it easier to extradite from the UK or from Sweden?” asked Sarah Harrison, who was at the meeting.</p>



<p> “We don’t know the answer to that,” Ratner replied. “My guess is that you would probably have the most support and the best legal team in a bigger country like the UK In a smaller country like Sweden, the US can use its power to pressure the government, so it would be easier to extradite you from there. But we need to consult with a lawyer who specializes in extradition.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;Assange’s British lawyer, also at the meeting, proposed that Assange return to Sweden for further questioning.</p>



<p>“I don’t think that’s wise,” Weinglass said, “unless the Swedish government guarantees that Julian will not be extradited to another country because of his publishing work.”</p>



<p>“The problem is that Sweden doesn’t have bail,” Ratner explained. “If they put you in jail in Stockholm and the US pressures the government to extradite you, Sweden might send you immediately to the US and you’d never see the light of day again. It’s far less risky to ask the Swedish prosecutor to question you in London.”</p>

<p>The US government’s determination to extradite Assange and imprison him for life, despite the fact that Assange is not a US citizen and WikiLeaks is not a US based publication, Ratner understood from the start, will be unwavering and relentless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 132-page <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/USA-v-Assange-judgment-040121.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> (pdf) issued today in London by Judge Vanessa Baraitser of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court the court refused to grant an extradition request only because of the barbarity of the conditions under which Assange would be held while imprisoned in the US.</p>



<p>“Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at [Her Majesty’s Prison] Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr. Assange from finding a way to commit suicide,” said Baraitser, “and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.”</p>



<p>Assange is charged with violating 17 counts of the Espionage Act, along with an attempt to hack into a government computer.&nbsp; Each of the 17 counts carries a potential sentence of 10 years. The additional charge that Assange conspired to hack into a government computer has a maximum sentence of five years. The judge ominously accepted all of the charges leveled by US prosecutors against Assange — that he violated the Espionage Act by releasing classified information and was complicit in assisting his source, Chelsea Manning, in the hacking of a government computer. It is a very, very dangerous ruling for the media. And if, on appeal, and the US has already said it would appeal, the higher court is assured that Assange will be held in humane conditions, it paves the way for his extradition.</p>



<p>The publication of classified documents is not yet a crime in the United States. If Assange is extradited and convicted, it will become one. The extradition of Assange would mean the end of journalistic investigations into the inner workings of power. It would cement into place a terrifying global, corporate tyranny under which borders, nationality and law mean nothing. Once such a legal precedent is set, any publication that publishes classified material, from The New York Times to an alternative website, will be prosecuted and silenced.</p>



<p>Assange has done more than any contemporary journalist or publisher to expose the inner workings of empire and the lies and crimes of the US ruling elite.&nbsp; The deep animus towards Assange, as fierce within the Democratic Party as the Republican Party, and the cowardice of the media and watchdog groups such as PEN to defend him, mean that all he has left are courageous attorneys, such as Ratner, activists, who protested outside the court, and those few voices of conscience willing to become pariahs in his defense. </p>



<p>Ratner’s memoir, which is a profile in courage of the many dissidents, including Assange, he valiantly defended, is also a profile of courage of one of the greatest civil rights attorneys of our era. There are few people I respect more than Michael Ratner, who I accompanied to visit Assange when he was trapped in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. His memoir is not only about his lifelong fight against racial injustice, a rising corporate totalitarianism, and the crimes of empire, but is a sterling example of what it means to live the moral life.</p>



<p>Assange earned the eternal enmity of the Democratic Party establishment by publishing 70,000 hacked emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee and senior Democratic officials. The emails were copied from the accounts of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. The Podesta emails exposed the donation of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation by Saudi Arabia …</p></div></div>

</figure><h3>Decision Taken at Highest Levels of CCP</h3><p>Meanwhile, sources have said the development is a proof of China's resolve to nationalize Alibaba. Song Qing, Internet finance industry insider, said the investigation is part of CCP plans to nationalize both Ant Group and Alibaba. "There will definitely be an outcome, now that they have started the investigation ... This is probably coming from the highest levels," he told Radio Free Asia.</p><p>The suggestions are that the plan to nationalize Alibaba has come from the very top of the ruling Communist Party structure. A few days ago, the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the CCP, said the government's "anti-monopoly work" will lead to "better development." The paper said the party Politburo thought 'anti-monopoly work' should be strengthened to prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.</p><p>Song Qing agrees with the view. "Just a couple of weeks ago, they set out plans to nationalize Ant Group and Alibaba; the timing was deliberate ... Those plans all came from the central leadership," he said.</p>

    Posted on January 11, 2021
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>I have written several posts on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html">things that we got wrong in Futhark</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-12-08-why-futhark-sometimes-goes-wrong.html">why the compiler goes wrong</a>, as well as posts about <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2020-03-15-futhark-0.15.1-released.html#size-types">complicated features</a> where it is still unclear whether the feature works well enough. However, there are also some parts of Futhark’s design that I feel pretty good about! This post will discuss some of them. I will focus on very concrete details, rather than grand observations such as “bulk-parallel functional programming is a good paradigm for numerical programming”. Such doctrinal statements are more of an entire <em>thesis</em>, and require much richer and more qualified answers than just “this turned out pretty well”. Everything to follow is what I don’t <em>regret</em>, so it is necessarily subjective, but maybe other language designers will find it useful or amusing.</p>
<h2 id="short-names"><a href="#short-names" id="short-names-link" title="short-names">Short names</a></h2>
<p>Naming things is one of the two most difficult problems in computer science, and in contrast to the other two (cache invalidation and off-by-one errors), there is no tooling or theory to tell you when you pick a bad name. Matters are even graver when it comes to names that are part of public interfaces. You may well receive acclaim for fixing a subtle cache invalidation bug in old and widely used code, but do not expect similar praise if you also change the naming convention of the public API from underscores to CamelCasing along the way.</p>
<p>Futhark exposes many names, both in its command line interface and its <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/docs/prelude/">built-in libraries</a>. Many of the names have been changed over the years. When we initially fleshed out the primitive type system, I agonised over how to name the new types. Should 32-bit signed integers be <code>Int32</code> as in Haskell, or <code>i32</code> as in Rust? I worried the latter was <em>too short</em>. Yet in the end, that was the scheme we went with: <code>i8</code>/<code>i16</code>/<code>i32</code>/<code>i64</code> for the signed types, <code>u8</code>/<code>u16</code>/<code>u32</code>/<code>u64</code> for the unsigned, and <code>f32</code>/<code>f64</code> for floats.</p>
<p>Incidentally, here is a piece of advice: if you are ever agonising over some design detail that is not core to what makes your language special, and all options seem equally reasonable, just go with whatever Rust does. Odds are that whatever Rust decided was preceded by significant debate, and that whatever they picked has few gotchas. Lexical syntax is one area where this is particularly good (and easy) advice to follow.</p>
<p>But back to naming things. The terse type names turned out to work fine. In fact, I realised that <em>I have never regretted making a name too short</em>. The names I still regret tend to be those that are too imprecise or <em>too long</em> - the <code>negate</code> function in the <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code> modules should have been <code>neg</code>, for example. I am not quite sure why this is. When I code in Haskell, I have a preference for relatively verbose names for top-level definitions. In Futhark, short names just seem to fit better with the language aesthetics. Maybe that is just the nature of numerical code? I don’t know. But I definitely rely on this observation to guide future naming of things.</p>
<h2 id="file-orientation"><a href="#file-orientation" id="file-orientation-link" title="file-orientation">File orientation</a></h2>
<p>While Futhark is not designed for large programs, we still want to support multi-file programs. Code in a file <code>A</code> must be allowed to reference definitions in some other file <code>B</code>. Languages differ significantly in how they go about this. Futhark went for a particularly simple model: the declaration <code>import "foo"</code> allows access to the definitions in the file <code>foo.fut</code>, looked up relative to the importing file. That is all there is to it. If you know how a hierarchical file system works, then you know how Futhark looks up files. This is not textual inclusion as in C - each file still has to be syntactically valid on its own. We are not barbarians.</p>
<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2018-06-18-designing-a-programming-language-for-the-desert.html">The philosophical background is spelled out here</a>, but the basic rationale is that <em>nobody enjoys learning about language import mechanics</em>, and in Futhark we can get away with doing something stupidly simple. Other languages, like Haskell and Java, put more effort into decoupling the notion of a “module” or “compilation unit” from that of a physical file. Even languages that reason in terms of files usually also provide support for a “search path”, where you provide the compiler with additional directories that are searched when including files.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is that for larger programs with multiple directories of source files, a file has no unique way to be referenced (except for its absolute pathname, which is not practical), so you may need to use different relative paths in different files (e.g. <code>"../lib/foo"</code> and <code>"../../lib/foo"</code>). Another downside is that you cannot have a central repository of “system files” that are always checked (like <code>/usr/include</code> in Unix).</p>
<p>A <em>major</em> advantage of the design is that each file in a program can be processed as the “root”, without having to look for some kind of project definition file that contains necessary compiler directives such as include paths. This has allowed very lightweight zero-config tooling, such as a “go to definition” command in <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-mode">futhark-mode</a> and showing the types of variables - something that most Emacs modes definitely do not have without additional configuration.</p>
<p>Clearly this solution wouldn’t work for all languages, but it has worked really well for Futhark. I was initially worried because this design is much more similar to <em>bad</em> languages (like shell script) than to <em>good</em> languages (like Haskell), but it hasn’t caused problems yet, and I don’t recall any Futhark programmers ever being confused about how <code>import</code> works. This is the right design for Futhark, and I don’t expect to regret it any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-10-10-block-comments-are-a-bad-idea.html">These remain a bad idea</a>. Emacs has <code>M-x comment-region</code> and inferior editors likely have something similar. No regrets. In fact, my experience writing more <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-08-31-beginning-a-collection-of-futhark-examples.html">semi-syntactic tooling</a> has only strengthened my conviction. Line comments are easy to parse in an ad-hoc way, and it is particularly nice that there is only one way of writing comments.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-binding"><a href="#explicit-binding" id="explicit-binding-link" title="explicit-binding">Explicit binding</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a record type:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>type</span> t = {foo: i32, bar: bool}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a function definition we can bind variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> to the field contents as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo=a, bar=b}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And if we wish to bind variables with the same names as the fields, there is a shorthand syntax inspired by OCaml and Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> f ({foo, bar}: t) = ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>These languages also support an even more concise form:</p>

<p>This implicitly binds variables with the same names as the record fields. Futhark does <em>not</em> support this. The reason is a philosophy of never bringing names into scope unless those names are actually syntactically present at the binding site in some form. There are many things I enjoy about programming, but guessing where some variable comes from is not among them. I find C++’s policy of implicitly bringing class fields into scope inside method bodies to be particularly confusing.</p>
<p>My distaste for complex binding structure goes further: Futhark requires that all definitions occur <em>before</em> their first use. Originally this was just for implementation simplicity, but I have come to enjoy the restriction. It’s nice not to worry so much about the best definition order, because the compiler already ruled out most options. OCaml and SML have similar restrictions, so this is not <em>just</em> Futhark aping some 70s Pascal dialect.</p>
<p>The one exception to this explicitness principle is the <code>open</code> statement, which brings names from another module into scope. While a plain <code>open</code> is rare, it is used implicitly by <code>import</code>. There are also <em>local open</em> expressions, which allow us to write e.g. <code>M.(x*y+z)</code> with the names in module <code>M</code> in scope within the parenthesised expression. This is <em>really</em> convenient when writing advanced modularised numerical code, as the alternative is the much more clumsy <code>x M.* y M.+ z</code>. I am not sure how to reconcile this with our general principle, but maybe you just can’t be a fundamentalist all the time.</p>
<h2 id="no-dependencies"><a href="#no-dependencies" id="no-dependencies-link" title="no-dependencies">No dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Futhark is written in Haskell, and all of its code dependencies are either pure Haskell libraries or embed small amounts of C code. This means that it is quite easy to build the Futhark compiler - all you need is a standard Haskell build tool like <code>stack</code> or <code>cabal</code>, which is supported and documented on most operating systems. I do not recall anyone having trouble installing the compiler itself. Difficulties tend to be more in the direction of setting up GPU drivers on Linux (yet another of the great unsolved problems in computer science).</p>
<p>This policy is not all upside. For many years, we lugged around a home-brewed implementation of algebraic simplification because we were averse to native code dependencies. We also generate C code (compiled with the system C compiler) rather than interacting directly with LLVM the way <a href="http://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> does it. This means that there are some things we cannot efficiently express in our generated code. On the other hand, Accelerate’s dependency on LLVM can make it tricky to install, unless your system happens to have the right version of LLVM installed (and HPC systems and servers running <em>mature</em> versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux tend not to). <a href="https://ispc.github.io/">ISPC</a> provides compiler binaries that embed a statically linked version of LLVM - this <em>may</em> be a direction we could go in, but I suspect statically linking LLVM with a Haskell program is more tricky than linking it with C++. And frankly, I think I already spend too much time hacking on build systems and CI setups.</p>
<p>We have gone quite far with this focus on installation simplicity. For example, the <a href="https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/futhark-pkg.html">Futhark package manager</a> does not even use native code to download packages. Instead, it shells out to <code>curl</code>. This has allowed us to statically link the Futhark binary that we provide for releases, a well as not having to worry about certificate store configuration. If you can download with <code>curl</code> in the command line, then <code>futhark pkg</code> will work. And if your system requires you to configure a special proxy or whatnot, then whichever configuration files or environment variables that <code>curl</code> respects will also work for <code>futhark pkg</code>.</p>
<p>I was initially hesitant about this …</p></div></div>

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Corminaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Create:</em> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><em>Copy:</em>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>Verify:</em> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides, polymerase, and special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>Enzymes add a cap and a tail to the mRNA to protect it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore. To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE). (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with vaccines.) To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message using a Poly(A)Polymerase. New England Biolabs’ online store lists prices for <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0366-mrna-cap2-o-methyltransferase">mRNA Cap</a>, <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m2080-vaccinia-capping-system">VCE</a>, and <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0276-ecoli-poly-a-polymerase">Poly(A)Polymerase</a>.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is the main component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moderna has a proprietary molecule called Lipid SM-102. Or maybe it isn’t that proprietary, because it might be covered by a patent owned by Arbutus Biopharma.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Moderna’s <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/sites/default/files/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf">Phase 3 Clinical Study Protocol</a> defines it as “heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl) (6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate” and calls it a “proprietary ionizable lipid”. In 2018, Moderna researchers published <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdfExtended/S1525-0016(18)30118-7">a Cell paper</a> proposing 10 new lipids, of which SM-102 is number 8, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/1stClef/status/1306653592691113986">this tweet</a>. The paper has a “synthesis” section and supplementary materials which somebody more knowledgeable about such things than I might be able to reproduce. Everyone else will have to purchase it, for example from <a href="https://organixinc.com/lipids/atx001-crrdc-b9dnh-phs3e">Organix Inc at $5,000/100mg</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>PEGylated phospholipids</strong> help stabilize the LNP and protect it from early detection by our immune system. It ensures the LNPs and thus the mRNA can reach its target.
    <ul>
      <li>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0159">ALC-0159</a>.</li>
      <li>Moderna uses DMG-PEG 2000 or “1-monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol-2,3-dimyristylglycerol” with …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>Many developers think that having a critical bug in their code is the worst thing that can happen. Well, there is something much worse than that: Having a critical bug in your code and <strong>not knowing about it!</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I get notified about critical bugs as soon as possible, I started looking for ways to find anomalies in my data. I quickly found that information about these subjects tend to get very complicated, and involve a lot of ad-hoc tools and dependencies.</p>
<p>I'm not a statistician and not a data scientist, I'm just a developer. Before I introduce dependencies into my system I make sure I really can't do without them. So, <strong>using some high school level statistics and a fair knowledge of SQL, I implemented a simple anomaly detection system <em>that works</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Anomaly in a data series is a significant deviation from some reasonable value. Looking at this series of numbers for example, which number stands out?</p>
<div><pre><span></span>2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 12, 5, 3, 4
</pre></div>


<p>The number that stands out in this series is 12.</p>
<figure><img alt="Scatter plot" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-sql-anomaly-detection-scatter-plot.png"><figcaption>Scatter plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is intuitive to a human, but computer programs don't have intuition...</p>
<p>To find the anomaly in the series we first need to define what a reasonable value is, and then define how far away from this value we consider a significant deviation. A good place to start looking for a reasonable value is the mean:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>       avg</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>4.3333333333333333</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The mean is ~4.33.</p>
<p>Next, we need to define the deviation. Let's use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" rel="noopener">Standard Deviation</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>12</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>])</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>

<span>      stddev</span>
<span>────────────────────</span>
<span>3.0822070014844882</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" rel="noopener">variance</a>, which is the average squared distance from the mean. In this case it's 3.08.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined a "reasonable" value and a deviation, we can define a <em>range</em> of acceptable values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>SELECT</span>
   <span>avg</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>stddev</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>lower_bound</span><span>,</span>

<p>Using the query we found that the value 12 is outside the range of acceptable values, and identified it as an anomaly.</p>
<h3 id="understanding-z-score"><a href="#understanding-z-score">Understanding Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>Another way to represent a range of acceptable values is using a z-score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" rel="noopener">z-score, or Standard Score</a>, is the number of standard deviations from the mean. In the previous section, our acceptable range was one standard deviation from the mean, or in other words, a z-score in the range ±1:</p>

<p>Using z-score, we also identified 12 as an anomaly in this series.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-z-score"><a href="#optimizing-z-score">Optimizing Z-Score</a></h3>
<p>So far we used one standard deviation from the mean, or a z-score of ±1 to identify anomalies. Changing the z-score threshold can affect our results. For example, let's see what anomalies we identify when the z-score is greater than 0.5 and when it's greater than 3:</p>

<p>Let's see what we got:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we decreased the z-score threshold to 0.5, we identified the value 2 as an anomaly in addition to the value 12.</li>
<li>When we increased the z-score threshold to 3 we did not identify any anomaly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of our results are directly related to the parameters we set for the query. Later we'll see how using backtesting can help us identify ideal values.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-server-log"><a href="#analyzing-a-server-log">Analyzing a Server Log</a></h2>
<p>Application servers such as nginx, Apache and IIS write a lot of useful information to access logs. The data in these logs can be extremely useful in identifying anomalies.</p>
<p>We are going to analyze logs of a web application, so the data we are most interested in is the timestamp and the status code of every response from the server. To illustrate the type of insight we can draw from just this data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 500 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the server. Did you just push a new version? Is there an external service you're using that started failing in unexpected ways?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 400 status code</strong>: You may have a problem in the client. Did you change some validation logic and forgot to update the client? Did you make a change and forgot to handle backward compatibility?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 404 status code</strong>: You may have an SEO problem. Did you move some pages and forgot to set up redirects? Is there some script kiddy running a scan on your site?</li>
<li><strong>A sudden increase in 200 status code</strong>: You either have some significant legit traffic coming in, or you are under a DOS attack. Either way, you probably want to check where it's coming from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparing-the-data"><a href="#preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</a></h3>
<p>Parsing and processing logs is outside the scope of this article, so let's assume we did that and we have a table that looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>period</span> <span>timestamptz</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span>
   <span>entries</span> <span>int</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table stores the number of entries for each status code at a given period. For example, our table stores how many responses returned each status code every minute:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>server_log_summary</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>period</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>

<span>        period         │ status_code │ entries</span>
<span>───────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         200 │    4084</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         400 │      24</span>
<span>2020-08-01 18:00:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         400 │      12</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         200 │    3927</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         500 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:59:00+00 │         404 │       0</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         400 │       2</span>
<span>2020-08-01 17:58:00+00 │         200 │    3850</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that the table has a row for every minute, even if the status code was never returned in that minute. Given a table of statuses, it's very tempting to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Wrong!</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
   <span>date_trunc</span><span>(</span><span>'minute'</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>,</span>
   <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>entries</span>
<span>FROM</span>
   <span>server_log</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
   <span>period</span><span>,</span>
   <span>status_code</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is a common mistake and it can leave you with gaps in the data. Zero is a value, and it holds a significant meaning. A better approach is to create an "axis", and join to it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Correct!</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>axis</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
   <span>SELECT</span>

<p>The internet has caught fire recently on the news that President Donald Trump has been banned from Twitter and that Google banned the Parler social media app from the Google Play Store. At the time of this writing, Apple has also given Parler a 24 hour warning to increase censorship of its content or face being banned from the Apple App Store. </p>



<p>Hosting an app on a private app store like Apple’s or Google’s has always been touch and go for developers. Most recently, Unreal had a dispute with payment terms with Apple that got them banned from developing on Apple Platforms. However, in that case the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/24/fortnite-ban-unreal-engine-apple-restrained/">ban was temporarily restrained by a judge.</a></p>



<p>However, hosting an app on the open internet using cloud platforms like AWS has historically been much less open to censorship or restriction than a private app store. That has recently changed as <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">AWS has now banned Parler from operating on its cloud infrastructure.</a></p>



<p>Many people might be wondering where does this stop? Is it possible that every app I use or content creator I enjoy might just disappear overnight, never to be seen or heard from again?</p>



<p>The answer is that it depends.</p>



<p>You will never be free to hear or read what you want on closed platforms like Twitter (and yes even Parler), because those platforms exercise centralized control over their content and over the users that post content.</p>



<p>Podcasting is different!</p>



<h2>Podcasts Are Decentralized</h2>



<p>You may have heard the term “decentralized” thrown around a lot recently since Decentralized Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin brought the term to the forefront of the public zeitgeist. When it comes to podcasting, decentralization means that there is no one company or person that controls podcasting or the distribution of podcasts.</p>



<p>A podcast is made up of just two things: A file describing your podcast (description, author’s name, list of episodes, etc) and the audio files for each episode. Those files can be hosted anywhere! You can use one of MANY podcast hosting platforms like BuzzSprout or Fireside.fm, or if you prefer to do it yourself you can put Podcasts in Dropbox, your home server, on AWS, Heroku, GCloud, WordPress… anywhere you can host an audio file you can host a podcast. In fact there is a new end to end hosting solution on the market that allows you to spin up your own podcast hosting server in 5 minutes. It’s called <a href="https://podlibre.org/install-castopod-in-5mn/">Castopod and you can check it out here!</a></p>



<p>At this point you might be thinking about your favorite podcast apps and how they fit into all of this. I’ll address that in a bit, but first let’s dive a little bit deeper into what makes up a podcast.</p>



<h2>What is a Podcast, really?</h2>



<p>The No Agenda podcast currently posts a podcast RSS feed that is an open standard that <strong>any</strong> podcast player can interpret and present to anyone to listen to. The No Agenda podcast is a great example because it’s the podcast hosted by one of the originators of the Podcast standard, <a href="https://twitter.com/adamcurry?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">The Podfather – Adam Curry</a>. </p>



<p>Regardless of which podcast player you use they all read the same RSS Feed to present the No Agenda podcast to the listener. Here is the raw RSS feed that represents the NA podcast today: <a href="http://feed.nashownotes.com/rss.xml">http://feed.nashownotes.com/rss.xml</a><br>Here’s a quick break down of the information that all podcast players use to present the podcast to a podcast app.</p>



<p>At the top level of the RSS Feed below, you’ll see the basic podcast description details every podcast has at minimum</p>



<pre><code>&lt;title&gt;No Agenda&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;description&gt;A show about politics with No Agenda, by Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://noagendashow.com&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;pubDate&gt;Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:41:05 +0000&lt;/pubDate&gt;
&lt;lastBuildDate&gt;Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:41:05 +0000&lt;/lastBuildDate&gt;
&lt;image&gt;
&lt;url&gt;https://noagendaassets.com/enc/1610054980.284_na-1310-art-feed.png&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Inside the &lt;image&gt; tag above you’ll see a url. If you follow that URL you’ll find the cover art for the NA podcast: <br><a href="https://noagendaassets.com/enc/1610054980.284_na-1310-art-feed.png">https://noagendaassets.com/enc/1610054980.284_na-1310-art-feed.png</a></p>



<p>So now we have a podcast title and podcast cover art. As you can see, the details for the podcast we’ve seen so far are clear and available from the open web even directly in your web browser by clicking the links above.</p>



<p>There’s actually a lot of great information that accompanies the podcast in the RSS feed as well. Not all podcast apps make use of this information and not all podcasts actually contain the same information. Podcast RSS Feeds are a sort of controlled chaos. You don’t know exactly what you’re going to get when you open a podcast RSS feed, but you know there are a few items you will get at MINIMUM: podcast title,  list of episodes with audio enclosures and unique Ids.</p>



<p>As long as you have those basic components you can build a podcast app!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2180" height="1264" src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-09-13.07.19.gif" alt=""><figcaption>No Agenda RSS Feed</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Next, if you look inside any of the &lt;item&gt; tags that represent the episodes of the NA Podcast you’ll find a direct link to the audio for that podcast episode. </p>



<pre><code>&lt;enclosure url="https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/NA-1308-2020-12-31-Final.mp3" length="167771473" type="audio/mpeg"/&gt;</code></pre>



<p>In fact, I can embed the audio for a No Agenda podcast right here into this blog post using that link above, check it out below.</p>



<figure><audio controls="" src="https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/NA-1308-2020-12-31-Final.mp3"></audio><figcaption>https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/NA-1308-2020-12-31-Final.mp3</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pretty cool!</p>



<p>That’s basically all that any podcast app does. So now that we’ve seen the data that podcast apps consume, let’s talk about what podcast apps actually do.</p>



<h2>Podcast Apps</h2>



<p>Podcast apps take the above RSS information and process it in different ways. The No Agenda Podcast RSS feed in particular has a number of special and optional “tags” that contain information that are processed by apps that support the new Podcasting 2.0 standard <a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace">(you can read more about the Podcast 2.0 Namespace here if you’re interested)</a>. This allows podcasts to embed additional information about the podcast like: people involved, chapter jump points, funding URLs and even crypto addresses, but not all podcasts support these new features. For a list of podcast apps and hosting companies that do support these features (and which features are supported) check out: <a href="http://newpodcastapps.com/">newpodcastapps.com</a></p>



<p>Besides processing the RSS Feed information, another important role of a podcast app is to “find” the podcast feeds in the first place. This is where Podcast Databases come into play. There are only a few major podcast databases available currently and they are owned by: Apple, Google and PodcastIndex. These organizations have created what can be thought of as search engines for podcasts (or really podcast RSS feeds) on top of a “master list” of all known podcasts, that are growing every day.</p>



<p>These search APIs are important because your podcast may have an RSS feed sitting on a shared dropbox folder and it might be publicly available and ready for anyone to download it and all of your MP3 episodes… but how would anyone know where it is? They’ll know where it is because you’ll have registered it with one of the major podcast databases we mentioned earlier that podcast apps retrieve data from.</p>



<p>Apple has a special submission process that you can read about here: <a href="https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itce5b9b0782">https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itce5b9b0782</a></p>



<p>If your podcast fails the submission process for any reason, then it will not be included in the database of Apple Podcasts and any podcast apps that use the iTunes Podcast search API will not be able to find your podcast. </p>



<p>But wait… that doesn’t sound very censorship proof!? What if Apple won’t approve my podcast because they don’t like what I have to say about the latest iPhone model? If Apple controls what podcasts I can add to my podcast app then don’t they have the power to censor any podcast?</p>



<p>Well, not quite. There are a couple of protections built in to the podcast ecosystem that make podcast censorship impossible to enforce.</p>



<p>The most exciting development in recent years towards podcast freedom is <a href="https://podcastindex.org/">PodcastIndex.org</a>. Podcast Index is a free podcast database developed by Adam Curry and Dave Jones with a stated goal to: “Preserve podcasting as a platform for free speech”. As long as the Podcast Index is available there will always be a place for free speech podcasts on the internet. By the way, Podcast Index is entirely user supported, so you can help to ensure that Podcast Index is available well into the future <a href="https://podcastindex.org/">by donating here!</a></p>



<p>PodcastIndex.org is a great free speech alternative to podcast platforms like Google and Apple. However, not all podcast apps use the PodcastIndex as their search API. A podcast app is only as good as its search database. So if Apple or Google decide to exclude your podcast from their search results then users won’t be be able to search for your podcast on any apps that rely on the Google or Apple podcast search Database / API.</p>



<p>The Podcast Index also regularly <a href="https://archive.org/details/podcastindex_dump">publishes their list of podcasts RSS feeds to the Internet Archive</a> for safe keeping an open access. This means that anyone that wants to can start a new podcast index to compete with Apple’s or Google’s doesn’t have to start from square one. </p>



<h2>Adding an RSS Feed</h2>



<p>There is an additional layer of censorship protection built into most podcast apps. In fact, this feature is so fundamental that I’d say that if an app doesn’t have this feature then it’s not actually a podcast app.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="742" height="578" src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-12.23.24-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-12.23.24-AM.png 742w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-12.23.24-AM-300x234.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-12.23.24-AM-600x467.png 600w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-12.23.24-AM-500x389.png 500w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-10-at-12.23.24-AM-400x312.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px"><figcaption>Add New RSS Feed to the HyperCatcher Podcast App</figcaption></figure>



<p>That podcast RSS Feed we looked at earlier (or any for that matter) can be directly imported to the HyperCatcher podcast app as well as the Apple Podcast app and many other podcast apps (but not all… looking at you Spotify).</p>



<p>As long as this feature exists then no matter where a podcast is hosted or who hosts it, you can import it to your favorite podcast app and get notified when new episodes are available.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In a world where information and communication channels seem to be disappearing right in front of our eyes you can rest assured that your favorite podcasts will survive the internet purge …</p></div></div>

<p>Back in 2016 I did a project where I released something of value every week for 12 weeks. I called it <a href="https://www.joeldare.com/wiki/the_passive_income_experiment">The Passive Income Experiment</a>. It wasn’t financially successful, but I created a couple products that I still use regularly. I also launched 10 things that were terrible ideas.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I took the Future Founders School offered free by YC. One of the things they say to do is launch over and over again. I’m not sure which project to work on, so I’ll be taking this advice and launching <em>something</em> every week in 2021.</p>

<p>Until I heard this advice, I was really thinking about a launch as a single event in history. I’m fairly sure it’s one of the reasons none of my ideas really stick and a reason I feel like I don’t stick with an idea for very long.</p>

<p>I already have a few applications and some small books that I could launch again, so I’m going to use those for the quick and dirty launches I’ll use to meet my goals this time and I’ll create a few new projects along the way too.</p>

<p>Maybe something will stick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So far I’ve only launched on Hacker News, because it’s probably my favorite platform at the moment, but the rules ask you not to use it primarily for promotion, so I’m planning to spread my releases around and try lots of different platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my list of launches for 2021 so far.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://ponder.joeldare.com/">Ponder</a> on Show HN - January 8th</li>
  <li><a href="https://calories.joeldare.com/">Calories</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25729026">Show HN</a> - January 11th</li>

January 11, 2021 | https://carter.sande.duodecima.technology/decentralized-wishlist/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carter.sande.duodecima.technology/decentralized-wishlist/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
  Social networks are usually run by single central organizations.
  When you visit <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, for example, your computer talks to servers located in giant datacenters owned by a company called “Facebook, Inc.”.
  In addition to running all the servers and networking equipment, Facebook, Inc. also does things like control who’s allowed to use the website, pick trending topics, and tweak the algorithm that decides what shows up in your feed.
</p>
<p>
  Lately, though, there’s been some interest in <em>decentralized social networks</em>.
  These systems let lots of different people and groups run parts of the service.
  (Often, they’re set up so that anyone can join in just by running a special program on their computer.)
  I’ve been seeing projects like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>,  and <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a> get released and slowly gain in popularity over the past few years. If you want to stretch the definition of “social network”, there’s also <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://dat.foundation/">Dat</a>, and <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
</p>
<p>
  These kinds of projects are exciting to me because they could solve a lot of the problems with social networks.
  It’s a lot harder for decentralized networks to go down, or make user-hostile changes, or submit to pressure from authoritarian regimes.
  They’re also kind of cool from a technical perspective.
  Despite all this, I haven’t found a project that I personally want to use or recommend to people yet—every decentralized social network I’ve looked at is missing something or other.
</p>
<p>
  I think I’ve managed to boil down the things I want to see in a decentralized network into three key features:
</p>
<h2>Network-layer anonymity (like <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> or <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en">Tor Onion Services</a>)</h2>
<p>
  When your computer talks to a website, that website receives your IP address.
  There’s a very good technical reason for this: if you ask the website to send you some information, the website needs to know where to send it.
  (A bit like a return address on a letter.)
  But IP addresses can also reveal information about you.
  They usually indicate roughly where you live and who your Internet Service Provider is, and they can be used to connect multiple online accounts/posts/views back to the same person.
  Hackers can also use your IP address to send things like DDOS attacks your way.
  On centralized networks, though, this isn’t the biggest problem in the world—Facebook already has lots of information about you, and they probably aren’t going to DDOS their own users.
</p>
<p>
  But in some decentralized social networks, <em>random other users of the network</em> get your IP address and can link it to your activity.
  They can build websites like <a href="https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/">iknowwhatyoudownload.com</a>, which lets you look up anyone’s BitTorrent activity if you know their IP address.
  These random people aren’t even bound by the flimsy privacy policies and PR considerations that Facebook is—they can do whatever they want with the information.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, there are techniques that decentralized networks can use to avoid this.
  I’m not an expert on the subject, but systems like I2P or Tor seem to work by sending data through multiple other nodes in the network before it reaches its final destination.
  You can use encryption to make sure none of the intermediate nodes can see the data, and you can make sure that the destination only knows who the last intermediate node is and not who the original sender is.
</p><p>
  This doesn’t mean that the actual posts or users of the service have to be anonymous—you can definitely implement things like user profiles.
  It just means not leaking users’ IP addresses.
</p>
<h2>Grassroots content delivery (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>)</h2>
<p>
  Hosting data on the Internet isn’t free.
  You have to buy hard drives, and you have to pay for electricity and Internet access.
  Usually, whoever owns the website pays to host it; I spend a few dollars each month from my salary, and Facebook spends tens of millions of dollars that they get from <strike>secret backroom deals with the Illuminati</strike> advertising.
  But the whole point of decentralization is that no single person or company owns the website!
  So who pays for it?
</p>
<p>
  Some decentralized networks try to solve this problem with cryptocurrency schemes, but this means that anyone who wants to try out the network has to put their credit card information into a sketchy website and transfer money to a sketchy offshore bank account and do other sketchy cryptocurrency stuff.
  (Also, cryptocurrencies are usually outright scams.)
  Other decentralized networks have “instances” which one person pays for and a bunch of other people can use.
  But instances have a single point of failure: if the person who runs the instance decides to shut it down, all of the accounts and posts and stuff on that instance are gone forever.
</p>
<p>
  The solution I like the best is to let anyone host anything they want.
  If Bob really likes my posts and want to help keep them online, he can set up his own little server and copy all my posts to it.
  Then, when someone wants to view my posts, their computer will search for anyone who has them and ask for a copy.
  Could be me, could be Bob, could be the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>.
  Their computer downloads the posts and uses cryptographic hashes/signatures to make sure no one tampered with them.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of “grassroots” system has some huge advantages.
  Posts that are more popular will get hosted more; if lots of people want to see something, there’ll be lots of network bandwidth available to show it to them.
  And all it takes is one person who cares to keep something alive on the network, even if the person who originally created it isn’t around anymore.
</p>
<h2>Customizable moderation (like <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists">uBlock Origin</a>)</h2>
<p>
  Social networks need some kind of moderation to make sure your feed isn’t filled with spam, or viruses, or other harmful content.
  Companies like Facebook handle this in two ways: by developing machine-learning algorithms to try and automatically detect bad stuff, and by hiring huge teams of human moderators to try and detect it manually.
  But both machine-learning algorithms and people make mistakes sometimes.
  And even if they don’t, they’re still a single point of failure—if Facebook, Inc. goes out of business, or doesn’t speak your language, or decides it’s not worth allowing memes that upset the Chinese government, you’re kind of outta luck.
</p>
<p>
  It might be tempting to try and solve these issues by going in the complete opposite direction: no moderation whatsoever.
  But then you’re stuck with the original problem of your feed being filled with harmful content!
  If a totally unmoderated platform isn’t overrun with spam yet, that just means it isn’t popular enough for spammers to notice it.
</p>
<p>
  Ad blockers are faced with a similar problem, and they’ve found a very good middle-ground solution.
  If you open uBlock Origin’s settings page, there’s a “Filter lists” tab where you can choose which people’s rules to use.
  (Each rule is the name of one specific website or advertisement to block.)
  There are some filter lists that almost everyone uses, like <a href="https://easylist.to/">EasyList and EasyPrivacy</a>, and there are some that are more niche or regional, like <a href="https://github.com/lassekongo83/Frellwits-filter-lists">Frellwit’s Swedish Filter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/olegwukr/polish-privacy-filters" lang="pl">Oficjalne polskie filtry przeciwko alertom o Adblocku</a>.
  You can also write your own rules, both to block things that EasyList missed and to <em>un</em>-block things that EasyList blocked by mistake.
</p>
<p>
  Content moderation on a social network could work in a very similar way, with different groups of moderators creating different lists of banned users and deleted posts.
  You could have lists almost everyone uses that block things like spam, and you could also have lists for more controversial stuff like adult content and criticism of the Chinese government.
  And sort of like how “shared blocklists” work on Twitter, smaller groups could create their own lists of users and posts to ban.
</p>
<p>
  But if someone really needed to see a post that had been deleted by a moderator—like if they were worried it contained their personal information or threats against them—they could manually override that block.
  (They’d be able to see it, but it wouldn’t affect anyone else.)
</p>

<p>
  Put together, I think these three features would be really powerful for a decentralized social network.
  If you know of a project that offers all three of these, or you’re working on one, please let me know by emailing <a href="mailto:carter.sande@duodecima.technology">carter<wbr>.sande@<wbr>duodecima<wbr>.technology</a>.
  I’d be really excited to hear about it and try it out for myself!
  And hopefully, lots of other people would be too.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>From the invention of the steam engine, to incandescent light, to radio, computation, and the internet, a familiar story unfolds:</p><p>In a small pocket of the world, a group of people produce immense innovation, changing the world as we know it.</p><p>Different times, different places, same story. If anything, “changing the world as we know it” is an understatement. It might be fairer to say that the <em>majority</em> of the wealth and security that we enjoy today, comes from these little pockets. </p><p>Without the steam engine, or electricity, or computers, our world would be different in kind. Many more people would be burdened by toil, many an idea would be impossible, and many a person would be dead from disease. It boggles the mind to think that these innovations took place in areas no larger than a few neighborhood blocks.</p><p>The latest place, of course, was Silicon Valley. From Intel, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Netscape, to Amazon, to Google, technology invented here continues to ripple around the world. </p><p>But, we’re facing some dangerous headwinds.</p><p>The ingredients that made Silicon Valley prosperous are beginning to disappear. For the young and ambitious hacker, it’s unaffordable to live there, and the cultural atmosphere has become stifling.</p><p>Yet our need for innovation has never been greater. From centralization to addiction, Big Tech itself has produced second order-consequences. We need solutions that protect the future of our society. And this pales in comparison to the largest problem at hand: we still have billions of people below the poverty line. There is no way for everyone to enjoy the standard of living that western people enjoy, without massive changes in technology.  </p><p>This is both daunting, and thrilling. We have big problems ahead, but humanity has managed to solve them time and time again. What are we going to do now?</p><p>One way, is to proliferate the ideas that made these areas of innovation so special. Can we reverse the trend in Silicon Valley? Even better, what if we had one thousand more Silicon Valleys of 2003, or Pittsburgs of the 1880s, or the Londons and Paris’ of the 1700s? </p><p>Throughout my life I’ve lived in about 5 cities across 3 continents, with at least 4 starkly different societal structures. Most recently I spent 6 years in Silicon Valley, where I was lucky enough to experience some of what made this place so special. </p><p>When I reflect, there are certainly ingredients I’ve noticed that made Silicon Valley stand apart from any other place I’ve lived in. I want to share them with you.</p><p>The most important ingredient I noticed was risk appetite, and a love for risk takers. </p><p>It’s surprising this isn’t a standard thing. Don’t we all respect Elon Musk? Sort of. We respect the successes, but our revealed preferences show something different. </p><p>Here’s how you can tell:  Pick a city, and ask the average student what they want to do after they graduate.</p><p>Most will say they want a prestigious job at a big company. In some even more unfortunate places, it’s that they want a prestigious and cushy job…in politics. </p><p>This doesn’t bode well for their risk appetite. But can you blame them? Imagine if the same undergraduate student has a love interest. What would the grandma say if they found out that the suitor wants to “make a rocket that flies to the moon?”. How would this suitor compare to the “deputy director of X bank”?</p><p>This attitude is shared across continents and cultures, revealing a generally conservative cultural attitude towards risk.</p><p>Now, it does vary. Being different is bad but not terrible in Germany, while it’s unbearable in Japan. Yet, by and large most places are on the “still bad” side of the spectrum.</p><p>Why does it happen this way? There may be good cultural reasons. For most of our history there was little variation in productivity. Being different didn’t get you much, outside of potential exile. </p><p>But things have changed. Technology brings extreme variation in productivity. Innovation necessarily lies in doing what hasn’t been done before. And there’s a reason why many good things <em>haven’t</em> been done before: either they look dumb, foolish, or impossible.</p><p>To exploit those opportunities, you need talented people “foolish” enough to try to build on these opportunities, and capitalists “foolish” enough to invest money in them. </p><p>Conservative risk outlooks make this impossible. It’s frustrating to see. Outside of the stigma, there isn’t much downside for the talented undergraduate student — they don’t have kids to support. And likewise for the capitalist — the amount to invest is insignificant. Just when life is the <em>least</em> risky for both, stigma prevents their action.</p><p>This is not the case in Silicon Valley. Starting a startup, even failing, only makes you a better engineer and a better candidate for greater things here. And there’s no shortage of angel investors who are ready to make a bet and write it off completely, if they believe in the slightest chance of upside. </p><p>Why? Because ambition is lauded here. </p><p>When you say you want to get to the moon, people take you seriously. An environment like that nourishes the adventurer in a person’s soul. </p><p>So, what do we do? How do we bring this kind of risk loving attitude to different cultures? </p><p>I think it’s going to be hard, but it’s not impossible. Ideas tend to spread non-linearly. </p><p>What kind of content is available in your society? Are there gripping case studies that you can share? Can you build up small pockets of like-minded people? How can you make an ambitious outlook virtuous and laudable?</p><p>Whichever city can solve for these questions, has a gold-mine on their hands. </p><p>Risk appetite, however, has a necessary side effect. </p><p>Innovation requires thinking up unintuitive ideas. You have to question the status quo. A common question you need ask is: why does X <em>really</em> have to be this way? </p><p>Well, ask this questions enough times, and you’ll discover an idea that’s unpopular in whatever zeitgeist you live in. What do you do if you have an idea like that? </p><p>In some places, the penalty is so severe, that it’s dangerous to even think of an idea like this, let alone say it. </p><p>And this becomes tragic, because when you silence dissenting ideas, you stop innovation too. There is no way to follow innovative reasoning without some dissenting ideas popping up.</p><p>When you realize this, it’s no surprise that most pockets of innovation tended to stem from western cultures. Freedom of speech, common law courts, and liberty from oppression gives a person the necessary space to think.</p><p>One kicker is, that space is unbelievably attractive to a thinker: to let your mind roam is thrilling. This means that spaces like this build on themselves: people want to move there.</p><p>So, you need civil freedoms. But you can’t stop there. You need freedom to think, but you also need freedom to <em>build</em>. </p><p>This requires an open regulatory environment. If regulation is too restrictive, it selects for the kind of company that can make it through legal hurdles: large, bureaucratic, and lawyered up. Small, innovative startups that are likely to fail will die at birth.</p><p>How do you know if your city has an enough regulatory environment? Here’s how you can tell. </p><p>Just answer these questions: How quickly can you incorporate a business? Can you hire and fire someone easily? Can you accept payments easily? What kind of permits do you need to work on crypto, autonomous driving, or drones? </p><p>If you answered in the negative, this is a bottleneck for forming a pocket of innovation in your city. Each question you answer in the positive improves your city’s chances by a magnitude. If you answer entirely in the positive, you have a city that looks incredibly attractive to great thinkers and great doers.</p><p>The most critical remaining ingredient is talent. Technology is the medium of innovation, and it requires deep expertise. So how do you get these experts? Let’s put ourselves in the mind of these experts. </p><p>One immediate upside they’ll see already, is that your city has an environment where they can think freely, and it’s possible for them to try ambitious ideas without stigma.  That’s already an unbelievably attractive proposition. </p><p>But this itself isn’t enough for talent to flourish. Talent looks for other talent. Great thinkers want to be around other great thinkers. From Princeton to Bell Labs to Palo Alto, innovators clump together. So, you need to manufacture such a clump. How could you do it? </p><p>Traditionally, the solution is to nurture a great technical university. Build a place where the smartest people can gather and work on ambitious ideas. If you have that, you have a prime ingredient. </p><p>Is there anything special you need to do with this university, outside of just making admission selective? I think so. The place has to be livable enough for the professors, and fun enough for the students to stick around after.</p><p>One heuristic to know you have a city that’s livable enough, is to answer this question: Do you have any areas where folks don’t need to use cars? If you have a walkable pocket in your city, you have a place where thinkers will thrive.</p><p>Aside from investing in a good technical University, and a walkable area, what else can you do?</p><p>The most exciting development, is to turn your city into a kind of startup itself. Choose a group of technical thinkers that other hackers look up too. These are now your customers. The goal is to get them to move to your city. If you can do that, others will follow. </p><p>How do you get them to move? Well, these folks are not used to friendly governments, and are accessible on twitter. Reach out, offer to help, do the schlep work, and a movement can start. Mayor Suarez kicked this offw and has shown what’s possible. If I was a Mayor of any other city, I’d be studying this thoroughly.</p><p>If you can get a clump to form, now you have tinder. All you need to do is to add spark.</p><p>That spark is capital. I put this last, because if you have all of the above, capital will flock to you. In todays world, money is starving for assets. Many an angel investor dreams of …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div>

This past weekend, on January 9th, we celebrated 10 years since <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b">the first commit to the Elixir repository</a>.

The goal of this post is to focus on the current state of some projects in the ecosystem and then briefly highlight a few of the exciting efforts coming over the next months.</p>
<h2>
Recap: The language goals</h2>
<p>
When I started working on Elixir, I personally had the ambition of using it for building scalable and robust web applications. However, I didn’t want Elixir to be tied to the web. My goal was to design an <em>extensible</em> language with a diverse ecosystem. Elixir aims to be a general purpose language and allows developers to extend it to new domains.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir is built on top of Erlang and Erlang is used for networking and distributed systems, Elixir would naturally be a good fit in those domains too, as long as I didn’t screw things up. The Erlang VM is essential to everything we do in Elixir, which is why <em>compatibility</em> has become a language goal too.</p>
<p>
I also wanted the language to be <em>productive</em>, especially by focusing on the tooling. Learning a functional programming language is a new endeavor for most developers. Consequently their first experiences getting started with the language, setting up a new project, searching for documentation, and debugging should go as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>
Extensibility, compatibility, and productivity are the goals we built the language upon.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Elixir in production</h2>
<p>
Last year we started <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/cases.html">a series of articles on companies using Elixir in production on the official website</a>. As of today, we have 7 production cases listed with more coming this year! Overall it is very exciting to see many different companies using a variety of business models and industries running Elixir in production.</p>
<p>
Companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/06/23/growing-with-elixir-at-brex/">case</a>), <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">case</a>), <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, <a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a>, and <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> have reached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">“unicorn status”</a> and rely heavily on Elixir. Startups like <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a>, <a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>, <a href="https://duffel.com/">Duffel</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/12/10/integrating-travel-with-elixir-at-duffel/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.ockam.io/">Ockam</a>, <a href="https://www.mux.com/">Mux</a>, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and <a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7</a> also use Elixir and have received funding in the last year or two. Elixir is also used within known brands and enterprises such as <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/">Bleacher Report</a>, <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">case</a>), <a href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/09/24/paas-with-elixir-at-Heroku/">case</a>), <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">TheRealReal</a>.</p>
<p>
There is also a special category of startups that run Elixir alonside an open source model, such as <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://logflare.app/">Logflare</a>, and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex.pm</a> itself. Still on the open source front, you will find projects like <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> and <a href="https://changelog.com/">Changelog</a>. There also many small scale and hobby projects that use Elixir for a productive and joyful development experience.</p>
<h2>
Recap: Diverse ecosystem</h2>
<p>
Today, Elixir has a diverse ecosystem that works on a wide range of domains and industries. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>
<h3>
Web</h3>
<p>
Most developers are familiar with using Elixir for web development thanks to <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/phoenixframework.org/">the Phoenix web framework</a>. Phoenix gained traction in the ecosystem because it was the first to fully leverage the language and the platform for building real-time applications besides the usual MVC (Model-View-Controller) offering.</p>
<p>
It all started with Phoenix Channels, as a bi-directional communication between clients and servers, and Phoenix PubSub, which uses Erlang’s distributed compatibilities to broadcast messages across nodes. As far as I know, Phoenix was the first major web framework to provide a multi-node web real-time solution completely out-of-the-box. Regardless if you are using one node or ten nodes, everything just works, with minimal configuration and dependencies.</p>
<p>
Phoenix has matured a lot since its first stable release. Phoenix v1.2 included <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Phoenix Presence</a>, that allows developers to track which users, IoT devices, etc are connected to your cluster right now. No databases or external dependencies required! This is one of the problems that look deceptively simple at first, but once you outline all scalability, performance, and fault-tolerance requirements, it <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/11/17/real-time-collaboration-with-elixir-at-slab/">becomes quite complex</a>. Luckily, Phoenix is running on a platform that excels at these problems, and I am not aware of any other framework that provides such a lean and elegant solution as part of its default stack.</p>
<p>
Most recently, <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> was released and brought new ways to build rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML, inspiring developers to attempt similar solutions for other languages and frameworks. You can read the <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript">original announcement</a> or <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">learn how to build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes</a>. As part of the <em>Live</em> family, we have also announced <a href="https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1250846714665357315">Phoenix LiveDashboard</a>, making monitoring and instrumentation a first-class citizen for Phoenix applications.</p>
<h3>
Embedded and IoT</h3>
<p>
While I always expected Elixir to shine for building web applications, I was taken by surprise when I heard about the <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves platform</a> for creating high-end embedded applications. However, once I learned their premise, it all made sense: writing embedded systems <em>is</em> complicated. Reasoning about failures is hard. So what if we could leverage the decades of lessons learnt by Erlang/OTP to design embedded applications? What if a fault on the Wi-Fi driver could be fixed by having a supervisor simply restart it? After all, the first major use of Erlang/OTP was in an embedded system, the Ericsson AXD301 ATM switch.</p>
<p>
Nerves brings the Elixir ecosystem and the battle-tested Erlang VM to edge computing, providing a rich developer experience using proven technology. Nerves started as a one step process for turning an Elixir project into a complete software image for common hardware devices. Today, Nerves is being used in production in industrial automation, machine learning, consumer electronics and more, with <a href="https://farm.bot/">Farmbot</a> (<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/08/20/embedded-elixir-at-farmbot/">case</a>) and <a href="https://www.rosepoint.com/">Rose Point Navigation</a> being two of the most notable examples.</p>
<p>
The Nerves team also created <a href="https://www.nerves-hub.org/">NervesHub</a>, a fully open-source device management system. Combining all these technologies makes Elixir a comprehensive language for building end-to-end IoT platforms.</p>
<h3>
Data ingestion and pipelines</h3>
<p>
Shortly after Elixir v1.0 was released, the Elixir Core Team and I started looking into abstractions for tackling data ingestions and data pipelines in Elixir. We ran through a couple designs until we eventually <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/07/14/announcing-genstage/">landed on GenStage</a>: a behaviour for exchanging data with back-pressure between Elixir processes and external systems. For an introduction, make sure to check out <a href="https://youtu.be/srtMWzyqdp8?t=242">my keynote introducing both GenStage and Flow</a>.</p>
<p>
Today, almost 5 years later, GenStage has been used by many industries and has become one of the factors driving Elixir adoption. For example, you can read how both <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/08/real-time-communication-at-scale-with-elixir-at-discord/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/">Change.org</a> have built systems on Elixir and GenStage that handle spikes and run at massive scale.</p>
<p>
However, GenStage was just the beginning. In 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOExnT1PYjs">we announced Broadway</a>, which is a higher-level abstraction on top of GenStage that makes building data ingestion pipelines a breeze. We originally released with Amazon SQS support. Nowadays, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Apache Kafka, and other sources (known as producers in Broadway terms) are also available.</p>
<h3>
Audio/Video streaming</h3>
<p>
Since the Erlang VM was designed for scalable network processing, one can expect to also be an excellent platform for audio and video streaming. However, if you also wanted to process and transform those streams on the fly, the situation becomes much more complicated as you likely have to integrate with native code.</p>
<p>
Luckily, the tables have turned when Erlang/OTP 20 was released a couple years ago with the so-called Dirty NIFs. The Erlang VM always had the ability to invoke native code, but this native code could not run for long, as to not interfere with the preemptive features of the Erlang runtime. Dirty NIFs allow developers to tag native code either as IO or CPU bound, which runs on specific threads. Between ports (I/O based), NIFs, Dirty NIFs, and remote nodes, developers now have many options to interface with native code with different performance and reliability guarantees. That’s exactly the foundation the <a href="http://www.membraneframework.org/">Membrane Framework</a> builds on top of.</p>
<p>
Membrane was extracted from RadioKit, a startup aiming at disrupting the radio broadcasting industry. Originally it focused on processing and mixing audio. Later, <a href="https://www.swmansion.com/">Software Mansion</a> acquired the framework and provided stable funding and a solid team to help it grow into a full-scale framework. Currently, it allows developers to process, transmit, broadcast, and transform audio and videos streams on the fly. Whether you are building a Twitch clone, a VOD application or a video conferencing system, Membrane provides a growing set of high-level abstractions and pre-made modules so you don’t have to dive into idiosyncrasies of particular codecs, protocols, and formats. </p>
<h2>
Looking ahead: what is coming in 2021</h2>
<p>
The year of 2021 looks very exciting for the Erlang Ecosystem and the Elixir community. In this section, we are going to mention some of the things we expect to see in 2021.</p>
<h3>
Erlang/OTP 24 with JIT</h3>
<p>
In September 2020, <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/2745">Lukas Larsson and the Erlang/OTP team</a> announced a JIT compiler for the Erlang VM called BeamAsm. How faster the JIT will be in practice depends on your application but the results posted in the announcement are promising. To quote Lukas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
If we run the JSON benchmarks found in the <a href="https://github.com/devinus/poison/tree/master/bench">Poison</a> or <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason/tree/master/bench">Jason</a>, BeamAsm achieves anything from 30% to 130% increase (average at about 70%) in the number of iterations per second for all Erlang/Elixir implementations. For some benchmarks, BeamAsm is even faster than the pure C implementation <a href="https://github.com/davisp/jiffy">jiffy</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
More complex applications tend to see a more moderate performance increase, for instance, RabbitMQ is able to handle 30% to 50% more messages per second depending on the scenario.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I have been running Erlang/OTP master since the JIT pull request …</p></article></div></div>

            <!-- content -->
<p>Last days, Telegram and Signal two Instant Messaging apps are increased its users after the last move of WhatsApp on the updated of its Privacy Terms and Conditions that will apply since the next 21 February for integrate data with <a href="https://breaklynews.com/social-media/facebook-have-to-sell-instagram-and-whatsapp/">Facebook</a> platform.</p>



<p>Telegram has had a good user base, however Signal had not enjoyed such popularity, until this week more than 100,000 users decided to install Signal and over 2.2 millions has been installed Telegram.</p>



<p>Telegram CEO &nbsp;Pável&nbsp;Dúrov recently reveals the secret to get that million users transits to their app is the their Success is that Telegram respect the users and WhatsApp is unable to compete in the quality and the privacy, that allow them to host more than 500 million users around the word.</p>



<h2>Signal and Telegram as the best options</h2>



<p>Signal and Telegram prove to be the best options to you, it protects your privacy and the functions that them provides is that you need.</p>



<p>You can Download Signal for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone</a> and for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Devices</a></p>



<p>Telegram Can be used on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger">Android too</a>, and there is also a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web version</a>, so, you can use anywhere.</p>



<h2>The new Terms and Conditions of WhatsApp</h2>



<p>Since last week WhatsApp began to advice the users about the new term and conditions, and they must accept in the case they want to continue to use the app since February 21.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WhatsApp New Privacy Policy Update Explained ⚡ Ye Video Bilkul Miss Mat Karna" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wRZb2WSpKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>WhatsApp app are constantly changing and testing new functions in calls, groups and even for Businesses. but now, the integration with Facebook and Instagram is a serious thing.</p>



<p>Facebook claims that the motivation to made that changes is to provide an better unified experience between the platforms:</p>



<ul><li>The new term and conditions will be more easy to read and will include services like WhatsApp Web, WhatsApp Calls and WhatsApp Desktop.</li><li>The join with Facebook on 2014: WhatsApp is part of Facebook since 2014, so is not rare that both platforms work together and share message filters, they also claim that what the user shares on WhatsApp could be shared on Facebook.</li><li>Your Messages and data is yours: Facebook claims that has developed functions to protects the privacy and security from the users: “We do no save your messages once it’ll be delivered. When the messages are encrypted, not even we can read it”.</li></ul>

<p>Do you feel your database is growing too big or too old? Hard to maintain? Well, I hope I might be able to help you a bit with that. The text you’re about to read is a real life experience of scaling a monolith database to be able to support a top 250-website (according to <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alexa.com</a>). At the moment of writing this article, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alexa.com</a> ranked <a href="https://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chess.com</a> at 215th place in the world. We’ve got over 4M unique daily users and over 7B queries hitting all our MySQL databases combined. Went from under 1M unique users a day a year ago to 1.3M in March, to over 4M at the moment, with over 8M games played each day. I know it’s no where near the biggest players on the market, but our experience could help you “fix” your monolith database, and scale it to new heights.</p>



<p>Disclosure: <em>This is my first ever article, and it’s too long as it is – but I had to cut probably as much text as you see here in order to make it actually readable. So, some things might be confusing or not well explained, and I’m sorry for that. Hit me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, and we can get into a deeper discussion.</em></p>



<p>Update: after reading a lot of comments, I’d like to add/clarify a few things. We do use caching, extensively. If we didn’t we wouldn’t survive a day. We do use Redis, often pushing it to its extremes. We’ve tested MongoDB and Vitess, but they didn’t do it for us. </p>



<h2>The state in which we were just couple of years ago</h2>



<p>Somewhere mid-2019 we’ve started noticing that our main DB cluster is slowly growing a bit too big. We had three smaller and less used databases on the side, but everything was always added to the main one. Surprisingly, it was in a fairly decent state for a database that started its life over 12 years ago. Not many unused/redundant indexes, the ones that were there were mostly good. We constantly monitored and improved heavy/slow queries. A nice chunk of data was denormalized, as well. No foreign keys, many things were done in the code itself (filtering, sorting, etc, to make sure the DB only ever uses the most efficient indexes) running on the latest version of MySQL, etc, etc. It wasn’t neglected and it evolved over time into something that did a good job for us. </p>



<p>Disclaimer: I’m not recommending anyone to do these sorts of micro-optimizations. They are working for chess.com, on its scale. We benchmark almost anything we’ve never done before, and see how it turns out, before actually implementing it. We know these work <strong>for us</strong>.</p>



<div>
<p>The biggest problem we were facing at that point in time was that altering almost any table required taking half the hosts out of rotation, run the alter there, put it back in rotation, alter the other half, put them back in. We had to do it off-peak, as taking half the hosts out during the peak time would probably result in the other half crashing. As the website was growing, old features got new improvements, so we had to run alters a lot (if you’re in the business, you know how it goes). Altering would’ve been far less stressful if we could could pull just a small set of tables out of rotation, instead of the entire DB. So, we created a 5 year plan for our main cluster (and boy, were we wrong about our timeline), in which we were to split the database into many smaller ones, and that would make things easier to maintain (we were right about this, at least). The plan assumed ~25% yearly growth, which was what we were seeing in previous years.</p>

<h2>The REAL problem appears and our plan implodes</h2>



<p>You’re all familiar with COVID-19, and how all of that went. Guess what – we weren’t really ready (or we didn’t expect it to have the impact it had on or traffic). Interest in chess exploded when (most of) Europe went into a lockdown. Fun fact – we could tell which country went into a lockdown just by looking at our registrations by country – it was so clear. And numbers skyrocketed across the board. Funnily enough, all our databases were doing fine (not great, but they handled the traffic). But at the same time we noticed that our “reports” host was constantly struggling to keep up with the production hosts (i.e., it was often 30-60 seconds behind on replication), which prompted us to analyse our replication stream and its remaining capacity. And it was close to being full, at peak traffic reaching over 95% of the capacity. At that point we knew that USA (where most of our players are from) would also go into a lock down, soon, and that would mean that our replicas wouldn’t be able to keep up with all the writes going to the master (or even if we just keep growing slowly). This would mean the end of <a href="http://www.chess.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chess.com</a>, as the code isn’t ready to handle big replication delays when reading data from replicas, and sending all the selects to master would take it down. That made our goal clear: decrease number of writes going to the main cluster, and do it as quickly as possible! This was actually part of our aforementioned plan, but that plan stretched over 5 years. Now we had just one or two months to do that. </p>



<h2>The solution</h2>



<p>How to decrease number of writes to a single DB? Sounds simple – identify tables that are written the most and rip them away from the DB. That way the number of writes handled remains the same, but they are just split into two separate streams. These can be either tables that get a lot of inserts, or not as many inserts, but with records that are frequently updated. Store them elsewhere. How to do it with no downtime? As you’d imagine – not really that simple. </p>



<p>We first identified all the tables that had most updates (inserts, deletes or updates). Most of them were nicely grouped together based on the feature for which they were used (most of game related tables would be written at a similar pace, etc), and we managed to gather a list of 10-15 tables, for 3 different website features. As soon as we started investigating them, another problem was revealed – since we can’t “join” between databases on different hosts, we would need to move as many tables as the feature used to make the project simpler (we were already aware of this, since when “the plan” first came into place, we did something similar for 3 smaller, less used tables as a PoC, and it turned out fine). </p>



<p>The 3 features we identified as high-traffic were logs (not really a feature, and not really logs, they were just poorly named), games (like you’d expect on a chess gaming platform) and puzzles. For logs we’ve found just 3 very isolated tables, which meant not a lot query/code changes were required. Similar for games, as well. But puzzles had over 15 tables to move, and the queries on those tables had lots of joins towards tables that were to remain in the main database cluster. We’ve rallied our troops, pulled over half of our backend developers, split them into teams, and started pushing on all of these in parallel. </p>



<p>It took just one week to move logs into its dedicated database, running on two hosts, which gave us some breathing space, as those had the most writes, by far. One more month to move games (which was oh so scary, as any mistake there would be a disaster, considering that’s the whole point of the website), and puzzles took over 2 months. After these, we were well under 80% of the replication capacity in the peak, which meant we had time to regroup, and plan upcoming projects a bit better.</p>



<h2>The execution</h2>



<p>So, how did we do it? </p>



<p>As you might assume, there are two sides to a project like this – code and database, and both require a lot of work. On the code side, there are a few prerequisites for a project like this one. First of all, we need some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature flag</a> (aka feature toggle) system, either internal or 3rd party. Ours is custom built, pretty extensive, and maybe a topic for another post. The bare minimum the feature flag system needs to provide is to allow or deny access to a percent of checks from 0 to 100 percent. Another really useful thing to have is a good test coverage. Our entire codebase was rewritten from scratch a few years ago, so we were lucky enough to have that, as it saved us a couple of times.</p>



<div>
<p>Between code changes and database changes, some things can be done in parallel and some require going by numbers. The easiest thing to start with is to set up the new database. All our new databases pulled from the main one (we call them partitions, and this process partitioning) end up on a 2-host setup (master and failover-master (replica)), but it can really be anything we want. On the partition cluster, we create a new database with identical schema to the one we’re trying to split (just name it according our needs, in this case the first one was named<code> logs</code>). Then a backup of the main database is imported, after which we hook up the master of the partition cluster to be a replica of the main master (this is why we need the identical schema and backup import). This way the new cluster becomes just like any main cluster replica, only with a differently named database. Then it just sits there, looking pretty, replicating traffic, and being up-to-date with the rest of the cluster while we work on the code side of this project.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>Before we started working on this project, we essentially had 2 connections open to the database from the code: read only connection hitting replicas and read/write connection pointing to the master. Both actually hitting HAProxy, to get where they need to go. First thing we did is to create a parallel set of connections, where read/write connection goes to the <code>Partition Master</code> and read-only connection to the <code>Partition Replica</code>.</p>

Maybe a topic for another post.). </em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><header></header><p>How do you send a password over the internet? You acquire a SSL certificate and let TLS do the job of securely transporting the password from client to server. Of course it’s not as cut-and-dry as I’m making it out to be, but the gist of it holds true and stood the test of time. This hasn’t always been this way though, and one incredibly popular storefront on the world wide web prefers to add a little extra to this day. I’ll be discussing Steam’s unique method of logging in their users, and go down a deep rabbit hole of fascinating implementation details.</p><h3 id="pointing-out-the-obvious">Pointing out the obvious</h3><p>I found a StackOverflow question from 2013 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582894/how-to-send-password-securely-over-http">asking how to securely send a password over HTTP</a>. The answers are pretty unanimous: get a SSL certificate. Here’s an experiment: set up your favorite traffic-capturing proxy, browse to a service you frequently use, log in with your account (or preferably a throwaway), and inspect the requests. You will most certainly find that your username and password are sent as-is in a HTTP request body. The only reason this works is because your connection to the server is encrypted using TLS.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/so-real-host.png" alt="StackOverflow user asking what to do if a webhost doesn't support SSL certificates, told to move to a real webhost"><figcaption><p>Weird to think that this used to be an issue</p></figcaption></figure><p>The internet was a different place though in the early 2010s, let alone the many years prior. We now have services like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> which issue SSL certificates free of charge for a period of three months, with automatic renewals if desired. There really wasn’t much of a way around acquiring a SSL certificate for money, but usually with extended validity and support. You could certainly argue that there is a price to be paid for the security and privacy of your users, but that didn’t stop questions like the one I linked from appearing.</p><p>Now that we all agree that TLS is important, let’s switch it up. Let’s pretend we cannot send a password over HTTPS and have to somehow make it work with plain HTTP, while also providing users with some level of security. There’s the <code>Authorization</code> header which is standardized and widely accepted. However, in conjunction with the “Basic” HTTP Authentication scheme, it provides no security if used in plain HTTP.</p><p>There are tried and tested challenge-response algorithms, most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol">SRP</a> which is designed to do password-based authentication without ever actually sending the password, but you probably have to implement them yourself and a slight oversight could cause serious harm. You could also defer authentication to an external service. “Sign in with service XYZ” is commonly used, but comes with its own ramifications. All things considered, it’s not trivial to send secrets over an inheretly insecure connection.</p><p>So when me and a friend took Steam apart in search for traces of personally identifiable information, I was surprised to see that Steam’s login page doesn’t only rely on TLS to ensure that your password stays protected.</p><h3 id="crypto-cherry-on-top">Crypto cherry on top</h3><p>Again, grab your favorite traffic-capturing proxy and navigate to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login">Steam’s login page</a>. Enter your username and password and you will (hopefully) be asked to enter a one-time token generated by your preferred two-factor authentication method. You can stop right there, because the magic I want to point out has already happened. You’ll find that pressing the login button launches a request against an odd endpoint: <code>/login/getrsakey</code>, followed by <code>/login/dologin</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/getrsa-call.png" alt="Requests to fetch script assets, acquire RSA key and perform login"><figcaption><p>All relevant assets and requests in succession</p></figcaption></figure><p>Inspect the request for <code>/login/getrsakey</code> and you’ll find a JSON-formatted response, containing fields with names that should look very familiar to anyone who’s briefly dealt with public key cryptography. You’re given a RSA public key, though the exact values might look a bit odd. It’s clear that <code>publickey_mod</code> and <code>publickey_exp</code> define the modulus and the exponent used in encryption, but the former is given in hexadecimal while the latter appears to be given in binary (I’ll get back on that later). There’s also a timestamp which has no immediately recognizable starting point. As to what the purpose of <code>token_gid</code> is, I have no clue yet.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The login page pulls some scripts on load. There is the main login handler contained in <code>login.js</code> which is completely unobfuscated, so anyone can just analyze it and find out what it does. The site also loads some additional dependencies, namely <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code>.</p><p>A quick search for the name mentioned in the first line of <code>jsbn.js</code> reveals that these two scripts are the work of <a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/">Tom Wu</a> — a MIT and Stanford graduate who likes software engineering and computer cryptography. They released <code>jsbn.js</code> and <code>rsa.js</code> as pure JavaScript implementations of arbitrary precision integers and RSA encryption/decryption respectively. You’ll also find that these libraries have had their most recent updates in 2005 and 2013 which is a bit of information I’ll come back to later. For now, just keep it in mind.</p><h3 id="going-down-the-rsabbit-hole">Going down the r(s)abbit hole</h3><p>So now that we have all relevant assets, let’s dig around in <code>login.js</code>. The code is a bit of a mess with lots of callbacks and proxied function calls, but it turns out the parts of interest can be easily condensed. In essence, the script can be boiled down to a couple of steps, each step assuming that everything went fine in the previous step.</p><ol><li>The user enters their username and password and presses the login button.</li><li><code>DoLogin</code> is called, which checks if the login mask was filled out correctly and launches a request against <code>/login/getrsakey</code>.</li><li><code>OnRSAKeyResponse</code> is called. This checks if the response is well-formed.</li><li><code>GetAuthCode</code> is called. It runs some platform-specific code in case there are any 2FA measures active on the user’s account.</li><li><code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> is called. This is where the password is encrypted using RSA and the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> is prepared and executed.</li><li><code>OnLoginResponse</code> is called. The user is logged in and redirected to the Steam storefront.</li></ol><p>The code in <code>OnAuthCodeResponse</code> shows why the requested public key is formatted the way that it is. Starting at line 387 in the source file, the modulus and exponent of the <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response are passed as-is to the RSA library. The user’s password is then encrypted with the given public key and added to the request against <code>/login/dologin</code> in the subsequent login step.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>var</span> <span>pubKey</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_mod</span><span>,</span> <span>results</span><span>.</span><span>publickey_exp</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div><p>I copied the source files onto my local machine to explore the RSA library a little bit. Both the modulus and the exponent are passed to the function <code>RSAPublicKey</code> which behaves like a constructor in the “pre-class” JavaScript era. <code>RSAPublicKey</code> simply wraps both values into instances of <code>BigInteger</code> provided by the <code>jsbn.js</code> script. It was to my surprise that the exponent is actually not represented in binary but, just like the modulus, in hexadecimal. (Also, turns out <code>0x010001</code> is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6098381/what-are-common-rsa-sign-exponent">very common encryption exponent</a> in RSA implementations.) So now it’s clear that the password encryption is based on 2048-bit RSA with an encryption exponent of 65537.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>RSA</span><span>.</span><span>getPublicKey</span><span>(</span><span>"c85ba44d5a360856..."</span> <span>/* insert your own long modulus here */</span><span>,</span> <span>"010001"</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>encryptionExponent</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; "65537"
</span><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>modulus</span><span>.</span><span>bitLength</span><span>());</span> <span>// =&gt; 2048
</span></code></pre></div><p>Moving on to the <code>timestamp</code> field. The <code>/login/getrsakey</code> response contains an <code>Expires</code> header. It references a date in the past, meaning that the response is absolutely not meant to be cached or persisted in any way. If you check back on <code>/login/getrsakey</code> over a longer period of time, you’ll notice that the public key changes ever so often and, as such, its timestamp value too. This means there’s only a limited time frame in which a certain Steam-issued RSA public key can be used to authenticate.</p><p>This becomes even more evident when examining the subsequent request against <code>/login/dologin</code>. Among many other things, it contains the username, encrypted password as well as the timestamp of the issued RSA public key. Trying to perform a login attempt while altering the timestamp fails as expected. But more importantly, it’s also not possible to reuse an older public key, even if the password is correctly encrypted.</p><p>I went one step further and <a href="https://gist.github.com/JoogsWasTaken/8a8e60859e1721255c57e9185eb6cb10">wrote a simple Python script to collect public keys</a> over the span of three days using a throwaway account. I let it run every five minutes using a cronjob. The goal was to check just how often Steam’s public keys change and to hopefully find out how the <code>timestamp</code> field behaves.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-pubkeys.png" alt="SQLite database containing public keys sourced from Steam"><figcaption><p>Lots and lots and lots of public keys</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that the public key changes every 12 entries, meaning that it’s safe to assume that they rotate every hour. The encryption exponent stays the same — no surprises here. More intriguing however is the aforementioned <code>timestamp</code> field. For every 12 public keys, the value of the <code>timestamp</code> increases by a certain amount, namely 3600000000 and then some. And what’s more is that this number wraps around after some period of time as can be seen in the following image. Be warned, because all of what I’m about to say is highly speculative.</p><figure><img src="https://owlspace.xyz/images/steam-rsa/sqlite-wraparound.png" alt="Public key entries where the timestamp value wraps around in-between"><figcaption><p>Timestamp field wrapping around</p></figcaption></figure><p>I found that 3600000000 microseconds is equal to one hour, making me assume that the value of the <code>timestamp</code> field is, in fact, given in microseconds. However, I already hinted at the fact that the timestamp value doesn’t increase by one hour exactly with every new public key. In my own data, I observed that the difference between two successive timestamps is one hour plus 1 to 2.6 seconds, with most being in the order of about 1.05 to 1.25 seconds. But this raises another interesting possibility.</p><p>Let’s assume that a new public key is generated every hour plus one second. If I query the public key …</p></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I vacillate between two modes: sometimes I think every scientific and professional field is genuinely complex, requiring years if not decades of specialization to truly understand even a small sliver of it, and the experts<span><a href="#fn5071682221" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682221">1</sup></a></span> at the apex of these fields have deep insights about their subject matter. The evidence in favor of this view seems pretty good, a quick look at the technology, health, and wealth around us ought to convince anyone.</p><p>But sometimes one of these masters at the top of the mountain will say something so obviously incorrect, something even an amateur can see is false, that the only possible explanation is that they understand very little about their field. Sometimes vaguely smart generalists with some basic stats knowledge objectively outperform these experts. And if the masters at the top of the mountain aren't real, then that undermines the entire hierarchy of expertise.</p><p>Some hierarchies are undeniably legitimate. Chess, for example, has the top players constantly battling each other, new players trying to break in (and sometimes succeeding), and it's all tracked by a transparent rating algorithm that is constantly updated. Even at the far right tails of these rankings, there are significant and undeniable skill gaps. There is simply no way Magnus Carlsen is secretly bad at chess.</p><p>Science would seem like another such hierarchy. The people at the top have passed through a long series of tests designed to evaluate their skills and knowledge, winnow out the undeserving, and provide specialized training: undergrad, PhD, tenure track position, with an armada of publications and citations along the way.</p><p>Anyone who has survived the torments of tertiary education will have had the experience of getting a broad look at a field in a 101 class, then drilling deeper into specific subfields in more advanced classes, and then into yet more specific sub-subfields in yet more advanced classes, until eventually you're stuck at home on a Saturday night reading an article in an obscure Belgian journal titled "Iron Content in Antwerp Horseshoes, 1791-1794: Trade and Equestrian Culture Under the Habsburgs", and the list of references carries the threatening implication of an entire literature on the equestrian metallurgy of the Low Countries, with academics split into factions justifying or expostulating the irreconcilable implications of rival theories. And then you realize that there's an equally obscure literature about every single subfield-of-a-subfield-of-a-subfield. You realize that you will never be a polymath and that simply catching up with the state of the art in one tiny corner of knowledge is a daunting proposition. The idea of exiting this ridiculous sham we call life flashes in your mind, but you dismiss it and heroically persist in your quest to understand those horseshoes instead.</p><p>It is absurd to think that after such lengthy studies and deep specialization the experts could be secret frauds. As absurd as the idea that Magnus Carlsen secretly can't play Chess. Right?</p><p>Imagine if tomorrow it was revealed that Magnus Carlsen actually doesn't know how to play chess. You can't then just turn to the #2 and go "oh well, Carsen was fake but at least we have Fabiano Caruana, he's the real deal"—if Carlsen is fake that also implicates every player who has played against him, every tournament organizer, and so on. The entire hierarchy comes into question. Even worse, imagine if it was revealed that Carlsen was a fake, but he still continued to be ranked #1 afterwards. So when I observe extreme credential-competence disparities in science or government bureaucracies, I begin to suspect the entire system.<span><a href="#fn5071682222" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682222">2</sup></a></span> Let's take a look at some examples.</p><h4 id="59"><a href="#59" title="59"></a>59</h4><p>In 2015, Viechtbauer et al. published <em>A simple formula for the calculation of sample size in pilot studies</em>, in which they describe a simple method for calculating the required N for an x% chance of detecting a certain effect based on the proportion of participants who exhibit the effect. In the paper, they give an <em>example</em> of such a calculation, writing that if 5% of participants exhibit a problem, the study needs N=59 for a 95% probability of detecting the problem. The actual required N will, of course, vary depending on the prevalence of the effect being studied.</p><p>If you look at the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0%2C5&amp;cites=8563214002358604992&amp;scipsc=1&amp;q=59&amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">papers citing Viechtbauer et al.</a>, you will find dozens of them simply using N=59, regardless of the problem they're studying, and explaining that they're using that sample size because of the Viechtbauer paper! The authors of these studies are professors at real universities, working in disciplines based almost entirely on statistical analyses. The papers passed through editors and peer reviewers. In <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/">my piece on the replication crisis</a>, I wrote that I find it difficult to believe that social scientists don't know what they're doing when they publish weak studies; one of the most common responses from scientists was "no, they genuinely don't understand elementary statistics". It still seems absurd (just count the years from undergrad to PhD, how do you fail to pick this stuff up just by osmosis?) but it also appears to be true. How does this happen? Can you imagine a physicist who doesn't understand basic calculus? And if this is the level of competence among tenured professors, what is going on among the people below them in the hierarchy of expertise?</p><h4 id="Masks"><a href="#Masks" title="Masks"></a>Masks</h4><p>Epidemiologists have beclowned themselves in all sorts of ways over the last year, but this is one of my favorites. Michelle Odden, professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford (to be fair she does focus on cardiovascular rather than infectious disease, but then perhaps she shouldn't appeal to her credentials):</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/experts_masks-097c3b01fdd318edec9f70415bc95d6b.jpg"></p><h4 id="Time-Diversification"><a href="#Time-Diversification" title="Time Diversification"></a>Time Diversification</h4><p>CalPERS is the largest pension fund in the United States, managing about $400 billion dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/qFIcakrlowE?t=4743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is a video of a meeting of the CalPERS investment committee, in which you will hear Chief Investment Officer Yu Meng say two incredible things:</p><ol><li>That he can pick active managers who will generate alpha, and this decreases portfolio risk.</li><li>That infrequent model-based valuation of investments makes them <em>less risky</em> compared to those traded on a market, due to "time diversification".</li></ol><p>This is utter nonsense, of course. When someone questions him, he retorts with "I might have to go back to school to get another PhD". The appeal to credentials is typical when fake expertise is questioned. Can you imagine Magnus Carlsen appealing to a piece of paper saying he has a PhD in chessology to explain why he's good?<span><a href="#fn5071682223" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682223">3</sup></a></span></p><h4 id="Feedback-Loops"><a href="#Feedback-Loops" title="Feedback Loops"></a>Feedback Loops</h4><p>It all comes down to feedback loops. The optimal environment for developing and recognizing expertise is one which allows for clear predictions and provides timely, objective feedback along with a system that promotes the use of that feedback for future improvement. Capitalism and evolution work so well because of their merciless feedback mechanisms.<span><a href="#fn5071682224" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682224">4</sup></a></span></p><p>The basic sciences have a great environment for such feedback loops: if physics was fake, CPUs wouldn't work, rockets wouldn't go to the moon, and so on. But if social priming is fake, well...? There are other factors at play, too, some of them rather nebulous: there's more to science than just running experiments and publishing stuff. Mertonian, distributed, informal community norms play a significant role in aligning prestige with real expertise, and these broader social mechanisms are the keystone that holds everything together. But such things are hard to measure and impossible to engineer. And can such an honor system persist indefinitely or will it eventually be subverted by bad actors?<span><a href="#fn5071682225" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref5071682225">5</sup></a></span></p><p>What does feedback look like in the social sciences? The norms don't seem to be operating very well. There's a small probability that your work will be replicated at some point, but really the main feedback mechanism is "impact" (in other words, citations). Since <a href="https://fantasticanachronism.com/2020/09/11/whats-wrong-with-social-science-and-how-to-fix-it/#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t">citations in the social sciences are not related to truth</a>, this is useless at best. Can you imagine if fake crank theories in physics got as many citations as the papers from CERN? Notorious fraud Brian Wansink racked up 2500 citations in 2020, two years after he was forced to resign. There's your social science feedback loop!</p><p>The feedback loops of the academy are also predicated on the current credentialed insiders <em>actually being experts</em>. But if the N=59 crew are making such ridiculous errors in their <em>own</em> papers, they obviously don't have the ability to judge <em>other</em> people's papers either, and neither do the editors and reviewers who allow such things to be published—for the feedback loop to work properly you need both the cultural norms and genuinely competent individuals to apply them.</p><p>The candidate gene literature (of which <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/07/5-httlpr-a-pointed-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5-HTTLPR</a> was a subset) is an example of feedback and successful course correction: many years and thousands of papers were wasted on something that ended up being completely untrue, and while a few of these papers still trickle in, these days the approach has been essentially abandoned and replaced by genome-wide association studies. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/17/learning-to-love-scientific-consensus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Alexander is rather sanguine</a> about the ability of scientific feedback mechanisms to eventually reach a true consensus, but I'm more skeptical. In psychology, the methodological deficiencies of today are the more or less same ones as those of the <a href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1959.10501497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the 1950s</a>, with no hope for change.</p><p>Sometimes we can't wait a decade or two for the feedback to work, the current pandemic being a good example. Being right about masks <em>eventually</em> isn't good enough. The loop there needs to be tight, feedback immediate. Blindly relying on the predictions of this or that model from this or that university is absurd. You need systems with built-in, automatic mechanisms for feedback and course correction, subsidized markets being the very best one. Tom Liptay (a superforecaster) has been <a href="https://www.maby.app/covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scoring his predictions against those of experts</a>; naturally he's winning. And that's just one person, imagine hundreds of them combined, with a monetary incentive on top.</p><h4 id="Uniformity"><a href="#Uniformity" title="Uniformity"></a>Uniformity</h4><p>There's a …</p></div></div>

Remotely, which is a fun one, we have John Graham-Cumming, who wrote The Geek Atlas. I was just looking at that this morning and The Make book that I also have, and also works at Cloudflare as the CTO.</span></p><p id="t=00:00:45" data-timecode="00:00:45"><a href="#t=00:00:45"><span>00:00:45</span></a><span><strong>John</strong> Graham-Cumming: Thank you very much. It's very nice to be able to talk to you, from far away.</span></p><p id="t=00:00:49" data-timecode="00:00:49"><a href="#t=00:00:49"><span>00:00:49</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Yes, this is a conversation we've really been looking forward to having for a long time because when you dial up computer history, which we've been known to do on this podcast, you turn the dial all the way back. Do you want to talk about how you got into Babbage and his work with Lovelace and so on?</span></p><p id="t=00:01:09" data-timecode="00:01:09"><a href="#t=00:01:09"><span>00:01:09</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Yes. I think I probably knew about it at university because it was mentioned just like, "Oh, by the way, there was this other thing, and maybe it was a computer, Charles Babbage. Then what really happened was, right at a time when I was at university in the UK, the Science Museum in London started building one of Babbage's machines, this thing called the difference engine, which is really a very big specialized calculator. It is not a computer and they started actually taking his plans and building it. Because of where I live when I was at college, and where my parents were, I used to have to travel through London.</span></p><p>I would literally go through London and sneak out of the tube, go into the Science Museum, look at this thing being built, and then slowly, it would get bigger and bigger and bigger, because they built it in public.</p><p id="t=00:01:58" data-timecode="00:01:58"><a href="#t=00:01:58"><span>00:01:58</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Oh, wow.</span></p><p id="t=00:01:59" data-timecode="00:01:59"><a href="#t=00:01:59"><span>00:01:59</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Which is really, really cool. I knew about it. I remember at one point, this is traumatic for you, taking my girlfriend who was also a mathematician to see this thing. Then the two of us like, "Okay, the method of differences, let's sit down." We sat down on, there's a little patch of grass outside the Science Museum. It's not a very grassy area, sitting down on this patch of grass on a sunny day in London. That's why I remember it.</span></p><p id="t=00:02:21" data-timecode="00:02:21"><a href="#t=00:02:21"><span>00:02:21</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Very distinctive.</span></p><p id="t=00:02:24" data-timecode="00:02:24"><a href="#t=00:02:24"><span>00:02:24</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> The two of us with a piece of paper working out, okay, how does this thing work? How does the method of differences work? That was probably really when I got excited about Babbage, and then subsequently realized that the difference engine as cool as it was, isn't actually programmable and that was a bit sad.</span></p><p id="t=00:02:40" data-timecode="00:02:40"><a href="#t=00:02:40"><span>00:02:40</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Did you already know at that point that you are interested in computing? Had you grown up in computing at that point?</span></p><p id="t=00:02:46" data-timecode="00:02:46"><a href="#t=00:02:46"><span>00:02:46</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Yes. I was doing mathematics and computation as Oxford called it because Oxford was very theoretical. It was all about the theory of computation. None of this messing around with real computers. I hadn't messed around with computers for a long time</span></p><p>because well, if you go backwards, you have to work backwards, I was obviously a child of the '80s 8-bit revolution in the UK. I had a thing called the BBC Micro which was this really cool computer with 48K RAM.</p><p id="t=00:03:14" data-timecode="00:03:14"><a href="#t=00:03:14"><span>00:03:14</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Whenever the BBC Micro is mentioned on the podcast, it's been mentioned a couple of times, I feel that all of our English listeners play God Save The Queen in the background.</span></p><p id="t=00:03:24" data-timecode="00:03:24"><a href="#t=00:03:24"><span>00:03:24</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> I feel that there is tears in the eyes.</span></p><p id="t=00:03:24" data-timecode="00:03:24"><a href="#t=00:03:24"><span>00:03:24</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Well, there were two groups, Bryan. In the UK at that time, there was the Sinclair group, ZX81, the ZX Spectrum and then there were the BBC Micro people. We were two camps and the Sinclair machines were slightly cheaper.</span></p><p id="t=00:03:43" data-timecode="00:03:43"><a href="#t=00:03:43"><span>00:03:43</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> I have got so many follow-up questions. Is this a class divide? Is it geographical? What divides these two clans?</span></p><p id="t=00:03:50" data-timecode="00:03:50"><a href="#t=00:03:50"><span>00:03:50</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> There was definitely a price difference. The Sinclair machines were much much cheaper and so I think they were much, much more widespread whereas the BBC machines were in school so you got at them at school. I ended up with the BBC machine because my parents in their wisdom, they said-- Well, they had two boys and they're like, "We'll let these two boys do the things they seem really interested in." My brother had had years and years of piano lessons and played the piano really well. I said, "I want to have a computer."</span></p><p>They said, "Well, we probably spent that much money on piano lessons so we'll buy you this machine," which I still have. It's a treasure. It's in [crosstalk]</p><p id="t=00:04:28" data-timecode="00:04:28"><a href="#t=00:04:28"><span>00:04:28</span></a><span><strong>Steve:</strong> Wow.</span></p><p id="t=00:04:28" data-timecode="00:04:28"><a href="#t=00:04:28"><span>00:04:28</span></a><span><strong>Jessie:</strong> Wow.

I looked at the back of it and it has the wattage of the machine which was about the wattage of a lightbulb. I remember thinking-</span></p><p id="t=00:04:51" data-timecode="00:04:51"><a href="#t=00:04:51"><span>00:04:51</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Really?</span></p><p id="t=00:04:52" data-timecode="00:04:52"><a href="#t=00:04:52"><span>00:04:52</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> -I knew that my parents didn't have loads of money to burn and they spent a lot of money on this machine and I had this incredible feeling like, "Oh my God, I can't run up their electricity bill with this machine." I used to switch it on and then go and switch a light off somewhere in the house to be like net zero.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:11" data-timecode="00:05:11"><a href="#t=00:05:11"><span>00:05:11</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> I actually don't think my parents had that little money but it was more like I had this thing where I was like I got to--</span></p><p id="t=00:05:18" data-timecode="00:05:18"><a href="#t=00:05:18"><span>00:05:18</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> If it draws 60 watts, this is not even observable on the power bill I assume.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:23" data-timecode="00:05:23"><a href="#t=00:05:23"><span>00:05:23</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> I guess but I felt as a-- I was a child and I decided I've got to do my bit.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:28" data-timecode="00:05:28"><a href="#t=00:05:28"><span>00:05:28</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> What a [unintelligible 00:05:28] child.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:29" data-timecode="00:05:29"><a href="#t=00:05:29"><span>00:05:29</span></a><span><strong>Jessie:</strong> I know, it's really cute.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:30" data-timecode="00:05:30"><a href="#t=00:05:30"><span>00:05:30</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Meanwhile, my child--</span></p><p id="t=00:05:32" data-timecode="00:05:32"><a href="#t=00:05:32"><span>00:05:32</span></a><span><strong>Steve:</strong> I'll take one of those.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:32" data-timecode="00:05:32"><a href="#t=00:05:32"><span>00:05:32</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> I'll take one of those too. I can't get my kids to be like, "Could you just get off the mobile network and onto the wifi so you don't bankrupt the household watching Youtube."</span></p><p id="t=00:05:41" data-timecode="00:05:41"><a href="#t=00:05:41"><span>00:05:41</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> It was a different time.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:42" data-timecode="00:05:42"><a href="#t=00:05:42"><span>00:05:42</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> It was a different time. Children were so mindful of the power bill.</span></p><p id="t=00:05:47" data-timecode="00:05:47"><a href="#t=00:05:47"><span>00:05:47</span></a><span><strong>Jon:</strong> Actually to continue to answer your question if you go really right back in time, at some point when I was about I think seven, I was very bright and my parents were, "What the hell do we do with this bright kid?" They [00:06:00] found-- They [00:06:00] found-- because it's pre-internet. This is in the '70s. They found this association which was for desperate parents of intelligent children.</span></p><p>They're like, "What do we do with him?" They do this thing at Cambridge University in the summer where you could basically take your kids and dump them off and there your kids run wild. I went to that a couple of times and I actually hated it because some of the kids were so snotty, but there was one person I went up to and obviously, this person was in either the mathematics or computer science department at Cambridge, and I said, "Oh, explain to me how a computer works. I want to know." Imagine I'm like seven years old.</p><p>What I remember of that is the person getting out a pad of paper and starting drew this strip on it and build boxes on it and basically describe the Turing machine. I have at home, my own little Turing things I've tried to do in strips of paper and come up with this computer thing. I think I was infected with computer stuff pretty early on. Mother would say even as a baby I was fascinated by things like how does the clock work? I would stare at clocks, "How does that work?" I don't know. Something happens probably in the womb, maybe.</p><p id="t=00:07:15" data-timecode="00:07:15"><a href="#t=00:07:15"><span>00:07:15</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Where is the eight-year-old that explained the Turing machine? Where did he end up?</span></p><p id="t=00:07:21" data-timecode="00:07:21"><a href="#t=00:07:21"><span>00:07:21</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, this was a professor at Cambridge.</span></p><p id="t=00:07:22" data-timecode="00:07:22"><a href="#t=00:07:22"><span>00:07:22</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> Oh, professor. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.</span></p><p id="t=00:07:24" data-timecode="00:07:24"><a href="#t=00:07:24"><span>00:07:24</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> It was an adult. Whether he was like 21 or 40, I have no idea. As a child, if somebody sat and explained this to me, I was like, "Whoa, this is amazing." Then, of course, later on, I go and actually go to do computer science. I was like, "Wait a minute. That's a Turing machine." This guy Turing and now I hear about all this stuff for real and some of the theories. I don't know. I was into computers from an early age. I was nerdy.</span></p><p id="t=00:07:47" data-timecode="00:07:47"><a href="#t=00:07:47"><span>00:07:47</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> You were obviously writing your own programs on the BBC Micro?</span></p><p id="t=00:07:51" data-timecode="00:07:51"><a href="#t=00:07:51"><span>00:07:51</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Yes, obviously. I think I started out just playing with the machine, trying to understand it. Then I bought this book that was called The Advanced User's Guide, it had a lot of stuff about how the operating system or the BIOS for this thing worked and a lot of the gut there. I was very interested in that. I really learned assembly language and then started doing assembly language stuff on the machine. At the same time, I was programming another 8-bit machine which was made by Sharp MZ-80K, and then some others that Z80-based machines.</span></p><p id="t=00:08:23" data-timecode="00:08:23"><a href="#t=00:08:23"><span>00:08:23</span></a><span><strong>Bryan:</strong> The MZ to give you the 80K. Interesting.</span></p><p id="t=00:08:28" data-timecode="00:08:28"><a href="#t=00:08:28"><span>00:08:28</span></a><span><strong>John:</strong> Yes. It's a bit like a Commodore PET as an integrated CRT and a tape player, and unusually it had a keyboard where you could actually type every character that was in the character set. It's really weird because basically, it didn't have ASCII. It had its own thing with all sorts of crazy symbols and stuff and you could type everything. Anyway, I was reading some assembly language programming basically to make my programs faster or to access bits of the operating system and build various things. Me with another boy in high school, we wrote programs. We wrote a statistical analysis package. We wrote I think, the timetabling. Then basically around this time there, we had a 100-kilobit per second I think local area network at school. We disassembled the operating system and figured out how to make it work. I think the funny thing was we disassembled how …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="penci-post-entry-inner"><p>I recently read through a Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25346851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thread</a> discussing the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> “Kafka Is Not A Database”, by <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>. The opinions behind this topic are fascinating and I enjoyed sifting through comments from both sides of the table. For the purposes of this post, I’ve labeled these two broad groups of thoughts as Team Blue and Team Red.</p><p>Team Blue believes that <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kafka</a>, a popular streaming platform, has the potential to be the source-of-truth for your data—replacing one of the key responsibilities of conventional databases.</p><p>Team Red strongly disagrees.</p><p>The following is high-level summary of these opinions.</p> <h2><strong>Kafka As A Database</strong></h2><h3>TL;DR Streams,Events,Kafka</h3><p>First, a conceptual model of streams:</p><blockquote><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, a&nbsp;<strong>stream</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence">sequence</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element">data elements</a>&nbsp;made available over time.&nbsp;A stream can be thought of as items on a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt">conveyor belt</a>&nbsp;being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Imagine that you’ve hired an invisible assistant. This assistant’s only responsibility is to record everything you do:</p><ol><li>Wakes up @ 8 am</li><li>Brushes teeth @ 8:35 am</li><li>Begins showering @ 8:40 am</li><li>…</li></ol><p>As you go about your day, your assistant meticulously captures your activity and adds new entries into your daily log. This growing log represents a <strong>stream </strong>of your day-to-day activity. The data elements that comprise the stream are known as <strong>events</strong>. Once an event is recorded, it is immutable; the fact that you brushed your teeth at 8:35 am yesterday will never change.</p><p>While your invisible assistant is following you around and <strong>producing</strong> new events to your stream, who is <strong>consuming</strong> them? Anyone who cares! I’m sure your mom would be thrilled to process through your activities and call you if there are any anomalies.</p><p>What about <strong>Kafka</strong>?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open-source</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stream-processing</a>&nbsp;software platform developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Software Foundation</a>, written in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scala</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java</a>.&nbsp;</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Kafka is a platform (large set of software tools) that helps programmers work with streams.</p><h2>Team Blue – Streams Everywhere</h2><p>Team Blue believes that streams are a natural model for both life and computing. Your users produce a stream of clicks, sign-ups, and orders. Your code produces a stream of logs, metrics, and programmatic events. Team Blue believes that the intuitive nature of streams can lead to intuitive software architectures.</p><p>An essential component of any system is the database—a convenient place to read and write whatever you want. How can a stream replace this concept that we are so used to? If streams are a never-ending series of immutable events, then the property of state is the culmination of events up to a certain point in time. For example, the latest state of a database is the culmination of all operations made to that database. In computing, this is referred to as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Event Sourcing</a>. This paradigm is very different to how many developers are used to thinking about their data.</p><p>Beyond data storage, Team Blue is bullish on the idea of stream-focused architectures in general. Streams work well with microservices, promote loose coupling of systems, and have the potential to create leverage in your software. If you’re thinking about streams, you will inevitably think about Kafka—one of the industry’s leading streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Can</strong> you use Kafka as a database? Team Blue says yes.</p><p><strong>Should</strong> you use Kafka as a database? That’s up to you.</p><h2>Team Red – You Need Databases</h2><p>On the other side of the table is Team Red who believes that programmers are making a mistake by replacing conventional databases with Kafka.</p><p>Team Red believes that 99% of applications need the features of a conventional database—especially the features handling complex concurrency issues. Many of us use these features and they are critical for the success of our applications. Modern databases are battle-tested and have been iterated on for decades. Team Red believes that the message of “Kafka As A Database” is a dangerous message that leads developers into architectures they’re not equipped to handle.</p><h2>The People On Each Team</h2><p>There is no shortage of influential people who align with Team Blue. One notable engineer is <a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Kreps</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Confluent</a>. Confluent is an organization that sells Kafka as a solution to enterprises. There is a direct correlation between using streams and using Kafka; I’m sure Jay has a few extra reasons to be bullish on streams beyond his personal software architecture preferences.</p><p>Another influencer aligned with Team Blue is <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Kleppmann</a>, author of the extremely popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>. Martin Kleppmann is a researcher who loves the idea of streams. His goal is to educate as many programmers as possible. Martin’s only qualm with Team Red’s opinion is the tone of their blog post. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl/status/1336336852890963977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Nice blog post [Kafka Is Not A Database] explaining why the “database inside out” approach is not for everyone. <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun">@narayanarjun</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew">@frasergeorgew</a> are right —&nbsp;if you need to maintain constraints before events are written (e.g. not selling more items than you have in stock), it’s easier to use a DB and CDC.</p><p>On the other hand, the message is also a bit patronising. It basically says “you’re not clever enough to use an event log correctly — leave database stuff to the experts”. I respectfully disagree: it is good to explore new approaches. Learn about the trade-offs, educate yourself.</p><cite>Martin Kleppmann</cite></blockquote><p>Engineers on Team Red’s side include <a href="https://materialize.com/author/arjun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://materialize.com/author/george-fraser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>, co-authors of the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> which refutes the idea of “Kafka As A Database.” They have decided to put a large, yellow caution sign in front of Team Blue’s message. Team Red has no issue with Kafka or streams; they have an issue with eager developers throwing out their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDMSs</a> and jumping on the stream bandwagon. Their only extra agenda might be to get extra eyeballs on their engineering blogs.</p><h2>Arguments From Team Blue</h2><p>The following points are summaries of topics discussed in Martin Kleppmann’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0&amp;t=2089s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>.</p><h3>High Integrity Data – Never Deleted</h3><p>With a database, your information is easily susceptible to being lost. Once your Postgres row is updated, it’s difficult to recover the previous state of that row without introducing custom accountability software. Databases and the records inside them are designed to be mutable. It’s both a great convenience and a great risk. If a table accidentally gets deleted, you might find yourself scrambling to restore your database from a backup. This is particularly painful in production.</p><p>On the other hand, if your data exists as a log of immutable events—and that log happens to be retained forever—the history of your changes never runs the risk of being erased. Accounting is a great example of this—accountants balance their books by only appending new entries to their ledgers. An error in a financial transaction is always fixed by another transaction.</p><p>Team Blue believes that this characteristic can be an asset to software architectures. As a permanent log of events, data will always have its historical context and can easily be audited. Furthermore, the lack of an “eraser” forces programmers and processes to be held highly accountable for their actions.</p><div> <p><span>Trade-Off</span>: </p><p> One concern of storing all your data in a log is that the size of your logs may become unwieldy over time. Do we really care about how a customer changed their email 3 years ago or do we only care about what it is today? Large Kafka logs can also complicate consumers—catching up from offset 0 may not be so easy. Kafka has implemented features like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Log Compaction </a> to mitigate this. However, this is yet another complexity for programmers to manage and debug. </p><p> Another trade-off of this architecture is that it can become cumbersome for privacy concerns. There are administrative use-cases (GDPR) when you are required to completely <strong>hard delete</strong> all of your customer’s personal information from your system. This takes additional effort if the data to be deleted is scattered across logs and storage systems.</p></div><h3>Separation Of Concerns – Reading / Writing</h3><p>Team Blue points out that one of the great conveniences of databases is also one of its greatest challenges. The convenience of databases is undeniable—an easy one-stop shop to read and write anything. The drawback to being a one-stop shop is that you can’t be the best at any <strong>one</strong> thing, which becomes problematic as you scale.</p><p>Conventional databases easy conflate reads and writes, two very different styles of operations. As you scale, the access patterns in your software will inevitably force you to optimize for a certain set of operations. If an operation-specific optimization is done in a centralized location, it will likely degrade the performance of other operations in that location. If you optimize reads, you complicate writes—and vice versa.</p><p>One of the first steps in optimizing SQL reads is to begin denormalizing (duplicating) data across various tables. Once your data is duplicated, queries require less joins and respond faster. However, the drawback of denormalization is that it creates additional complications on the write pathway. Programmers need to remember to update and synchronize the duplicated data across multiple tables.</p><p>This pattern grows in complexity as you scale. If denormalization isn’t getting you the required read performance, the usual next step is to introduce a cache in front of your database. A cache is extremely convenient and can be designed to precisely answer the questions your clients are asking. However, as many programmers are intimately aware of, maintaining a cache is never easy. You now to need synchronize writes across network boundaries, worry about distributed transactions, and debug subtle invalidation issues.</p><p>Going back to our make-believe example, my assistant only has <strong>one</strong> responsibility—log my daily activity. One day, I decide that I want to look back in time to see how my activities are categorized. Unfortunately, I can’t ask my assistant this question because it’s too specific; all he knows how to do is produce events. To get insights on my activity, …</p></div></div></div>

		<em>How do you design good abstractions? By using abstractions that already exist.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was a boy, I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck">cassette tape player</a>. It came with playback controls like these:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/playback-controls.png" alt="Rewind, play/pause, and fast forward symbols.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Soon after cassette players had become widely adopted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder">VCR</a> manufacturers figured out that they could reuse those symbols to make their machines easier to use. Everyone could play a video tape, but 'no one' could 'program' them, because, while playback controls were already universally understood by consumers, each VCR came with its own proprietary interface for 'programming'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then came <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_player">CD players</a>. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		MP3 players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		Streaming audio and video players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you download an app that plays music, odds are that you'll find it easy to get started playing music. One reason is that all playback apps seem to have the same common set of controls. It's an abstraction that you already know.

		Understanding source code <a href="#b07a5341dd654a529ea45517c4e80aff" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		As I explain in my <a href="https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-1/show">Humane Code</a> video, you can't program without abstractions. To summarise, in <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">the words of Robert C. Martin</a>
		</p><blockquote>
			"Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential"
		</blockquote><p>
		With such abstractions, source code becomes easier to understand. Like everything else, there's no silver bullet, but good coding abstractions can save you much grief, and make it easier to understand big and complex code bases.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only can a good abstraction shield you from having to understand all the details in a big system, but if you're familiar with the abstraction, you may be able to quickly get up to speed.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the above definition is great for identifying a good abstraction, it doesn't tell you how to create one.
	</p>

		Design patterns <a href="#d0a8ec8fa11e4455bbed098d9a61c24c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://amzn.to/XBYukB">Design Patterns</a> explains that a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. As I interpret the original intent of the Gang of Four, the book was an attempt to collect and abstract solutions that were repeatedly observed 'in the wild'. The design patterns in the book are <em>descriptive</em>, not prescriptive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are useful in two ways:
		</p><ul>
			<li>They offer solutions</li>
			<li>They form a vocabulary</li>
		</ul><p>
		In my opinion, however, people often overlook the second advantage. Programmers are often eager to find <em>solutions</em>. "I have a problem; what's the solution? Oh, here's a design pattern that fits!"
	</p>
	<p>
		I have no problems with ready-made solutions, but I think that the other advantage may be even bigger. When you're looking at unfamiliar source code, you struggle to understand how it's structured, and what it does. If, hypothetically, you discover that pieces of that unfamiliar source code follows a design pattern that you know, then understanding the code becomes much easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two criteria for this to happen:
		</p><ul>
			<li>The reader (you) must already know the pattern</li>
			<li>The original author (also you?) must have implemented the pattern without any surprising deviations</li>
		</ul><p>
		As a programmer (code author), you can help readers (users) of your code. Don't use every design pattern in the book, but when you use one, make it as obvious to the reader as you can: Use the terminology, class names, and so on from the book. Add comments where your naming deviates. Add links that the novice user can follow to learn more.
	</p>

		Ambiguous specification <a href="#3f4cb22e7a8642cd9938c89b22c098bf" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Programming to a well-known abstraction is a force multiplier, but it does require that those two conditions are satisfied: prior knowledge, and correct implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know how to solve the <em>prior knowledge</em> requirement, other than to tell you to study. I do, however, think that it's possible to formalise some of the known design patterns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most design patterns are described in some depth. They come with sections on motivation, when to use and not to use, diagrams, and example code. Furthermore, they also come with an overview of <em>variations</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Picture this: as a reader, you've just identified that the code you're looking at is an implementation of a design pattern. Then you realise that it isn't structured like you'd expect, or that its behaviour surprises you. Was the author incompetent, after all?
	</p>
	<p>
		While you're inclined to believe the worst about your fellow (wo)man, you look up the original pattern, and there it is: the author is using a variation of the pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are ambiguous.

	</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Design Patterns</em> was a great effort in 1994, and I've personally benefited from it. The catalogue was an attempt to discover good abstractions.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's a good abstraction? As already quoted, it's a model that amplifies the essentials, etcetera. I think a good abstraction should also be <em>intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's the most intuitive abstractions ever?
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stay with me, please. If you're a normal reader of my blog, you're most likely an 'industry programmer' or <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/12/18/RangersandZookeepers">enterprise developer</a>. You're not interested in mathematics. Perhaps mathematics even turns you off, and at the very least, you never had use for mathematics in programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may not find <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology">differential topology</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus">stochastic calculus</a>, intuitive, but that's not the kind of mathematics I have in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basic arithmetic is intuitive. You know: <em>1 + 3 = 4</em>, or <em>3 * 4 = 12</em>. In fact, it's <em>so intuitive</em> that you can't formally prove it -without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axioms</a>, that is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">These axioms</a> are unprovable; you must take them at face value, but you'll readily do that because they're <em>so intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics is a big structure, but it's all based on intuitive axioms. Mathematics is intuitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writers before me have celebrated the power of mathematical abstraction in programming. For instance, in <a href="http://amzn.to/WBCwx7">Domain-Driven Design</a> Eric Evans discusses how <em>Closure of Operations</em> leads to object models reminiscent of arithmetic. If you can design <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a> in such a way that you can somehow 'add' them together, you have an intuitive and powerful abstraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that there's more than one way to combine numbers. You can add them together, but you can also multiply them. Could there be a common abstraction for that? What about objects that can somehow be combined, even if they aren't 'number-like'? The generalisation of such operations is a branch of mathematics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, and it has turned out to be productive when applied to functional programming. <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> is the most prominent example.
	</p>
	<p>
		By an interesting coincidence, the 'things' in category theory are called <em>objects</em>, and while they aren't objects in the sense that we think of in object-oriented design, there <em>is</em> some equivalence. Category theory concerns itself with how objects map to other objects. A functional programmer would interpret such <em>morphisms</em> as functions, but in a sense, you can also think of them as well-defined behaviour that's associated with data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The objects of category theory are universal abstractions. Some of them, it turns out, coincide with known design patterns. The difference is, however, that category theory concepts are governed by specific laws. In order to be a functor, for example, an object must obey certain simple and intuitive laws. This makes the category theory concepts more specific, and less ambiguous, than design patterns.

		I believe that learning about these universal abstractions is the next step in software design. If you know design patterns, you have a vocabulary, but the details are still open to interpretation. If you know category theory, you have a better vocabulary. Just like design patterns, you have to learn these things, but once you've learned them, you've learned something that transcends a particular software library, a particular framework, a particular programming language. Learning about functors, monoids, and so on, is a good investment, because these concepts are rooted in mathematics, not any particular technology.

<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index split</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hash-index-in-postgresql"><a href="#hash-index-in-postgresql">Hash Index in PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>BEGIN</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>
<span>─────────────────────────┼───────┼──────────┼────────</span>
<span>shorturl_key_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 73 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_key_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 37 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 53 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 36 MB</span>

<p><span>J</span>oão Carlos Martins still performs even while stranded at home during a pandemic. Dressed in a dark shirt and slacks, the 80-year-old Brazilian pianist and conductor sits on the couch at his São Paulo duplex apartment, gesturing while he talks, as if in command of an orchestra. The motioning also showcased an unusual pair of black neoprene half-gloves that Martins, one of the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/arts/classical-music-a-life-stranger-than-art-even-his-eccentric-art.html?searchResultPosition=11">most acclaimed interpreters</a> of Bach, wears at practically every waking hour, and sometimes even to sleep.</p>



<p>Two decades ago, he started replacing the grand piano with the baton, as a series of injuries and chronic diseases slowly compromised the movement of his hands. After a decades-long pursuit for a cure that took him through 24 surgeries and every high-tech medical therapy money could buy, it ended up being those gloves — a simple workaround created by a Brazilian industrial designer with no medical training — that brought his hands back to life.</p>



<p>He quit the piano for good in early 2019, right before he underwent his 24th operation, which made him lose all dexterity in his left hand, ending any possibility of the maestro ever playing again. He observed the occasion with an emotional appearance on <a href="https://globoplay.globo.com/v/7389347/">Brazilian national television</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stepping away from the instrument felt like “carrying a corpse” in the chest, Martins said.<strong><em> </em></strong>But ten months later, he was back at his piano bench, tearfully playing the instrument while wearing the neoprene gloves, with full use of his hands for the first time in two decades.</p>



<div><p>That extraordinary comeback began in July 2019, at a tour stop in Sumaré, upstate São Paulo, when the maestro opened his dressing room door before conducting his orchestra <a href="https://www.sesisp.org.br/cultura/bachiana-filarmonica-sesi-sp">Bachiana Filarmônica</a> to find a local resident carrying a box.</p><p>Industrial designer Ubiratan Bizarro watched Martins’ final piano performance months earlier on TV and took it upon himself to find a way to help. He binge-watched videos of Martins’ piano performances, taking screenshots and zooming in to analyze his hand movements.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>He then developed a prototype: a pair of neoprene half-gloves with a stiff structure and plastic extensions on each finger tip. That first pair, however, turned out to be something “suitable for boxing, at best,” as Martins chuckled in conversation with <em>Rest of World</em>. “But I kept thinking that this guy had shown a real interest, so I invited him over for lunch and explained what had happened to my hands.”&nbsp;</p>

      <figcaption>The gloves took five months and six prototypes to develop.</figcaption>

<p>As a teenager, Martins developed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662617/">focal dystonia</a>, a neurological condition that causes involuntary body movements. As a result, his fingers tend to twitch: not ideal when tickling the ivories. Over the years, he gradually lost control of his hands. His long hours of practice also cost him a severe <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/repetitive-strain-injury">repetitive strain injury</a> (RSI), which led to recurrent pain. “Every time my fingers would hit a key, it felt like getting stabbed.”<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Other injuries also damaged his nervous system. In 1966, Martins fell to the ground during a soccer game in Central Park, New York, and the injury to a nerve in his arm caused him to lose part of the movements in his right hand.</p>



<p>In the mid-1990s, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703376504575492052972871316">muggers in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia</a> gave him a concussion that kept him in the hospital for eight months, while the right side of his body remained partially paralyzed. It would be a full year until he could play again.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Martins fought through these health issues. Since the symptoms of his dystonia were less intense right after he woke up, he used to take naps on dressing room floors before every concert. Benefiting from a “great predisposition to sleep wherever I want,” Martins described how he could fall asleep by 3 p.m. and wake 15 minutes before a show. At one point during each concert, the pain from the RSI got so bad that only what he called an “adrenaline rush” kept him going long enough to finish the performance. Thus, when Bizarro knocked on his door last year, Martins figured he had nothing to lose.</p><p>The pianist described the parts of his hands that still worked, demonstrating how he could still press down his fingers but could not move them back up. He also showed Bizarro how he lost part of his hand muscles and nerves, cut off during multiple surgeries.</p><p>The designer left the maestro’s apartment and dove back into YouTube, where he studied videos about car mechanics and aerodynamics. “I recalled a team at Formula One and the springs in their car suspension, and I thought I could use something similar,” Bizarro told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Using his 3D printer, Bizarro remade the neoprene glove from scratch. It took five months and six prototypes. The final version had flexible steel rods that connected the fingers to the hand’s back; whenever the maestro pressed a key, each rod would bring the finger back to its original place, with a simple spring movement. Instead of attempting to fix the complex neurological condition, the gloves tackled the most elementary mechanics of the maestro’s hands.</p>

<p>When Martins showed his medical team the sixth prototype, it received immediate approval. They were already familiar with the long list of therapies the pianist had undergone — from Botox to a neural stimulating device implanted in Martins’ brain cortex in 2012. “We already knew that gloves could not worsen his condition, whose source is in the cortex,” said Rames Mattar, the orthopedic surgeon who led his last surgery, to <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mattar stressed that the device wasn’t a cure and that his patient was well aware of that. “But who would have thought,” the maestro asked, “that a designer without medical training could create such a thing?”</p>



<p>With the doctors’ stamp of approval and the gloves on his hands, Martins made his first attempt to play the grand piano again in his living room during Christmas 2019. For the first time in 22 years, he hit the keys with all ten fingers, playing a rendition of a Chopin’s nocturne. He shared the first of many videos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6c3-4FHUgs/">on Instagram</a>, and Brazilians flooded his profile with emotional comments. His short homemade piano recitals reached new audiences when they were shared by U.S. celebrities <a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman">Rex Chapman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/violadavis/status/1310787380920619010">Viola Davis</a>.</p>



<p>Bizarro now is selling versions of Martins’ “extensor gloves” online for $250. They come in three different sizes and can be shipped to clients in Europe, India, and the United States.</p>



<p>The maestro is now rarely seen without his gloves. His practice sessions go on for so long — four hours daily — that he relies on a silent piano to work on his hand movements so as to not upset the downstairs neighbors, but when he has to rehearse for a concert, the maestro goes full volume. Martins understands that this might not be his definite comeback, since the dystonia has crept back to his hands before. “If in a couple of years, my condition also beats these gloves, I’ll confront it,” he said. “I’ve already had to change the way I play a hundred times.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    
                    <p>The demand for data engineers is growing rapidly. According to <a href="http://hired.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">hired.com</a> the <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-software-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="3" data-reactroot="">demand has increased by 45%</a> in 2019. The median salary for Data Engineers in SF Bay Area is around $160k. So the question is: how to become a data engineer?<!--StartFragment--></p>
<h2>What Data Engineering is</h2>
<p>Data engineering is closely related to data as you can see from its name. But if data analytics usually means extracting insights from existing data, data engineering means the process of building infrastructure to deliver, store and process the data. According to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007">The AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>, the data engineering proccess is located at the very bottom: Collect, Move &amp; Store, Data Preparation. So if your organization wants to be data/AI-driven then they should hire/train data engineers.</p>
<figure><img src="https://khashtamov.com/uploads/redactor/1_7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png" data-image="1_7IMev5xslc9FLxr9hHhpFw.png"></figure>

<p>But what data engineers actually do? The amount of data is growing rapidly every single day. We are contemplating the new era where everybody can do a content from their mobile phone and other gadgets. Even small devices are connected to the Internet. Data engineers from the past were responsible for writing complex SQL queries, building ETL (extract, transform &amp; load) processes using big enterprise tools like Informatica ETL, Pentaho ETL, Talend etc. But now the market demands more broader skillset. If you want to work as a data engineer you need to have:</p>
<ul><li>Intermediate knowledge of SQL and Python</li><li>Experience working with cloud providers like AWS, Azure or GCP</li><li>The knowledge of Java/Scala is a big plus</li><li>Understading SQL/NoSQL databases (data modeling, data warehousing, performance optimization)</li></ul>
<p>The skillset is very similar to what Backend engineers usually know. In reality if an organization is growing in terms of data the ideal candidate to transform into data engineer is a backend engineer.</p>

<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3273608550190378" data-ad-slot="9434009847"></ins>


<p>The particular technologies and tools could differ due to company size, data volumes and data velocity. If we look at the FAANG for example, they usually require:</p>
<ul><li>Knowledge of Python, Java or Scala</li><li>Experience working with Big data tools like Apache Hadoop, Kafka and Spark</li><li>Solid knowledge of algorithms and data structures</li><li>Undestanding of distributed systems</li><li>Experience with Business Intelligence tools like Tableau, QlikView, Looker or Superset</li></ul>
<h2>Data Engineer's Skillset</h2>
<p>Data engineering is an engineering area that is why the knowledge of computer science fundamentals is required, especially the understanding of most popular algorithms and data structures (Hello Mr. Cormen!).</p>
<p>Because data engineers deal with the data on a daily basis understading how databases work is a huge plus. For example, the most popular SQL databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL use B-Tree data structure under the hood.</p>
<h3>Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
<p>If you prefer video courses I would recommend to look at the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms">Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization</a>. I took these courses and think they are quite good as a starting point.</p>
<p>Speaking about talks I would highly recommend take a look at Alex Petrov's presentation called <em>What Every Programmer has to know about Database Storage:</em></p>
<figure><iframe width="100%" height="497" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1wbQPbFZdk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></iframe></figure>
<p>Alex has a great series of posts related to databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-part-1-flavours-of-io-8e1ace1de017">On Disk IO, Part 1: Flavors of IO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-part-2-more-flavours-of-io-c945db3edb13">On Disk IO, Part 2: More Flavours of IO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-part-3-lsm-trees-8b2da218496f">On Disk IO, Part 3: LSM Trees</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-storage-part-4-b-trees-30791060741">On Disk IO, Part 4: B-Trees and RUM Conjecture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/databasss/on-disk-io-access-patterns-in-lsm-trees-2ba8dffc05f9">On Disk IO, Part 5: Access Patterns in LSM Trees</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Courses, video presentations are good but what about books? I would recommend the only book by Thomas Cormen and friends called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0262033844&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=74742875db503b1a899ca35159749067">Introduction to Algorithms</a>. The most comprehensive reference on algorithms and data structures. To practice and strengthen your knowlegde go to <a href="http://leetcode.com/">leetcode.com</a> and start solving problems. Practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>Databases are great, Carnegie Mellon University uploads their lessons to Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeYBdghaIjc&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi">Introduction to Database Systems (Fall 2019)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdW5RKUboKc&amp;list=PLSE8ODhjZXjasmrEd2_Yi1deeE360zv5O">Advanced Database Systems (Spring 2020)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>SQL — the lingua franca for databases</h3>
<p>SQL was developed back in 70s and still is the most popular language to work with data. Periodically some experts claim that SQL is going to die very soon, but it is still alive despite many rumors. I think we will stick to SQL for another decade or two (or even more). If you look at the modern and popular databases you will see that almost all of them support SQL:</p>
<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle DB</li>
<li>Amazon Redshift, Apache Druid, Yandex ClickHouse</li>
<li>HP Vertica, Greenplum</li>
</ul>
<p>In a big data ecosystem there are many different SQL engines: Presto (Trino), Hive, Impala etc. I would highly recommend to invest some time to master SQL.</p>
<p>If you are new to SQL, start with the Mode's SQL guide: <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/">Introduction to SQL</a>. If you feel comfortable you can continue with the <a href="https://bit.ly/2XrRH4i" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">DataCamp's interactive courses</a>. I would recommend these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-sql?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">Intermediate SQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-postgresql?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">Joining Data in SQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://datacamp.com/courses/postgresql-summary-stats-and-window-functions?tap_a=5644-dce66f&amp;tap_s=1331588-6fc352&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adylzhankhashtamov" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noindex">PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best resources on SQL are <a href="https://modern-sql.com/">Modern SQL</a> and <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/">Use The Index, Luke!</a> Practice makes perfect that is why go to <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/">Leetcode Databases problemset</a> and start practicing 💪 By the way, do not forget to read my article on <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/sql-window-functions/">SQL window functions</a> as well.</p>
<h3>Programming: Python, Java and Scala</h3>
<p>Python is a very popular programming language to build web apps as well as for data analytics &amp; science. It has a very rich ecosystem and huge community. According to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index</a> Python is in the Top 3 widely used programming languages after C &amp; Java.</p>
<p>Speaking about other 2 languages, many big data systems are written in Java or Scala:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Kafka (Scala)</li>
<li>Hadoop HDFS (Java)</li>
<li>Apache Spark (Scala)</li>
<li>Apache Cassandra (Java)</li>
<li>HBase (Java)</li>
<li>Apache Hive, Presto in Java</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to undestand how these systems work I would recommend to know the language in which they are written. The biggest concern with Python is its poor performance hence the knowledge of a more efficient language will be a big plus to your skillset.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Scala, I would recommend to take a look at <a href="https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/">Twitter's Scala School</a>. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981531687/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0981531687&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=69314619f1e546e3921eb97c72cf4850">Programming in Scala</a> by its creator is also a good starting point.</p>
<h3>The Big Data Tools</h3>
<p>There are lots of different technologies in a Big Data landscape. The most popular are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apache Kafka</strong> is the leading message queue/event bus/event streaming</li>
<li><strong>Apache Spark</strong> is the unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing</li>
<li><strong>Apache Hadoop</strong>, the big data framework which consists of different tools, libraries and frameworks including distributed file system (HDFS), Apache Hive, HBase etc.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Druid</strong> is a real-time analytics database</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really difficult to learn everything that is why focus on the most popular and learn fundamental concepts behind them. For example, back in 2013 Jay Kreps (co-founder of Apache Kafka) wrote the paper called <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction</a>.</p>
<h3>Cloud Platforms</h3>
<p>Everything goes to the clouds. You should have experience working with at least one cloud provider. I would recommend go with the <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> which is the leading cloud provider in the world. The second place goes to the <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, the third place takes <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>.</p>
<p>All providers have certifications. For example, the most suitable certification for a data engineer in AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ru/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/">AWS Certified Data Analytics – Specialty</a>. If you decide to proceed with GCP the right choice is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer">Professional Data Engineer</a>, for MSA is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-engineer">Azure Data Engineer Associate</a>.</p>
<h3>Fundamentals of Distributed Systems</h3>
<p>The amount of data generated nowadays is tremendous. You cannot fit it into one computer. The data should be distributed across different nodes. If you want to be a good data engineer you have to understand the fundamentals of distributed systems. There are lots of resources where you can start your journey into this field:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB">Distributed Systems</a> lectures from MIT by Robert Morris</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB">Distributed Systems</a> lectures by Martin Kleppmann</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNPUF5QyWU8O0Wd8QDh9KaM1ggsxspJ31">Distributed Systems</a> by Lindsey Kuper</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449373321/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1449373321&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=adilkhash-20&amp;linkId=e7e0e096aa5761066245eb90965ac849">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> by Martin Kleppmann. He has a <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/">blog</a>. Also if you prefer blogs I would recommend take a look at the <a href="https://medium.com/baseds">series of posts</a> about distributed systems by Vaidehi Joshi.</p>
<h3>Data Pipelines</h3>
<p>Building a data pipeline is one of the main responsibilities of a data engineer. Data pipeline is a process of data consolidation. Data engineer should be able to reliably deliver, load and transform data from multiple sources into a specific destination, usually it is central data warehouse or data lake. There are many tools which can help you build this process. Take a look at the <a href="https://khashtamov.com/en/introduction-to-apache-airflow/">Apache Airflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi">Luigi</a> from Spotify, <a href="https://www.prefect.io/">Prefect</a> or <a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a>. If you prefer nocode solution <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/">Apache NiFi</a> is a way to go.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Data engineer is a team player who is working with data analysts, scientists, infrastructure engineers and other stakeholders. So do not forget about soft skills like empathy, understanding a business domain, open-mindedness etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Back in December 2019, a few months after I started hacking on Google VRP, I was looking at YouTube. I wanted to find a way to get access to a <code>Private</code> video which I did not own.</p>

<p>When you upload a video to YouTube, you can select between 3 privacy settings. <code>Public</code>, which means that anyone can find and watch your video, <code>Unlisted</code>, which only allows users who know the video ID (the URL) to watch the video, and <code>Private</code>, where only you can watch the video, or other accounts you’ve explicitly given permission to do so.</p>

<p>First thing I did was to upload a video to my second testing account’s YouTube channel, and set the video’s privacy to <code>Private</code>, so I can use that video for testing. <em>(Remember, always only test against resources/accounts you own!)</em> If I can find a way to access that video with my first testing account, we have a bug.</p>

<p>With my first account, I started using YouTube, trying every feature, pressing every button I could find, and whenever I saw an HTTP request with a video ID in it, I changed it to the target <code>Private</code> video, hoping that I can leak some information about it, but I wasn’t really getting any success. The main YouTube site (at least the endpoints I have tested), seems to always check if the video was <code>Private</code> or not, and when trying to request info about the target <code>Private</code> video, they always returned errors such as <code>This video is private!</code>.</p>

<p>I needed to find another way.</p>

<p>A great thing to do in a situation like this, is to try to look for other products/services which are not your main target, but are somehow interacting with its resources internally. If they have access to its resources, it might be possible that they don’t have every level of protection that the main product has.</p>

<p>An interesting target which matched these requirements was Google Ads. This is the product which advertisers use to create ads across all Google services, <em>including YouTube</em>. So, the ads you get before YouTube videos are set up by advertisers here, on the Google Ads platform.</p>

<p>So I created a Google Ads account, and created a new advertisement, which would play a video of mine as a skippable ad for YouTube users. During the ad creation process, I also tried to use the target <code>Private</code> video’s ID wherever I could, but no success.</p>

<p>After creating the ad, I started looking at all of the different Google Ads features. The thing was huge, it had a bunch of different settings/tools. I was trying to find anything that could be YouTube-related.</p>

<p>There was a page called <code>Videos</code>, where I could see a list of videos used by my advertisements. Clicking on a video opened up an <code>Analytics</code> section for that specific video. It had an embedded player, some statistics, and an interesting feature called <code>Moments</code>. It allowed advertisers to “mark” specific moments of the video, to see when different things happen (such as the timestamp of when the company logo appears). To be honest I am not quite sure what advertisers use this feature for, nevertheless, it seemed interesting:</p>

<p><img src="https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/assets/posts/2021-01-11-stealing-your-private-videos-one-frame-at-a-time/ads-moments.gif" alt="The Moments feature on the Ads console"></p>

<p>Looking at the proxy logs, every time I “marked a moment”, a <code>POST</code> request was made to a <code>/GetThumbnails</code> endpoint, with a body which included a video ID:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/aw_video/_/rpc/VideoMomentService/GetThumbnails</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>ads.google.com</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>Internet-Explorer-6</span>
<span>Cookie</span><span>:</span> <span>[redacted]</span>

__ar={"1":"kCTeqs1F4ME","2":"12240","3":"387719230"}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where in the <code>__ar</code> parameter, <code>1</code> was the ID of the video and <code>2</code> was the time of the moment in milliseconds. The response was a base64 encoded image, which was the thumbnail displayed by Ads.</p>

<p>I did what I did a bunch of times already, and replaced the ID to my second account’s <code>Private</code> video in the request, and to my surprise, <strong>it returned a base64 response</strong>!</p>

<p>I quickly Googled “base64 to image”, and pasted the base64 into the first decoder I found, and it <strong>displayed a thumbnail from the target <code>Private</code> video</strong>! It worked! I have found a working IDOR <em>(Insecure Direct Object Reference)</em> bug, where I could get a frame from any private video on YouTube!</p>

<p>But I was like “hm, that is just one frame”. We can do better.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a proof of concept Python script which generates an actual, moving “video”. I searched for some calculations, and figured out that if the video is in 24 FPS, one frame stays on the screen for <code>33</code> milliseconds. So I just have to download every image starting from <code>0</code> milliseconds, incrementing by <code>33</code> milliseconds every time, and then construct some kind of video using all of the images I have acquired.</p>

<p>I wrote a quick and dirty POC which downloaded the frames for the first 3 seconds of a video, decoded them, and then generated a GIF. To test it, I have ran it against an old video of mine, which I had previously privated due to, of course, the <em>high level of cringe</em>:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="315px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3bNbYRTxZM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And there you have it, using this bug, any private YouTube video could have been downloaded by a malicious attacker, which to me feels like a pretty cool impact. But of course, it had a few limitations I couldn’t overcome:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the real world you would have to know the ID of the target video. Mass-leaking those would be considered a bug on its own.</li>
  <li>Since these are just images, you can’t access audio.</li>
  <li>The resolution is very low. (but it’s high enough to see what is happening)</li>
</ul>

<p>The takeaway from this bug is that situations where two different products interact with each other under the hood are always a good area to focus on, since both product teams probably only know their own systems best, and might miss important details when working with a different product’s resources.</p>

<p>Looking for an IDOR like this can be a very repetitive and manual task, and nowadays I try to avoid just blindly changing IDs everywhere and hoping for the best. After you test a product for a while and get a feel of how it works internally, it might be more effective (and more fun) to try to think about different unexpected actions that the developers maybe didn’t think about based on what you saw already, or focus on features that just got released, or to just do any other non-mindless task. You will probably enjoy it more in the long term. In my opinion, the more you understand a system, the more ideas about how to break it will just naturally come to mind.</p>

<p>But again, even in the most robust and well tested systems, there is the chance that just swapping an ID in a request will get you a critical bug.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! See you <a href="https://twitter.com/xdavidhu" target="_blank">next Monday</a> ;)</p>

January 11, 2021 | https://www.murilopereira.com/whats-good-about-staying-inside-emacs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.murilopereira.com/whats-good-about-staying-inside-emacs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 2: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 2: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p></div></div>]]>

January 11, 2021 | https://tuangeek.com/blog/i-own-your-domain-now-i-own-your-bitcoin-too/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tuangeek.com/blog/i-own-your-domain-now-i-own-your-bitcoin-too/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Over the weekend I was receiving some unusual emails from some cryptocurrency payment processors. Ones that I’ve never heard of let alone used. At first, I thought they were spam or phishing emails so I just ignored them. However, when BTC prices started rising the occurrence of emails also started to be more frequent.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/recovery_email_screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>More frequent emails about BTC payment processors.</em></p>
<p>As emails piled up I started to get more suspicious that this wasn’t a scam and someone was actually trying to recover their password. Inspecting the email headers I realized that I was receiving catch-all emails from a parked domain that I recently bought. Apparently the previous owner used the domain as his primary email when he signed up for those accounts. So right now the previous owner has forgotten their password and is attempting to recover their account. But there is one problem. They no longer own the domain, I do. There was no way for me to contact the previous owner and offer my help.</p>
<p>The next obvious course of action for me to was to see if I can actually change the password and essentially gain control to these accounts. If the previous owner actually knew the password, he/she would have changed the default email address by now. So it’s a fair assumption that any account still linked to my domain is long forgotten. So one by one I went and requested a password reset for the most popular cryptocurrency websites.</p>
<h2 id="service-1">Service #1</h2>
<p>I started with CoinPayments because it was the lowest hanging fruit due to the fact that I was still receiving emails from them. I expected this to fail because I had no knowledge about the previous owner, not even his/her name. To my surprise it was too easy. I was able to request a password reset and got an email to update my password in less than a minute. But as soon as I tried to log in I was face with a 2fa challenge.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/2fa_coinpayments.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>2 Factor Authentication Challenge for CoinPayments</em></p>
<p>This was not a challenge because after all, I do own the email. After waiting for the 2fa code to arrive I was able to login and had full control of the account. I quickly tried to see how much BTC it had and was disappointed to see that it had none.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/coinpayments_zero_balance.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>CoinPayments BTC wallet with zero BTC.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/coinpayments_recent_transaction.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>CoinPayments Recent Transaction</em></p>
<p>The transaction history showed that the last withdraw was in 2016 September 26. So this account has been inactive for a long time. I doubt the previous owner still remember anything about it.</p>
<h2 id="service-2">Service #2</h2>
<p>I moved on to the next website which was Coinsplit. Again the process was simple and I was able to gain control of the account within seconds of trying. This time there was no 2fa challenge and the balance was even more disappointing, it was actually negative.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/coinsplit_balance_negative.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Coinsplit Negative Balance</em></p>
<h2 id="service-3">Service #3</h2>
<p>For my third trick, I decided to try Confirmo. And you’ve guessed it. Recovering and gaining control of this account wasn’t hard at all. The only difference this time was that this account actually has some leftover BTC that hadn’t been withdrawn yet. At the time of writing BTC was worth $38k and Confirmo account had about $1k worth of BTC.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/confirmo_screenshot_balance.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Confirmo Account with $1k worth of BTC at the time of writing.</em></p>
<p>Bingo! Now things got interesting. Now I’m faced with two choices. <strong>One I can leave the account alone and let the BTC get deleted and forgotten or I can try and withdraw the funds.</strong> I didn’t like option one because it would be a waste, and I really wanted to see how hard it would be to withdraw these funds. So I decided to create an empty wallet and try and withdraw the funds.</p>
<p>My first challenge was trying to add a withdraw address. Which required a physical address and a BTC address. I made up the physical address and used one of the BTC from the wallet I just generated.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/confirmo_settlement_method_edit.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Updating Confirmo settlement method</em></p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/confirmo_2fa_saving_settlement_changes.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>2fa Challenge for updating Confirmo settlement changes</em></p>
<p>There were some security measures of course. Before I can save the changes it required me to pass a 2fa. Again, because I own the email I had no issues getting pass this little challenge. And just like that I was able to add my own BTC address to the settlement account. Now I just have to sit back and wait for the funds to arrive.</p>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/changed_the_payout_address.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Added my own BTC address to the settlement account</em></p>
<h2 id="other-services">Other Services</h2>
<p>I also looked at a couple more accounts. I was able to recover and login to all of them without any issues but they didn’t have any left over BTC. I don’t think 2fa was serious enough back in 2016 for this person to secure his/her account. So I do not blame them for not having their account properly secured with a 2fa outside of their primary email. None of the services are to blame either. They all had the user’s interest in mind and most of them actually tried to stop me by requiring me to verify my email. The only downside is if a malicious person has access to the email they pretty much have everything they need to wreak havoc. There really isn’t a good mechanism from protecting the user’s account.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-protect-your-account">How To Protect Your Account?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for accounts using a email address that you <strong>can control forever</strong>. Maybe a free service like Gmail isn’t bad after all.</li>
<li>Always user 2fa outside of your email. If they control one they are still missing the second piece to do any harm.</li>
<li>Use a password manager. It would be hard for me to guess every service that the previous owner used. This only pop up on my radar because he/she tried to recover the account password.</li>
<li>Email is very powerful. Make sure you protect it properly. I often hear people say their phone is their life. I opt to say say my email is my life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="will-i-keep-the-btc">Will I keep the BTC?</h2>
<p>My plan is to try to give back the BTC to the original owner, but my only problem is I have no way of finding out who they are. That is why I need your help. I will encrypt the Electrum wallet with a password in the format of <username><email address=""> so if the rightful owner knows the username and email address he will be able to unlock the wallet. I can only afford to spend ~$1k time and effort into trying to find the original owner before it becomes diminishing returns.</email></username></p>
<p>Someone suggested that I contact the services to get information on the previous owner. I doubt that this will work because when I logged on to the accounts I saw no names or address of the previous owner. I also doubt that the company will be willing to disclose such information to a random person on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<p><img src="https://tuangeek.com/images/own-email-own-btc/asking_previous_domain_owner.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I contacted the previous domain owner, and he said he did not own any cryptocurrency assets. I’ve got one more person to ask before releasing the wallet for people to try to guess.</p>
<p>2021-12-01 After some research I’ve decided to not release the encrypted wallet. With a password format of <username>_<email> can be easily cracked. So instead I will hold on to the wallet until someone emails me at the <email> address and wants to claim it.</email></email></username></p>

<p>Tether has become a plain old fiat central bank, issuing new USDTs against debt. USDTs are backed, but not by US dollars. They are backed by promises to make good on their debts by the receivers of newly minted USDTs.</p>



<p>While it’s not fraudulent per se, the fact that USDTs aren’t backed by US dollars opens the door to unlimited USDT printing. The gatekeepers are the people in charge of the Tether printing press. In an ideal world, they should ensure that proper reserve requirements are met and that the receivers of newly minted USDTs are properly capitalised.</p>



<p>However, Bitcoin’s exponential price rise, happening in lockstep with ever-increasing USDT issuance, shows that the Tether press has gone in overdrive. When the mania will end, crypto investors will lose everything, in a second.</p>



<h2>The Tetheral Reserve</h2>



<p>Long gone are the days when Tether claimed that USDTs were backed by cash. Its own website states:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26.png 659w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.18.26-300x41.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px"><figcaption>source: tether.to/legal</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not necessarily a bad thing for the crypto ecosystem that Tether doesn’t have cash on hand to the amount of USDTs issued. First off, that would be a central point of failure. Tether the institution is currently under investigation, USDTs are used for money laundering, and having $20 billion in a bank account would expose you to having your assets frozen – as has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-files-for-subpoena-in-bid-to-recover-880-million-in-frozen-funds">already happened in the past</a>.</p>



<p>It’s much more practical to have all your assets in loans to counterparties, from a solvency and operational point of view. The problem is, of course, that is exposes you to:</p>



<h3>Liquidity risk</h3>



<p>The role of USDTs is to replace US dollars in the crypto ecosystem. USDTs are much easier to transfer, because you don’t have to deal with a bank that will ask you all sorts of questions about the origins of the funds, the purpose of the transfer, and the identity of the receiver. In short, you don’t have to bother with AML (“anti money laundering”), KYC (“know your client”), and capital controls regulations. In shorter, USDTs empower you to launder money.</p>



<p>But as much as USDTs are more practical than US dollars, their usage requires convertibility. We live in the real world where nobody accepts USDTs as payment, and you need to be able to cash out your USDTs for real money. You can do this by buying Bitcoin with USDTs on an exchange that trades the BTC/USDT pair, wiring them to an exchange that trades the BTC/USD pair, and cash out. Or, if you are a big player, you can go to a crypto OTC desk and sell your USDTs directly for cash:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-1024x277.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-1024x277.png 1024w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-300x81.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42-768x208.png 768w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.33.42.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>source: https://www.coindesk.com/tether-usdt-russia-china-importers</figcaption></figure>



<p>This act of financial hot potato, where someone else buys your USDTs, works for as long as the crypto bull run goes on. However, you need a backstop for when things go south, namely, when people suddenly stop wanting to acquire USDTs, and want to cash out for real money. Then, someone has to redeem the USDTs for cash, and that someone should be the issuer: Tether.</p>



<p>If Tether doesn’t have enough cash on hand to process redemption requests, you have a good old liquidity crunch, when panic sets in, and people start dumping their USDT holdings en masse, for whatever price of thing they can get in exchange. Much like a real world financial crisis.</p>



<h3>USDT redemptions?</h3>



<p>Tether’s willingness to redeem USDTs for real money has been questioned over the last few years, not least because it seems that they’ve ever barely done it, as the number of USDTs outstanding never goes down:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33.png 946w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33-300x104.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-10.41.33-768x266.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px"><figcaption>USDT market cap, source: coin360</figcaption></figure>



<p>Note that the dip in October 2018 was due to Tether loaning $850m to Bitfinex, not actual redemptions.</p>



<p>Other reasons to question Tether’s willingness to redeem USDTs are the fact that, well, a lot of people couldn’t get Tether to redeem them, despite Tether’s own assurances that proper mechanisms were in place. Moreover, Tether’s own handling of this “FUD” has been anecdotal and shady:</p>



<blockquote>— Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1346101912677048320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>In the tweet above, the CTO of Tether shares “proof” that USDTs can be redeemed. However, the “proof” is just a list of USDT transactions to and from Bitfinex supposedly performed by an OTC desk, and without a matching set of USD transactions, it means nothing. The original question was, after all:</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If anyone…anywhere….has redeemed USDT for USD and can show proof of this transaction I would be happy to compensate you for your time and effort. Thanks! <a href="https://t.co/wScl7s1ZAc">https://t.co/wScl7s1ZAc</a></p>— Santiago Capital (@SantiagoAuFund) <a href="https://twitter.com/SantiagoAuFund/status/1345970353747578882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>Notice the “redeem <strong>for USD</strong>” part that gets ignored by Tether. Yup.</p>



<h2>The mother of all speculative manias</h2>



<p>Remember the real estate bubble of 2003-2007? How people who could barely pay their bills would buy five condos, see their price go up as other people would also buy five condos, and everyone would seemingly get rich out of thin air, together? The reasons for that bubble, in short, were lax lending requirements. A more complete explanation was that banks found ways (thanks to securitisation, reverse engineering credit rating agency rulebooks, and shadow banking) to issue mortgages to people who should have never, ever, qualified for those mortgages. As more mortgages were issued, housing prices went up, in a seemingly infinite loop.</p>



<h3>Infinite money</h3>



<p>Fiat money is issued against debt. I come into a bank, ask for $10,000, and the bank gives me the money in exchange of me acknowledging that I owe the bank $10,000 – plus interest.</p>



<p>Why can’t I come into a bank and ask for $10,000,000,000? Because banks have rules governing how much they can lend and to whom. The first rule is common sense: if customers aren’t able to repay their loans, the bank will go bust, and because the bank doesn’t want to go bust, it will only lend to people whom it deems creditworthy.</p>



<p>Other rules are regulatory. Banks must have adequate capital to absorb losses on their loan portfolio. It means that their assets must exceed their loans, and the riskier the loans, the larger that excess must be. Banks must also perform maturity matching – meaning that their sources of funding can’t be all short term, when they’re underwriting 30 year mortgages. Then there is risk weighting of assets, Basel II capital frameworks, etc., etc. Just look at this monstruosity:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2.jpg 577w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IRB_Basel2-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px"><figcaption>Banking is complicated<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are many, many, many rules in place that are intended to prevent bubbles and manias. Despite the meme that “banks print fiat out of thin air”, they don’t – because of those rules. If they did, you’d have a new tulip bulb mania on every Thursday, and civilisation would collapse before summer.</p>



<h3>Infinite almost-money</h3>



<p>What rules are in place at Tether? What prevents them from printing USDTs out of thin air, without any rules? What prevents Binance from calling Tether and asking for 10,000,000,000 USDTs?</p>



<p>At first glance, the answer is: reality. Were Tether to issue too many USDTs, and start buying BTC and ETH and XRP with it, the price of USDT would get below $1. This has happened in the past, albeit for short periods of time.</p>



<p>But the USDT peg has remained exceptionally stable throughout 2020, despite the greatest financial and economic crisis in recent memory. Exchanges are maintaining the USDT peg, because their very existence depends on it. And USDT has replaced USD  in the crypto ecosystem, they cannot allow it to fail. They have USDT on their books. More importantly, their clients own USDT, and account for it as if it were real US dollars. Should USDT’s price fall, people would sell other cryptocurrencies as well, because they’d need to make up for the lost USDT liquidity – and the whole crypto ecosystem would collapse.</p>



<p>Remember, there is a very real need for USDTs, as long as they are pegged to the US dollar, and can be used for immediate, KYC and AML – free transactions.</p>



<p>The USDT/USD peg is founded on the premise that people won’t try to cash out en masse. As long as they don’t, USDT printing can continue.</p>



<h3>Creating value out of thin air</h3>



<p>Bitcoin doesn’t have intrinsic value. Seriously, it doesn’t. It has no use case (transactions don’t create sustainable demand – you buy Bitcoin, transact, and the other party sells it, a few minutes later), produces no cash flows, gives you no rights or claims. It’s always been a confidence game.</p>



<p>How do you create confidence?</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the higher demand is self-sustaining without manipulation then the manipulation actually bootstrapped genuine value. Maybe like an entrepreneur who aggressively exaggerates the state of development of a project and raises funds but then creates the product and justifies value</p>— Ari Paul ⛓️ (@AriDavidPaul) <a href="https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/965744440303374342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2018</a></blockquote> 



<p>As long as things go up, and people don’t see any reason why they should stop, things will continue going up. Of course, people at large are unreliable, and they could stop thinking that things will continue going up, because there’s a huge economic crisis, for example. Then things go down very fast:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12.png 597w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-07-at-11.33.12-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px"><figcaption>Bitcoin’s price crash during the COVID-19 rout in March 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had this selling been allowed to continue, there wouldn’t be a crypto ecosystem left to speak of, today. This is why Tether and the exchanges came together and crossed the Rubicon, and decided to create USDT liquidity to stop the selling, by minting a huge 1.6 BILLION USDTs on March 31, 2020, and distributing it across main exchanges.</p>



<p>And it worked. The Tetheral Reserve was born – an infinite pool of USDT liquidity, backed by the exchanges themselves, who committed to hold the USDT/USD peg, in order to save the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<h3>To infinity, and beyond</h3>



<p>Since that fateful day nine months ago, the Tether press has been picking up speed. As the price of Bitcoin increases, the confidence in the crypto ecosystem rises to new highs, and people don’t bother to question the exponential rise of USDTs outstanding. First of, because the mainstream media doesn’t talk about it – only about the rise of Bitcoin’s price. Then, because insiders themselves …</p></div></article></div>

<p id="Summary"><span><strong>Summary:</strong></span>
You can’t read a math book the way you read other books.
It takes a special approach to read math, not just pass your eyes over it.
You may need as long as half an hour to get through one page, but
you will understand it when you’re done.</p>

<p id="SeeAlso1"><span><strong>See&nbsp;also:</strong></span>
<a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/succeed.htm">How to Succeed in Math</a>

<h2 id="TwoKinds">Two Kinds of Reading</h2>

<p>In
a Usenet article,
Chan-Ho Suh neatly summed up
the “two kinds of understanding a math text. The first is in being
able to follow, reconstruct, etc. a proof [or solution method].  The
second lies in rewiring one’s brain so that it’s obvious why the
theorem is true” or why the solution works. “Contrary to impressions
you may have garnered from your math courses, the first kind of
understanding is not the primary goal, ... but the second kind
definitely is.”</p>

<h2 id="No">What Not to Do</h2>

<p><strong>Don’t memorize too much.</strong> Many students try to commit
everything to memory. Math doesn’t work like that: you are learning
methods of problem solving. If you treat the material like a mass of
unrelated facts, it will be a big jumble in your head and you’ll very
naturally feel frustrated.</p>

<p>True, there are a few formulas you’ll need to have available. Write
them down on <em>one</em> “cheat sheet”. Look at them in odd moments and
practice saying them over to yourself. Then write 
<span id="U20140922a">them</span> down 
<a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/test.htm#BrainDump">at the start of any test</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Don’t start with the homework problems.</strong> The assigned
problems are not “the homework”. They’re the last part of the
homework. The first part is reading and understanding today’s section
of the textbook.</p>
<p>Most students can’t just listen to the lecture and then
immediately solve the homework problems. The textbook is there to
reinforce your understanding of what was covered in class and to
explain points the lecture didn’t have time to cover.</p>


<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to go back.</strong> Math is relentlessly
cumulative. If you don’t understand something in today’s lesson,
perhaps it’s because you didn’t really understand something in an
earlier lesson, or you’ve forgotten it. Go back and re-learn that
earlier material.</p>
<p>Granted, it can be discouraging to go back to an earlier section
of the book. But you are not moving backward. You’re still making
progress because you’re strengthening your understanding of that
earlier concept.</p>



<h2 id="Yes">What to Do</h2>

<p><strong>First skim for an overview.</strong> Nobody understands
something complex on first reading: about all you can hope to do is
get a general sense of what it’s about and perhaps one or two of the
main points of the argument. That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong
with you; it’s how almost everyone’s mind works. That first reading
just lays the framework for you to fill in later with details.</p>


<p><strong>Then reread with concentration.</strong> Read slower this time.
Highlight important points for further study. (Don’t overdo
the highlighting. Distinguish key points and highlight them; that
should be well under 50% of the text. Color-code if that helps you.)</p>
<p>Some students find it helpful to take notes on separate paper while
reading. If you’ve never done this, you might want to give it a try.
You may find that it helps focus your mind and fit the concepts
together better.</p>


<p><strong>Go through each step of each example.</strong> Don’t read; write.
Many examples have some steps left out; you should write down a
complete solution with all steps. Make sure you understand how the
book gets from each step to the next step.</p>
<p>This is where many students shortchange themselves. There’s a huge
tendency to hit an example and have the eyes just jump to the next bit
of English. But remember that <a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/whyhard.htm">you learn math by
doing</a>, not by reading. You need to work each example to understand
the concept.</p>


<p><strong>Fill in any gaps.</strong> If there are still any words or
concepts you don’t understand, go back to the book and learn them. If
you need to, put them on the list to talk over with your study buddy
or with a <a href="http://www.tc3.edu/bcl/">Baker Center</a> tutor,
or see your instructor outside of class if s/he’s available.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, get those problems cleared up before the next
class so that they don’t interfere with your understanding that
lecture.</p>

<p><strong>Think about what you’ve read.</strong> Fit it in with what
you already know. Is this a more general version of a specific case you
learned earlier? Is this a shorter method for something you previously
learned to do a longer way? Does this use something you learned
previously that looked useless at the time?</p>

<p><strong>Make it your own.</strong> Can you explain this to someone
else? (This is where a <a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/study.htm#Group">study group</a>
really shines.) If there’s no one else available, can you explain it
aloud, without stumbling? If you can do that, you probably understand
it. Don’t shortchange yourself here! “I sort of get it” means you
need to go over it again (but maybe after a break).</p>

<p id="Chunks"><strong>Divide and conquer.</strong> If you have a whole chapter
to learn, master one section at a time. Try to spread your work evenly
over the available time.</p>

<p><strong>Do the homework problems.</strong> If you don’t understand how to
do one, look back in the book for a similar problem. Don’t just push
numbers at it; make sure you understand the example and see how to
apply it.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://brownmath.com/stfa/prob.htm">separate page</a> gives some suggestions for
working story problems.</p>

We all know that we have a much better chance of getting what we want in life if we purposefully set goals. </p><p>The content available on the subject is downright prolific. There is so much information out there, in fact, that it can be overwhelming to pick a program, make a plan, and actually get into the business of goal setting and achievement. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg" alt="Goal Setting" srcset="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg 600w, https://blog.doit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg 1000w, https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/10/GoalSetting-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Goal Setting</figcaption></figure><p>The world is full of overwhelm. Figuring out how to go about setting and achieving your goals is <em>very</em> important, but that doesn't mean it has to be complicated. We aim to make life easier to manage. In honor of simplicity, we have researched goal setting for you and put together an easy-to-follow plan for setting and achieving your personal goals. We even included some tried-and-true tips and techniques that can be modified to fit your unique life.

Do we Need Them?</h2><p>Personal goals are the things we want to accomplish in life. Plain and simple. In a sense, all goals are personal because they are created from within and attached to our greatest desires and aspirations. </p><p>Sometimes they are looked at separately from professional goals, which are specifically related to one’s professional or work life. That being said, personal goals can most certainly take into account goals related to work or career. Here we will focus on personal goal setting and achievement, with the understanding that the term is all encompassing. Make sense? </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>Personal goals are the things we want to accomplish in life. Plain and simple.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Personal goals are unique to every individual because they are, well, personal! Seems obvious, right? Despite that characteristic, it can be helpful to see some examples of personal goals to get started. This can churn up ideas and open the mind to the endless possibilities. Here is an assortment.</p><ul><li>Work out 3-5 times each week.</li><li>Write in a journal every day.</li><li>Fully fund an emergency savings account equal to six months’ living expenses.</li><li>Walk the dog at least once per day.</li><li>Pay off the student loan in 18 months.</li><li>Take a hike 1-2 times per month.</li><li>Travel to a new destination twice each year.</li><li>Cook dinner at home 3 nights per week.</li><li>Fit into my old favorite jeans before my next birthday.</li><li>Stop working full time before 50.</li><li>Train the puppy 15 commands before his 2nd birthday. <br></li></ul><p>You get the idea. Goals can be big, small, long term, or short term. Personal goals can be about daily life, a lifetime, or anything in between. They are unique to <em>what </em>you want, <em>when</em> you want it. Personal goals do have this in common: they make life better, more meaningful, and focused. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>Personal goals do have this in common: they make life better, more meaningful, and focused.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We know what personal goals are but why do we need to set them? Isn’t it enough to have them floating around our heads? Experts say, definitely not! Setting goals sets your mind up for success. Making your goals explicit helps to focus your attention, time, and behavior towards achieving them. You will fail to achieve 100% of the goals you never set. And the very act of writing them down could make all the difference. </p><p>In fact, <a href="https://scholar.dominican.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=news-releases">a study in 2015 by psychologist Gail Matthews</a> revealed that simply writing down goals increased the chances of achieving them by 33 percent compared to having goals that stayed locked inside one’s head. Can your life be purposeful, meaningful, and good without goal setting? Of course it can! But, you have a much greater chance of designing the life you <em>really</em> want by explicitly setting personal goals. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="setting-smart-goals">Setting SMART Goals</h2><p>Not all goals are created equally. You will have a better chance of achieving goals that are carefully crafted. Many experts recommend setting something called SMART goals. SMART is a mnemonic device that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound. </p><ul><li><strong>S: Specific: </strong>Instead of setting a goal to “become wealthy” set a specific goal to “have $1 million invested in a mutual fund by the age of 50.”</li><li><strong>M: Measurable:</strong> The goal should be conducive to metrics. What would it look like to make progress and to fully achieve the goal?</li><li><strong>A: Attainable:</strong> Your goals should be big, but realistic. Aim high but be sure you can hit the target within a specified time frame.</li><li><strong>R: Relevant:</strong> Goals should reflect your values, desires, and abilities.</li><li><strong>T: Time Bound:</strong> Goals should have a deadline that will help organize your efforts and keep you motivated to move forward. <br></li></ul><h2 id="a-simple-system-for-goal-setting">A Simple System for Goal Setting</h2><ol><li>Set one big, huge, overarching goal.</li><li>Set a series of increasingly smaller goals that lead to that big goal.</li></ol><p>Jim Collins is recognized as one of the most influential business book writers of all time. His book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Built-to-Last-Jim-Collins-audiobook/dp/B0813QCVN9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=built+to+last&amp;qid=1601575446&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Built to Last</em></a> was a follow up to the groundbreaking, and now classic, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=good+to+great&amp;qid=1601575412&amp;sr=8-2"><em>Good to Great</em></a>. In it, he and co author Jerry I. Porras introduced a concept that is now widely applied in corporate goal setting. It’s called a <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/bhag.html">BHAG</a>, pronounced bee-hag. </p><p>BHAG stands for Big Hairy Audacious Goal and it challenges corporations and organizations to set their sights on a super large, awe inspiring, borderline outlandish goal that will be the guidepost for decision making within the organization. The writer’s use President Kennedy’s moon landing proclamation as a prime example of a BHAG. </p><p>The author’s wrote, “Like the moon mission, a true BHAG is clear and compelling and serves as a unifying focal point of effort– often creating immense team spirit. &nbsp;It has a clear finish line, so the organization can know when it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for finish lines. &nbsp;A BHAG engages people– it reaches out and grabs them in the gut. &nbsp;It is tangible, energizing, highly focused. &nbsp;People "get it" right away; it takes little or no explanation.”</p><p>There is no reason why BHAG success should be limited to businesses. That’s why we recommend starting by setting a BHAG for yourself. Think of one huge “clear and compelling” star of a dream goal that you can hook all of your efforts and focus onto. Shoot for the stars! Dream big. Make it “audacious.” Above all else, make it <em>yours</em> alone. Every personal BHAG will be unique, but here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>Retire debt free in Costa Rica.</li><li>Become a self-made millionaire.</li><li>Sell my business for enough to set up six-figure trusts for my children.</li><li>Finish in the top ten at the Boston Marathon.</li><li>Compete in three Olympic Games.</li><li>Publish a book that hits the New York Times bestseller list.</li><li>Own a ranch that houses a non-profit animal sanctuary for big cats. </li></ul><p>Write your BHAG down in private and highly visible places. Look at it often. Tell people about it and expect wide-eyed feedback. Your big goal should incite a riot of reactions. If it doesn’t, it may not be big, hairy, or audacious enough. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Now that you have one giant goal to rule them all, you are ready to go to step two. It’s time to set a series of increasingly smaller goals that lead to the big one. Think of your BHAG as the final destination. Along the way, you have to cross a series of obstacles. These smaller goals will be the roads, stepping stones, or trails you will take and the tools and skills you will acquire that are necessary to get all the way there.</p><p>In her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Goal-Guide-Planning-Achieving-ebook/dp/B07T3GZX1S/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=your+goal+guide&amp;qid=1601577717&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFMWTdDQ1c5SjAyNDMmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NTI1ODExUkxDMTAxUkJFVkRSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MzU0Njg5NjBMUTg2UTFNR00md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl"><em>Your Goal Guide</em></a>, author and goal-setting coach Debra Eckerling lays out a highly detailed plan for breaking a big ultimate goal into smaller goals that will keep you on the path to what she calls “GoalTopia.” She recommends that you first determine the long-term goals you will need to achieve in order to reach your final destination. Under each of those long term goals, you will list benchmarks or hurdles that you will need to clear to achieve those long-term goals. Under those benchmarks or hurdles, you will list tasks you need to take care of to clear the hurdles. </p><p>Let’s look at the debt-free retirement in Costa Rica for example. One long term goal might be to pay off an existing mortgage in fifteen years. Under that, you need a list of increasingly smaller goals that may look something like this:</p><p><strong>The Big Goal: Retire debt free in Costa Rica</strong></p><ol><li>Pay off the existing mortgage in fifteen years.</li><li>Make two payments per month equal to twice the required payment.</li><li>Create and stick to a monthly budget.</li><li>Eliminate credit card debt.</li><li>Pay off the car loan. </li></ol><p>Outlines, lists, diagrams, funnels, using <a href="https://doit.io/why-doit/">a digital tool like doit</a>, filling in a goal worksheet: the format you use is entirely up to you. The important thing is to go through the process of taking that one big goal and breaking it down into smaller and smaller bites that can be accomplished steadily as you make your way. </p><h2 id="do-it-5-tips-and-tricks-for-goal-achievement">Do it: 5 Tips and Tricks for Goal Achievement</h2><p>Making the effort to seriously consider and intentionally set personal goals for yourself is a massive step in the right direction. Checking them off your list and getting the work done is the next challenge. In short, it’s time to actually do it. Successful goal achievement is part psychology and part process. Set yourself up for success with some tips and tricks that <em>really</em> work. </p><ol><li><strong>The Psychology of Small Wins:</strong> There is real power in victories, no matter how small. Checking achievements off your goal list delivers a jolt of feel-good chemicals to your brain, such as dopamine. Your brain wants more of that, so you intrinsically become motivated to do it again and again. This is one of the reasons why breaking down goals into ever-smaller steps works so well. The more frequently you get that hit of pleasure, the more motivated you are to get back to work.<br></li><li><strong>Show Up:</strong> The act of simply showing up, no matter how you feel or …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

January 11, 2021 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2021/streaming/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2021/streaming/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>A few months ago I got a feeling that I’d enjoy live streaming some coding. Not sure exactly, but it seemed to be somewhere along the lines of “sitting at home,” “not enough people around to complain to” and things like that. Plus it felt like it could spark some interesting discussions. Maybe. Also, this creates some time-based pressure to do smaller projects — because you’re doing that every Wednesday (or whenever). And doing small things outside of general job-related stuff makes me feel like a person with wider interests. Who am I kidding though, it’s all programming.</p>
<p>The issue here is that I can’t just start doing something suddenly. I can’t just buy a dishwashing machine  — I need to read up on what are the current features and trends and qualities and select the one I like. It’s the same with streaming  — I can’t stream using Macbook cam even though I’m going to sit in a little sector of a video. I need a better webcam so I can feel like it’s for real! So I set to research the topic.</p>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>
<p>And it turns out <a href="https://vsevolod.net/good-webcams/">you can’t buy a good webcam</a>. They are all shit — even if you pay $200+. If you want good picture quality the only way right now is to buy a photo camera with an HDMI capture card. All major brands have released drivers to connect cameras via USB, but those drivers are unanimously bad: USB2 can support compressed 1080p60, but those drivers only support 576p30. What is this madness I don’t know, so you have to use an HDMI capture card.</p>
<p>The capture card could either be some <a href="https://aliexpress.com/item/4000917130635.html">cheap thingie</a> for $15 from Aliexpress, or an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3FN5MR">Elgato Camlink 4K</a> for $130 (or other proper brand-name stuff for even more money). I settled on a cheap crap and it works fine for now: it doesn’t support 4K, and 1080p is also questionable, but the resulting video quality is miles ahead of webcams and phones.</p>
<p>For a camera you have two non-negotiable properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be able to work on AC power. Working on batteries and a charger is insanity when it’s a non-mobile working place.</li>
<li>It should output the so-called “clean HDMI”. This means that HDMI output should contain whatever the camera sees but without all the technical information, which is present on a camera screen — like a shutter speed or a battery level.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second one just out-ruled my otherwise excellent Fuji X-T1, because it outputs only recorded footage at the HDMI port. It was painful to realize, but I went to a local classified site and bought a used Sony a5100 for $250.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why a5100:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sony’s autofocus is the best on the market.</li>
<li>The sensor is good enough. I looked at <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/sony-a5100-sensor-review-uncompromising-performance/">dxomark</a> results and they are almost the same as much newer a6400 and a6600 have.</li>
<li>It has a flip-out screen that flips up 180° (sticking from the top of the camera). Excellent as a self-monitor, because it will work even if some of the components in the path fail.</li>
<li>It’s dirt cheap. It’s an older model made for 6 years already.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’d prefer to have Fuji — their colors are so much better to look at — but I wanted to keep investment low just in case in two months I decide I don’t need it all. And the cheapest Fuji setup would be 2x from a5100 — partially because Sony’s kit lens is so cheaply made, ugh! Also, when I compared a5100 autofocus performance to my beloved X-T1 my jaw just dropped. Reviews suggest that newer Fuji cameras have improved greatly, but still are not on par with Sony.</p>
<h2 id="mount">Mount</h2>
<p>Of course, you can’t just put a camera on your display. Webcams can do that, haha, should’ve gone that way, right? Tripod is an option if you have a place to put it beside a table, but I don’t. So I watched some YouTube videos to see how people mount cameras to film themselves and discovered a Magic Arm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aside</em>: did I tell you I had to watch a lot of videos instead of reading text to discover everything? No? Now I did. It’s a bit painful, but lots and lots of information are in video format only, and text articles about streaming are hard to find and incomplete. I guess including this one. :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<iframe width="400px" height="225px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfE00pXkL8U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Back to the story. I never saw Magic Arms before, but the way they work is magical.</p>
<p>It seems that Manfrotto invented that stuff (can’t find reliable sources, but I recall reading somewhere it was invented in 2008), but now everyone and their grandma are making clones of it. Clones are not even close in terms of quality to Manfrotto’s products (or Matthews Infinity Arm, or other costly brands), but they are cheap! You can get a “decent” one along with a “crab” clamp for around 20-25$ here in Ukraine (and even cheaper on AliExpress). It’s made from aluminum and will die on you if you use it a lot, of course, but the plan is to leave it sitting in place.</p>
<p>So I bought a monitor stand (it was around $30) and put a magic arm there, and a little $4 ball head, and — bam! — camera is looking right at me now.</p>
<h2 id="microphone">Microphone</h2>
<p>They say that there are three important things in a video, in that order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video</li>
</ol>
<p>And… did you know that camera’s mic is the worst mic ever? By a weird coincidence — I tried to make a video with Fuji X-T1 a few times — I already knew that. They pick up weird frequency profiles (to a point where I can’t listen to my voice from those mics), and they are <em>noisy as hell</em>. My MacBook’s mic array is vastly superior to a camera mic! As you can guess to make all that feel more real I need an external microphone.</p>
<p>I knew next to nothing about mics, and I didn’t just want to buy a Blue Yeti because it’s a layman’s choice. Plus I had an audio interface with XLR input and a 48V phantom power<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. So I went to read and watch some videos on mics and after some point stumbled upon <a href="https://www.neatmic.com/bee/worker-bee-microphone/">Neat Worker Bee</a> — see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScI1U3ey9ZY&amp;t=630s">review</a> at Podcastage (which is one of two channels I liked about audio, the other being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/curtisjudd">Curtis Judd</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="worker bee image" height="300px" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iDWBewlfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg"></p><p>It turns out Neat Microphones were a subsidiary of Gibson and made some upper-class mics: like Worker Bee for $200 and King Bee for $300. But after Gibson’s bankruptcy Neat’s CEO (and maybe some others, IDK) was able to buy it out. That CEO  — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipper_Wise">Skipper Wise</a> — is also one of the founders of Blue Microphones. So Neat Mics are independent now and decided to change their pricing strategy. Unfortunately, King Bee is not produced anymore, but Worker Bee is sold for $90, which is a steal! It has loads of glowing reviews on YouTube and the design… it’s funny, and it’s different, and I just like it. Too bad that it’s mostly black from the back (especially sitting in a cradle), so it’s a bit less interesting in a captured video than I hoped. But I bought one anyway.</p>
<p>Other big brands you probably know of — like Audio-Technica and Shure — are great as well. There are some other great companies I’ve never heard of before, like RØDE.</p>
<p>Various tests say that your listeners won’t be able to tell the difference if you have any mic costing from about $100. Do whatever you want with that information.</p>
<h2 id="sound-processing">Sound processing</h2>
<p><img alt="presonus audiobox 22vsl image" src="https://pae-web.presonusmusic.com/uploads/products/media/images/AudioBox_22VSL-02.png"></p><p>I mentioned that I already have an XLR interface to drive the mic — it’s <a href="https://www.presonus.com/products/AudioBox-22VSL">Presonus AudioBox 22VSL</a>. It’s a good interface with reasonably good pre-amplifiers. Can I complain? You bet! I’m an expert complainer<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>!</p>
<p>And the main complaint is that it’s just an audio interface. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p>There are a few things you could do with your voice: de-noise, compression, and equalization.</p>
<p>De-noise is self-describing, but important: when you stream, your laptop is going to make a lot of sound spinning coolers. This generates a lot of background noise which tires your listeners. What’s more important, it drives me mad. This could be done in a simpler way, like noise gate — just silencing signal under some volume level, and in a more intelligent way, learning noise and then trying to clean the whole duration of a recording.</p>
<p>Compression is a really interesting way to improve voice signal: make quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter, “compressing” your sound volume to some middle level. This is good because then your distance to the microphone becomes less important, and what’s especially good — changing distance to a mic is much less pronounced, with a volume level being more stable.</p>
<p>Equalizers are used for two purposes. First is altering the perception of recorded voice — add lows to make it sound fuller, remove them if it sounds “muddy”; add highs to make it airier, remove if it cuts your ears; alter mids for better understanding; you know, usual equalizer stuff. Another one is that mics are not perfect and the recorded voice could have some irritating frequencies. Go see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn6iB1SNvRQ">Curtis' video</a> on that — it’s pretty interesting, but it’s a bit too hard. I tried looking at my recordings but it feels like it needs someone with a trained ear. :)</p>
<p>There are two ways how to do those things: either you’re doing that on your computer or it’s done in a DSP of your audio interface. DSP is vastly superior, of course: it does not add latency, there is no additional load on your CPU, and last, but not least, all your audio receiving apps will receive same processed sound, be it OBS, Zoom, browser or anything else. But, of course, 22VSL has no DSP — it’s just an audio interface! So I have to do all that in software.</p>
<p><img alt="voicemeeter image" src="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/VoicemeeterBananaMixer.jpg"></p><p>For software let’s look at Windows side first. There is an app for Windows called <a href="https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm">VoiceMeeter Banana</a>, which replaces the system mixer and allows you to do all the things you want — compressor, eq, even some de-noising. And then silently sits in the tray. Nothing like that exists for macOS! Every article on the web tells you “get a DAW and put a sound through there”. DAW is something like SoundForge or Cubase or Ableton Live or Reaper. All of them are pretty expensive (Reaper is cheapest from 60$), eat a lot of memory, have highly cryptic interfaces, and are not resident apps. Each and every one of them thinks it’s the <em>main</em> app of your life, eating like 10% of a core just to sit there. Ugh. GIVE ME BANANA!</p>
<h3 id="hardware-way">Hardware way</h3>

<p><a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/music_production/interfaces/ag_series/ag03.html">Yamaha AG03</a> has a 4-line equalizer and a compressor, but no de-noise, which is a shame. I …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Perhaps my favorite time of the year is when the annual Apple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference">WWDC</a> conference occurs. I am heavily inspired by Apple’s Software and Hardware meld, and I truly enjoy nearly every ounce of the conference. But nothing compares to the love I have for the macOS operating system. With it’s deep history and Unix origins, it brings an interesting take on a consumer operating system.</p>

<p>But macOS has one central problem, it’s almost entirely proprietary. macOS consists of <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/">a few open source components</a>, and a majority proprietary components. As someone with a strong Open Source origin and a professional grounding in software companies, it can be hard for me to sympathize with the belief that all software should be Open Source, but at the same time, I’m a curious developer, and I love knowing how things work.</p>

<p>This is what excites me every time a new macOS release is announced. I want to understand the technical foundations and changes on an entusiast level!</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve built a macOS system analysis tool called <a href="https://github.com/kendfinger/jolk">jolk</a>. jolk aims to scan and analyze all the executables found on a macOS installation and reports results about interesting findings.</p>

<p>First, let me dive into the most important note in this entire post. I am doing this purely as an enthusiest. I want to understand what makes up the macOS operating system. For example, I want to understand what daemons run when I use my FaceTime HD Camera on my MacBook Pro, or how the boot process on Apple M1 devices work. There is no intention of malicious use in this tool.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-jolk">What is jolk?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kendfinger/jolk">jolk</a> is a tool which will scan, analyze, and report the executables installed on a macOS system, providing useful details which can help whittle down to interesting aspects of the system. jolk is portmanteau of the words jog and walk. This is an personal inside joke to the time in which I owned the domain <code>idont.run</code>.</p>

<p>jolk combines a system executable finder and an executable analyzer. Using various built-in macOS development tools, you can discover a lot about what is installed on a system. jolk automates that task.</p>

<p>jolk currently supports the following analyzer passes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lipo: discovers what architectures an executable supports using, you guessed it, the <code>lipo</code> tool.</li>
  <li>dynamic linker: determines frameworks and libraries that the executable links to.</li>
  <li>launchd: finds launchd services which reference the executable.</li>
  <li>strings: scans the executable for interesting strings.</li>
  <li>man page: backsearches man pages for mentions of the executable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-can-i-use-jolk">How can I use jolk?</h2>

<p>jolk can be ran by cloning the repository and building the jolk tool with Xcode.</p>

<p>Let’s start with an example usage of jolk to discover what the <code>/usr/libexec/remotectl</code> executable does.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jolk <span>-o</span> remotectl.json <span>-i</span> <span>'/usr/libexec/remotectl'</span>
analyze /usr/libexec/remotectl
<span>complete</span> /usr/libexec/remotectl 253.41ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will produce a JSON report in the file <code>remotectl.json</code> which contains relevant information about the <code>remotectl</code> utility.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"/usr/libexec/remotectl"</span><span> </span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmm, it appears from the entry <code>"strings.likely.has-usage" : true</code> that this command has a usage message, lets run the tool to see if we can capture the usage.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>/usr/libexec/remotectl

usage: remotectl <span>alias</span> <span>(</span><span>type</span>|name|uuid|trait<span>)</span> <span>alias</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It also appears that <code>remotectl</code> links to the framework <code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/RemoteServiceDiscovery.framework</code>, I bet that’s got some interesting uses. Maybe I will investigate other executables later that use this framework. By running jolk without an <code>include</code> flag, we can scan the entire system, and find any executables that link this framework.</p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>

<p>My ultimate goal is for jolk is to be able to scan, diff, and analyze multiple macOS releases to discover what has truly changed about the system between releases. Please don’t hesitate to create issues on the repository for suggestions or improvements.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>jolk is intended to be used for enthusiast analysis of a macOS system. I hope other enthusiasts find this tool interesting and useful.</p>

<p>I like to think about test effort as a benchmark for simplicity. There were 3 layers.</p>
<p>Business logic and persistence layer can be easily integrated and view layer can be browser tested.</p>
<p>You may need a tester, developer, and a designer to maintain something like this. It is realistic to have one person responsible for all of this.</p>
<h2>The AJAX era</h2>
<p>JavaScript opened a door for more considerations in user experience. Adding a dynamic menu, forms, or calendar to a WordPress website was the coolest thing you could do.</p>

<p>We have a complexity spike on the client-side.</p>
<p>Many browsers differed in JS implementation, which required jQuery to come into existence.</p>
<p>This gave a lot of power to designers and has moved more engineering effort into the front end. JavaScript made the browser extensible.</p>
<p>Did the testing complexity increase? Yes. Each new JavaScript bit could only be tested in a browser.</p>
<p>This requires testing, backend programming, JavaScript, and design expertise in your team. Jumping between server-side and client-side languages became frustrating. There was a trend to have different people responsible for each side.</p>
<h2>The Single-page era</h2>
<p>Remember the first example of the Angular.js app? The input field that automatically updated the content of the div? Good times.</p>
<p>Welcome to the single-page era where front-end development became even more complex than back-end development - mostly due to relevant logic moving to the client. As a result, the divide has increased and <a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4">JavaScript fatigue</a> became a thing.</p>

<p>We have ended up with two apps that are tightly coupled.</p>
<p>To maintain this, you need at least someone experienced in testing, backend, frontend development (extensive framework, tooling, and browser knowledge), and design.</p>
<p>Now, two apps have to be maintained, and there is much more code than ever. You have to maintain unit, integration, and end to end tests on both sides. Now business logic is not directly accessible due to security concerns.
Frontend and backend now have to maintain layers that are responsible for communication.</p>
<p>Client code needs lots of API mocks to be tested on lower levels - DOM tests are resource-heavy.</p>
<p>Orchestration becomes difficult because you have to make sure that deployments are synchronized. It is even more difficult if you have separate teams for the backend and frontend.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about browser testing that also can have a lot of overlap with client-side integration tests. Even more, things to consider in terms of complexity and trade-offs.</p>
<p>That resulted in more code, which contributed to - again - increased complexity.</p>
<p>SEO became problematic, but thankfully this problem has been addressed by the ecosystem through <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html">server-side rendering</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydration</a>.</p>
<p>Good patterns have emerged too. UX became better and more creative. We are finally capable of defining client-side logic in a manageable and scalable way.</p>
<p>We all know now that we want to have components and avoid excessive side effects, together with uncontrollable state mutation.</p>
<p>React de facto became a standard.</p>
<h2>Simplicity renaissance</h2>
<p>The remedy to complexity is embracing the coupling and making the developer experience unified.</p>

<h3>Simplicity through innovation in older frameworks.</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails and Laravel are relevant.</p>
<p>Consider them. Their maturity will allow you to move very fast.</p>
<p>They have recently innovated in many interesting ways.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade#components">Laravel’s components</a> or RoR’s <a href="https://hotwire.dev/">Hotwire</a>!</p>
<p>You can have an SPA experience while still writing a unified app!</p>
<h3>Simplicity through new generation of React frameworks.</h3>
<p>People who want to stay in JavaScript land should consider the following.</p>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> started a good trend by putting React and server logic next to each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, which is based on Next, is a good ruby on rails equivalent. It brings the right amount of abstraction that makes you treat your app as a unified whole. Using it sometimes feels like cheating - in a good way. It inspired me to talk about the complexity issue in our ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a> with a fresh take on the problem domain and bringing a lot of good and forgotten patterns.</p>
<h3>React’s Server Components to make everything even better.</h3>
<p>Recently, the React team has presented a new idea that can make our component-driven world better.</p>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html">Consider reading the article and watching their presentation</a>.</p>
<p>When they are released, then we will end up in the best-case scenario where web apps are only dynamic in
places that require it without having to jump between server-side and client-side paradigms.</p>
<p>All of the frameworks above will benefit from them.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>We should start asking ourselves if our standard approach is something we still want to maintain.</p>
<p>Suggested frameworks reduce complexity and allow us to experience the simplicity of older approaches while having the benefits of the modern approach.</p>
<p>They embrace the fact that both backend and frontend are tightly coupled and make the developer experience unified.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to write less code, spend less time testing, simplify orchestration, spend less money on more people having to maintain the complexity, and put more effort into products we are trying to create.</p></section></div>]]>

			<p>Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash<br>
system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending.<br>
It’s completely decentralized with no server or central authority.</p>
<p>See bitcoin.org for screenshots.</p>
<p>Download link:<br>
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rar</p>
<p>Windows only for now. Open source C++ code is included.</p>
<p>– Unpack the files into a directory<br>
– Run BITCOIN.EXE<br>
– It automatically connects to other nodes</p>
<p>If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections,<br>
you’ll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your<br>
firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.</p>
<p>The software is still alpha and experimental. There’s no guarantee<br>
the system’s state won’t have to be restarted at some point if it<br>
becomes necessary, although I’ve done everything I can to build in<br>
extensibility and versioning.</p>
<p>You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on<br>
Options-&gt;Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made<br>
the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so<br>
for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to<br>
generate coins in just a few hours. It’ll get a lot harder when<br>
competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty.<br>
Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be<br>
spent.</p>
<p>There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you<br>
can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public<br>
key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is<br>
not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which<br>
is a hash of their public key that they give you. They’ll receive<br>
the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it’s<br>
in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information<br>
is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used<br>
multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can’t<br>
be online at the same time or the recipient can’t receive incoming<br>
connections.</p>
<p>Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It’ll be distributed<br>
to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half<br>
every 4 years.</p>
<p>first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins<br>
next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins<br>
next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins<br>
next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins<br>
etc…</p>
<p>When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if<br>
needed. It’s based on open market competition, and there will<br>
probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.</p>

January 11, 2021 | https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Haskell is the first programming language we reach for when we build production software systems. This likely seems unusual to anyone who only has a passing familiarity with the language. Haskell has a reputation for being an advanced language with a steep learning curve. It is also often thought of as a research language with limited practical utility.</p>
<p>While Haskell does have a very large surface area, with many concepts and a syntax that will feel unfamiliar to programmers coming from most other languages, it is unrivaled in the combination of developer productivity, code maintainability, software reliability, and performance that it offers. In this post I will cover some of the defining features of Haskell that make it an excellent, industrial-strength language that is well-suited for building commercial software, and why it is usually the first tool we consider using for new projects.</p>
<!--more-->
<h3 id="haskell-has-a-strong-static-type-system-that-prevents-errors-and-reduces-cognitive-load">Haskell has a strong static type system that prevents errors and reduces cognitive load</h3>
<p>Haskell has a very powerful static type system which serves as a programmer aid that catches and prevents many errors before code ever even runs. Many programmers encounter statically typed languages like Java or C++ and find that the compiler feels like an annoyance. By contrast, Haskell’s static type system, in conjunction with compile-time type checking, acts as an invaluable pair-programming buddy that gives instantaneous feedback during development.</p>
<p>There’s a far smaller cognitive load that needs to be maintained when writing Haskell than when writing in languages like Python, JavaScript, or PHP. Many concerns can be completely offloaded to the compiler rather than needing to be remembered by the programmer. For example, when writing Haskell, there’s no need to preemptively ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need to check whether this field is null?</li>
<li>What if fields are missing from the request payload?</li>
<li>Has this string already been decoded to an integer?</li>
<li>What if this string can’t be decoded to an integer?</li>
<li>Will this operator implicitly convert this integer to a string?</li>
<li>Are these two values comparable?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say that these are questions that never need answering in Haskell; it’s to say that the compiler will throw an error when you need to address one of these issues. For example, it’s possible that a Haskell program needs to handle values that are sometimes not present, but instead of setting any value to <code>NULL</code>, a Haskell programmer must use a <code>Maybe</code> type, which indicates that the value may not be there, and the compiler forces the programmer to explicitly handle the <code>Nothing</code> value; the case where the value is not present.</p>
<p>Haskell’s static type system also leads to other benefits. Haskell code uses type signatures that precede its functions and describe the types of each parameter and return value. For example, a signature like <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool</code> indicates that a function takes two integers and returns a boolean value. Since these type signatures are checked and enforced by the compiler, this allows a programmer reading Haskell code to look only at type signatures when getting a sense of what a certain piece of code does. For example, one would not use the type signature above when looking for a function that manipulates strings, decodes JSON, or queries a database.</p>
<p>Type signatures can even be used to search through the entire corpus of Haskell code for a relevant function. Using <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoogle</a>, Haskell’s API search, we can search for a type signature based off of functionality we know that we need. For example, if we need to convert an <code>Int</code> to a <code>Float</code>, we can search Hoogle for <code>Int -&gt; Float</code> (<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Int+-%3E+Float" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a>), which will point us to the aptly named <code>int2Float</code> function.</p>
<p>Haskell also lets us create polymorphic type signatures through the use of type variables, represented by lowercase type names. For example, a signature of <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; a</code> tells us that that the function takes two parameters of two arbitrary types, and returns a value that whose type is the same as the first parameter. Suppose we want to check whether an element is in a list. We’re looking for a function that takes an item to search for, a list of items, and returns a boolean. We don’t care about the type of the item, so long as the search item and the items in the list are of the same type. So we can search Hoogle for <code>a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code> (<a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=a%20-%3E%20%5Ba%5D%20-%3E%20Bool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search results</a>), which will point us to the <code>elem</code> function. Parametric types are an extremely powerful feature in Haskell and are what enable writing reusable code.</p>
<h3 id="haskell-enables-writing-code-that-is-composable-testable-and-has-predictable-side-effects">Haskell enables writing code that is composable, testable, and has predictable side-effects</h3>
<p>In addition to being statically typed, Haskell is a pure functional programming language. This is one of Haskell’s defining features and what the language is well known for, even amongst programmers that have only heard of Haskell but never used it. Writing in a pure functional style has many benefits, and is conducive to a well-organized code base.</p>
<p>The word “pure” in “pure functional programming” is significant. Purity in this sense means that the code we write is pure, or free of side-effects. Another term that describes this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referential transparency</a>, or the property where any expression (e.g.&nbsp;a function call with a given list of parameters) can be replaced with its return value without changing the functionality of the code. This is only possible when such pure functions do not have side effects, such as creating files on the host system, running database queries, or making HTTP requests. Haskell’s type system imposes this sort of purity.</p>
<p>So does being pure mean that Haskell programs cannot have side effects? Certainly not—but it does mean that effects are pushed to the edge of our system. Any functions that perform I/O actions (such as querying a database or receiving HTTP requests) must have a return type that captures this. This means that type signatures like the ones we saw in the previous section (e.g.&nbsp;<code>Int -&gt; Float</code> or <code>a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code>) are indicators that the corresponding functions do not produce side effects, since <code>Float</code> and <code>Bool</code> are just primitive return types. For a contrasting example that includes a side effect, a function signature of <code>FilePath -&gt; IO String</code> indicates that the function takes a file path and performs an I/O action that returns a string (which is exactly what the <code>readFile</code> function does).</p>
<p>Another feature of a pure functional programming paradigm is higher-order functions, which are functions that take functions as parameters. One of the most commonly used higher-order functions is <code>fmap</code>, which applies a function to each value in a container (such as a list). For example, we can apply a function named <code>square</code>, which takes an integer and returns that integer multiplied by itself, to a list of integers to turn it into a list of squared integers:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>square ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">square x <span>=</span> x <span>*</span> x</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>fmap</span> square [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>5</span>] <span>-- returns [1,4,9,16,25]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Code written in this style tends to be both composable and testable. This above example is trivial, but there are many applications of higher-order functions. For example, we can write a function like <code>renderPost</code> which takes a record of post data and returns the version of the post rendered in HTML. If we have a list of posts, we can run <code>fmap renderPost postList</code> to produce a list of rendered posts. Our <code>renderPost</code> function can be used in both the single case and the multi-post case without any changes, because composing it with <code>fmap</code> changes how we can apply it. We can also write tests for the <code>renderPost</code> function and compose it with <code>fmap</code> in our tests when validating the behavior for a list of posts.</p>
<h3 id="haskell-facilitates-rapid-development-worry-free-refactoring-and-excellent-maintainability">Haskell facilitates rapid development, worry-free refactoring, and excellent maintainability</h3>
<p>Through the combination of the aforementioned static types and pure functional style that Haskell has, developing software in Haskell tends to be very fast. One of the common development workflows we employ is relies on a tool called <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ghcid</code></a>, a simple command line tool that relies on the Haskell repl to automatically watch code for changes and incrementally recompile. This allows us to see any compiler errors in our code immediately after saving changes to a file. It’s not uncommon for us to open only a terminal with a text editor and <code>ghcid</code> while developing applications in Haskell.</p>
<p>While manually validating the results of our code is eventually necessary by refreshing a page in a browser or using a tool to validate a JSON endpoint, a lot of this can be deferred until the end of a programming session. Many of the would-be runtime errors a programmer would encounter when writing a web service in a language like Python or PHP are caught immediately and displayed as compiler errors by <code>ghcid</code>. This is a far cry from the need to switch to a browser window and refresh the page after making a change to some code, a development workflow that everyone who has worked on a web application is intimately familiar with.</p>
<p>Beyond the tight feedback loop during development, Haskell code is easy to refactor and modify. Like real world code written in any other language, such code written in Haskell is not write-only. It eventually will need to be maintained, updated, and extended, often by developers that are not the original authors of the code. With the aid of compile-time checking, many code refactors in Haskell become easy; a common refactoring workflow is to make a desired change in one location and then fix one compiler error at a time until the program compiles again. This is far easier than the equivalent changes in dynamically typed languages that offer no such assistance to the programmer.</p>
<p>Proponents of dynamically typed languages will often argue that automated tests supplant the need for compile-time type checking, and can help prevent errors as well. However, tests are not as powerful as type constraints. For tests to be effective, they must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Actually be written, yet many real world code bases have limited testing</li>
<li>Make correct assertions</li>
<li>Be comprehensive (test a variety of inputs) …</li></ol></div></div>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>30 Oct 2020</span></p><p>In this blog post, I’ll try to explain how you can create a really simple installer for your Haskell software on Windows and how to deal with external dependencies.</p>



<p>Alright, let’s get started. We are going to build a simple installer. It will install a desktop shortcut as well as a link shortcut in the start menu.
We will be using <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to build our Haskell project and <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page">NSIS</a> to write the installer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: GHC 8.8.[2|3|4] as well as 8.10.[1|2] are broken on windows so while we wait for 8.10.3 to fix everything, we will have to use 8.6.5 for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Distributing software with external dependencies is slightly more complicated but not uncommon. We will make our project use <a href="https://github.com/lpsmith/postgresql-simple/">postgresql-simple</a> so we can learn how to deal with dependencies <img title=":books:" alt=":books:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>I will assume you have Postgresql, Stack, and NSIS installed already! Also, I’ll be using Powershell as a terminal.</p>



<p>So let’s start by creating a simple dummy project: <code>stack new hello-world-app</code></p>

<p>As said before we want to use GHC 8.6.5 so let’s fix the resolver in <code>stack.yml</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>resolver</span><span>:</span> <span>lts-14.27</span> <span># use ghc 8.6.5</span>

<span>packages</span><span>:</span>
<span>-</span> <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also want to use postgresql-simple so let’s add a dependency in <code>package.yml</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span><span>:</span>
<span>-</span> <span>base &gt;= 4.7 &amp;&amp; &lt; </span><span>5</span>
<span>-</span> <span>postgresql-simple</span>

<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we make our software use only one function which query our postgres DB just to make sure it’s running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings   #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes         #-}</span>
<span>{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}</span>

<span>module</span> <span>Lib</span>
    <span>(</span> <span>isPostgresRunning</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>where</span>

<span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>Database.PostgreSQL.Simple</span>       <span>as</span> <span>PG</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.SqlQQ</span>

<span>isPostgresRunning</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>isPostgresRunning</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>password</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span>
  <span>connection</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>defaultConnectInfo</span> <span>{</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>connectDatabase</span> <span>=</span> <span>""</span>
                                                 <span>,</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>connectUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>"postgres"</span>
                                                 <span>,</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>connectPort</span> <span>=</span> <span>5432</span>
                                                 <span>,</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>connectPassword</span> <span>=</span> <span>password</span>
                                                 <span>}</span>
  <span>_</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>Only</span> <span>Int</span><span>]</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>PG</span><span>.</span><span>query_</span> <span>connection</span> <span>[</span><span>sql</span><span>|</span> SELECT 1 <span>|]</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alright, next we build it with <code>stack build</code> and it should… not work…
Indeed, stack will fail something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;command line&gt;: can't load .so/.DLL for: C:/PROGRA~1/POSTGR~1/13/lib\libpq.dll (addDLL: C:\PROGRA~1\POSTGR~1\13\lib\libpq or dependencies not loaded. (Win32 er)

--  While building package hello-world-app-0.0.0 (scroll up to its section to see the error) using:
      C:\sr\setup-exe-cache\x86_64-windows\Cabal-simple_Z6RU0evB_2.4.0.1_ghc-8.6.5.exe --builddir=.stack-work\dist\e626a42b build lib:hello-world-app exe:hello-world-app-exe --ghc-options " -fdiagnostics-color=always"
    Process exited with code: ExitFailure 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To build our project, stack is telling us that it needs <code>libpq.dll</code>. So let’s add the missing dependencies path to our path.
with Powershell you can use this command: <code>$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\bin"</code>. It will temporarily modify the path variable for the current terminal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can use <code>$env:path.split(";")</code> to print the current value for the PATH variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, now it should build without errors! We can try to execute it as well with: <code>stack exec hello-world-app-exe</code> and… tadaaa <img title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" height="20" width="20">, our project is running! We can save our work and call it a day? <img title=":blush:" alt=":blush:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60a.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>Well, not really no. We still need to build our installer…</p>



<p>I picked NSIS but you might want to investigate other tools as well (<a href="https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup</a> to name one). NSIS documentation felt nice and the fact that it came with examples, tutorials and a simple compiler convinced me into using it.</p>

<p>The idea behind an installer is that you write a script that will explain how to install software. The syntax is quite low level but it’s not that hard either.</p>

<p>So let’s write a simple installer in <code>installer.nsi</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># we start by defining variables</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>APPNAME</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>COMPANYNAME</span> <span>"BestCompanyEver"</span>

<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>EXECUTABLE_NAME</span> <span>"hello-world-app-exe.exe"</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>ICON_NAME</span> <span>"icon.ico"</span>

<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>VERSIONMAJOR</span> <span>1</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>VERSIONMINOR</span> <span>0</span>
<span>!</span><span>define</span> <span>VERSIONPATCH</span> <span>0</span>

<span># create a directory where we will put our assets (eg: image, executable, uninstaller, dependencies...)</span>
<span>InstallDir</span> <span>"$PROGRAMFILES</span><span>\$</span><span>{COMPANYNAME}</span><span>\$</span><span>{VERSIONMAJOR}.${VERSIONMINOR}.${VERSIONPATCH}"</span> <span>#(ie: C:\Program Files\BestCompanyEver\1.0.0\)</span>

<span># Define the installer name</span>
<span>outFile</span> <span>"hello-world-app-installer.exe"</span>

<span>section</span> <span>"install"</span>
	<span>setOutPath</span> <span>$INSTDIR</span>

    <span># copy the executable in the installation directory</span>
    <span>file</span> <span>$</span><span>{</span><span>EXECUTABLE_NAME</span><span>}</span>

	<span># create a start menu shortcut</span>
	<span>createShortCut</span> <span>"$SMPROGRAMS</span><span>\$</span><span>{COMPANYNAME}</span><span>\$</span><span>{APPNAME}.lnk"</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{EXECUTABLE_NAME}"</span> <span>""</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{ICON_NAME}"</span>
	<span># create a desktop shortcut</span>
    <span>createShortCut</span> <span>"$DESKTOP</span><span>\$</span><span>{APPNAME}.lnk"</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{EXECUTABLE_NAME}"</span> <span>""</span> <span>"$INSTDIR</span><span>\$</span><span>{ICON_NAME}"</span>
<span>sectionEnd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Quite concise indeed! We only need to compile it now. We can use the NSIS compiler that will create a <code>hello-world-app-installer.exe</code>.
We can now run the installer and check that our shortcut has been created in the Desktop folder.</p>

<p>Is it done now?</p>

<p><img title=":heavy_check_mark:" alt=":heavy_check_mark:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2714.png" height="20" width="20"> shortcuts have been created<br>
<img title=":heavy_check_mark:" alt=":heavy_check_mark:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2714.png" height="20" width="20"> Installation directory has been created and our executable has been paste inside it<br>
<img title=":x:" alt=":x:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/274c.png" height="20" width="20"> It doesn’t run<br></p>

<p>Indeed, if you try to run the executable, a window should popup with a message like <code>The code execution cannot proceed because LIBPQ.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix the problem.</code>. Which means it’s time to dive into the world of DLLs.</p>

<p>But wait something’s strange. When we executed our program earlier, it was working fine. So what happened meanwhile?<br>
Well, the reason it worked before was that we prefixed the command with <code>stack exec</code> which made sure the executable would find its required dependencies.</p>

<p>We can verify this quite easily.
Let’s copy our executable in a place we can access more easily first: <code>stack install</code>. <br>
For me it copied the executable here: <code>C:\Users\iori\AppData\Roaming\local\bin</code>.<br></p>

<p>Let’s cd inside this folder and run our executable without prefixing it with <code>stack exec</code>. We should see the same error message popping up.</p>

<p>Time to fix this by making sure our executable knows where to find the DLLs it depends on.</p>



<p><code>DLL</code> (dynamic link library) is our runtime dependencies. In our case, because we use <code>postgresql-simple</code>, our project requires some postgresql DLLs that we need to find.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-required-dll">Finding the required DLL</h2>

<p>Many tools can help you list dependencies on windows like <a href="https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies">Dependencies</a> or even <code>ldd</code> if you have <a href="https://cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> installed.
I chose to go with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">Process explorer</a> which can show the dependency of a running process.</p>

<p>So let’s run our project with: <code>stack exec hello-world-app-exe</code>
Then we should find our instance in Process explorer.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.patchgirl.io/assets/img/process-explorer.png" alt="test"></p>

<p>By clicking <strong>View</strong> -&gt; <strong>DLL</strong>, we can list our program DLLs. We don’t need to take care of the DLLs that are in the <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>.
On the other hand, we see that our executable requires 5 postgresql DLL: <em>libpq</em>, <em>libcrypto</em>, <em>libiconv</em>, <em>libintl</em> and <em>libssl</em>.
Those are the DLLs we want for our program. So we can simply copy them into the root folder of our executable and now, running our program without prefixing with <code>stack exec</code> should work fine! <img title=":fireworks:" alt=":fireworks:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f386.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>So are we done now? Not quite so, we still need to update the installer to take the DLLs into account.</p>

<h2 id="copying-dlls-with-nsis">Copying DLLs with NSIS</h2>

<p>We could copy them one by one with <code>File myDll.dll</code> but because we might have a lot of them, let’s just put all our assets into a folder and copy that folder:</p>

<pre><code>section "install"
	setOutPath $INSTDIR

    file "assets\"

    ...
sectionEnd
</code></pre>

<p>We can then, put our DLLs, icon, and executable into the assets/ folder and Now we are truly done! <img title=":sparkler:" alt=":sparkler:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f387.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="really-is-this-the-end">Really? Is this the end?</h2>

<p>Well, this post was intended to be simple but actually, you shouldn’t stop here. You should add to your installer an uninstaller that will take care of removing all the folders/files, shortcuts, and whatnot.</p>

<p>I invite you to read NSIS documentation for that <img title=":blue_book:" alt=":blue_book:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4d8.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>This example is available in the repo <a href="https://github.com/patchgirl/windows-haskell-installer-example">patchgirl/windows-haskell-installer-example</a></p>



<p>For a simple case like this one, writing an installer isn’t too hard. If you don’t need shortcuts/icons and would satisfy with a simple executable that you can run from a terminal, you might want to investigate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed">file-embed</a> to embed any files (picture, documentation,…) within your executable</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://vrom911.github.io/blog/github-actions-releases">Vrom911 blog post</a> to generate executable from Github Action for MacOS/Windows/Linux</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://input-output-hk.github.io/haskell.nix/">Haskell.nix</a> to cross-compile your Haskell project with Nix</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I haven’t tried it but there exists a Haskell package called <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nsis">nsis</a> which provides a more concise DSL to build your script.</p>

<p>I hope this article helps you write more Haskell on Windows!!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a few years since I started writing this blog, and I quite like sharing my thoughts and experiences. After a short while spent on Medium, I decided I wanted to be the sole owner of my content, so I started experimenting with different solutions and ideas. After I finally landed on the “perfect” tech architecture (I know, I’m lying. There’s no perfect solution and Future Me will most likely refactor and (over)re-engineer the current solution), I started to seek the “perfect” writing setup.</p><p>I’m pretty confident I’ve ended up with something worth sharing.</p><h2>A bit about tech stack</h2><p>Before speaking about the setup, I want to spend some words about the tech stack. The site is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/"><strong>Hugo</strong></a>, one of the most popular static site generator. It is a powerful tool that lets you have a website up and running in just a few minutes. With Hugo, you can write articles or content with <strong>Markdown</strong>, and then Markdown pages are automatically transformed into HTML and CSS pages when you build the website. But how Hugo works is not the topic of this article, so if you are interested to know a bit more, I suggest you look over the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">documentation</a>.</p><p>As mentioned above, the final output of Hugo is a static website and there are many free solutions to host it. To name a few: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting">Firebase Hosting</a>. Personally, I’ve always used <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> and I’m still using it. If you have trouble choosing, there is <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/">an entire section on the Hugo doc</a> there to help you.</p><p>For handling the publications, I’ve set up a little <strong>GitHub action</strong> (you can give a look at it <a href="https://github.com/prof18/marcogomiero.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml">on my GitHub</a>) that builds the website and pushes all the changes to a special branch reserved for GitHub Pages. This action is triggered every time I push something on the master branch.</p><p>That’s it for the tech stack. It was a quick but necessary overview to better introduce the context but if you have any kind of question, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p><h2>Writing Setup</h2><p>My main machine is a 15” MacBook Pro - a fantastic tool for my day-to-day job. But after using it for writing some articles, I’ve discovered that a 15” machine is way too heavy, big, and overkill just for blogging.</p><p>When I’m writing something, I like to stay outside in the courtyard, sitting in the deckchair or in the hammock or in a simple chair. And when the weather does not allow it, I prefer to stay on the couch or in bed rather than in my work setup. And in all of these scenarios, my MacBook is too uncomfortable to use. So I started to think about alternatives.</p><p>First of all, I’ve tried to resurrect my old Asus T100HA with a lightweight Linux distro, but in the end I had to drop it due to issues with some drivers and a battery not at its glory anymore. So, after some thinking, I’ve decided to give <strong>iPad</strong> a try: blogging doesn’t require a big screen and CPU power, whereas it does ask for a reliable and comfortable machine, with decent autonomy.</p><p>After some research, I found out that the best compromise between my needs and my budget was the <strong>iPad Air 3</strong> (I made this choice back in May 2020. If it was today, I would choose the new iPad Air 4). For the keyboard, I decided to go with the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/ipad-keyboards/combo-touch.html">Logitech Combo Touch</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/ipad-overview.jpeg"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/ipad-overview.jpeg"></a></figure><p>To be honest, I quickly fell in love with this Logitech solution. With this keyboard-cover, you will transform the iPad into a notebook. With the kickstand, you can tilt the iPad up to 40 degrees. Then you have a very good trackpad (better than some Window notebooks!), a row of function keys (brightness and volume controls, home button, lock button, spotlight, etc), and backlit keys.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/keyboard-detail.jpeg"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/keyboard-detail.jpeg"></a></figure><p>The only compromise is the fact that it makes the iPad a bit heavier and thicker.</p><h3>Applications</h3><p>As I mentioned above, the website is stored in a git repository and I manage all “the git lifecycle” through <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807?l=en"><strong>Working Copy</strong></a> that I think is the best git client that you can find in the AppStore.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-screen.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-screen.png" alt="Working Copy"></a><figcaption><p>Working Copy</p></figcaption></figure><p>With Working Copy you can browse the content of the repo but you can also make edits with a built-in editor that also provides the user with syntax highlighting. However, the feature that made me choose this client is the support of the File iOs app, that makes the repositories browsable from other apps too.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-files-app.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/working-copy-files-app.png" alt="iOs File app"></a><figcaption><p>iOs File app</p></figcaption></figure><p>In this way, I can open and edit an article directly from any Markdown editor - for for the time being my go-to choice is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/mweb-powerful-markdown-app/id1183407767?l=en"><strong>MWeb</strong></a>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/mweb-screen.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/mweb-screen.png" alt="MWeb"></a><figcaption><p>MWeb</p></figcaption></figure><p>I like it because it provides themes, a powerful preview, a useful toolbar with plenty of quick actions, and a lot of keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>In the past, I’ve used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pretext/id1347707000?l=en">Pretext</a>, a little bit more basic. In the future, I would like to try <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/ia-writer/id775737172?l=en">iA Writer</a> but it is quite expensive and I don’t know if it’s worth the investment (maybe if there will be a demo or a trial version in the future I can finally make a decision).</p><p>And that’s it! I write an article in MWeb and when I finish it, I publish it on the master branch of the Github repo through Working Client. Then, the GitHub Action is triggered and the article is live.</p><p>Bonus. If I have to edit or prepare an image for an article (like the ones below), I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pixelmator/id924695435?l=en"><strong>Pixelmator</strong></a>, a very good image editor for iOs.</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png" alt="Pixelmator"></a><figcaption><p>Pixelmator</p></figcaption></figure><h3>Automations</h3><p>After writing some articles, I’ve discovered that there are some boring activities to achieve on iPad, like creating a new article, adding a new image for an article, etc. So, during one of the “its-blogging-time-but-i-dont-want-to-write” sessions (procrastination FTW) I decided to automate some of these boring things.</p><h4>Add an image to an article</h4><p>To show an image on a Hugo Markdown page, it is necessary to write a shortcode; for example, for the Pixelmator’s screen posted above the corresponding shortcode is the following:</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="markdown">{{<span>&lt;</span> <span>figure</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png"</span>  <span>link</span><span>=</span><span>"/img/blogging-ipad/pixelmator-screen.png"</span> <span>caption</span><span>=</span><span>"Pixelmator"</span> <span>&gt;</span>}}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>So, every time I need to add an image to an article, I need to:</p><ol><li>Create a folder into the img folder of the website (if not present. I create a folder for every article just to keep things clean);</li><li>Move the image from the iPad gallery to the folder created above;</li><li>Rename the image with a more readable format;</li><li>Write the shortcode for the image in the article.</li></ol><p>Way too many steps for a lazy person like me!</p><p>To try to automate these steps, I started playing with the <strong>Apple Shortcuts iOS app</strong>. If you’ve never heard about it, I suggest you take a peek. It’s really powerful and it can greatly simplify your life.</p><blockquote><p>A shortcut is a quick way to get one or more tasks done with your apps. The Shortcuts app lets you create your own shortcuts with multiple steps. For example, build a “Surf Time” shortcut that grabs the surf report, gives an ETA to the beach, and launches your surf music playlist. <em><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios">Shortcuts user guide</a></em></p></blockquote><p>After some trials, I was able to achieve my goal and, as you can see in the video, when I need to add an image to an article I can launch a shortcut that does all the job for me.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MdSv-PwC5N8" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>Here’s the “source code” of the shortcut:</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-image-shortcut.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-image-shortcut.png" alt="iOs shortcut to move an image from the camera roll to the repo of the site and generate the Hugo shortcode"></a><figcaption><p>iOs shortcut to move an image from the camera roll to the repo of the site and generate the Hugo shortcode</p></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the image above, it is possible to ask for input and then store it in a variable. So, first of all, I receive as input the name of the image and the folder, then I open the system image picker and I store the chosen image in a variable. Then, before moving the image, I extract the file extension of the image and store it in another variable.
And now finally, it is time to move the image to the specific folder with the new name. This action is performed with the shortcut support provided by Working Copy. And at the end, I create the shortcode for the specific image and I store it in the clipboard ready to be pasted in the article.</p><h4>Create a new article draft</h4><p>Another boring activity is the creation of a new article. That’s because for every article I need to write some metadata at the top, like the date, the title, etc.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="markdown">---
layout: post
title:  "Running a blog with iPad"
date:   2021-01-01
show_in_homepage: false
draft: true
tags: [Blogging]
---
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>So, I made another shortcut!</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v18imNIwgyc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>And here’s the “source code” of this shortcut:</p><figure><a href="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-article-draft-shortcut.png"><img src="https://www.marcogomiero.com/img/blogging-ipad/new-article-draft-shortcut.png" alt="iOs shortcut to create a new article draft with some metadata"></a><figcaption><p>iOs shortcut to create a new article draft with some metadata</p></figcaption></figure><p>The structure is very similar to the other shortcut. First of all, I make sure that I’m in the develop branch of the website where I make all the draft work. Next, I ask for some input that I store in some variables. As you can see it is also possible to do some if/else statements.
And at the end, I create the metadata that will be placed inside the new article.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>And that’s how I write in my blog. I’m very happy with this setup because it let me only focus on writing. Every “boring” activity is completely automated and in this way, I have “just” to write. And by using an iPad I’m not tempted to re-open my IDE to procrastinate writing.</p><p>If you have any kind of suggestions about apps, accessories, whatever, feel free to reach me out on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoGomier">@marcoGomier</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Over the past 3.5 years my career has grown and transformed from Individual Contributor (IC) to an Engineering Manager of multiple teams, and all the roles in between as I built the Azure Sphere Security Services (AS3) Team from 2 people to 20 people.&nbsp; I undertook this journey in the Summer of 2017 to help transform a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/project-sopris-iot-security/">Microsoft Research project, Project Sopri</a>s, into a Generally Available (GA) product <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/">Azure Sphere</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the AS3 Team grew, I went through a massive amount of personal growth and learning as well.&nbsp; In December 2017 I stepped into a manager role for the first time in my career.&nbsp; I had been a professional software engineer for over a decade at this point, and was up for a totally new challenge.&nbsp; I knew that the skills and job of growing and managing a team and then an organization were totally different than what I had been actively developing over the last decade of my career.&nbsp; As I went through this period of growth I was lucky enough to have several friends, coaches, and mentors share their experiences with me, and recommend some great books to help me along my learning journey.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Below is my curated list of the most influential and impactful books that helped me along the way, and that I highly recommend to Engineering Managers&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth &amp; Change by Camille Fournier</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BHEtpF4eL._SY346_.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="450"></figure></div>



<p>This is a must read for anyone considering managing engineering teams, it is as good as or better than the hype surrounding it.&nbsp; The book starts off from the individual contributor perspective and then each subsequent chapter explores the next level of management complexity.&nbsp; Each chapter focuses on an engineering management role, like technical lead, manager of people, or manager of multiple teams, and manager of managers.</p>



<p>Over the past 3.5 years I’ve come back to this book several times, re-reading the chapters around my newest role.&nbsp; For instance when I transitioned into a manager of managers role, I re-read that chapter and the one before and after it.&nbsp; These were great reminders on what I should be focused on, what challenges my directs were facing, and what challenges and motivations my boss was focused on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the sections I really loved was on debugging dysfunctional teams.&nbsp; As an engineer I am a great debugger, often able to piece together logs, metrics, and weird behavior to diagnose what’s going wrong in a system.&nbsp; This was the first time I had seen the term debugging applied to people and organizations, and it helped frame the work of how to start investigating dysfunction in a team, and how to discover the source of the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Honestly I recommend this book to every engineer, solely for the chapter on how to be managed, and what you should and can expect from your manager.&nbsp; Even if you never plan on taking on a management role this book provides an excellent overview of the challenges and motivations of folks in varying levels of an engineering organization and will help you better navigate your org.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Thanks for the Feedback by Douglas Stone &amp; Sheila Heen</h2>



<p>Prior to managing I had given peer feedback as part of performance reviews at various companies, but I did not consider this a strength of mine.&nbsp; Now giving feedback was a critical skill for my role as a manager.&nbsp; Early on I sought out several resources on how to give and receive feedback well, and found “Thanks for the Feedback” to be an tremendous resource.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blackwells.co.uk/jacket/l/9780670922635.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="512"></figure></div>



<p>Thanks for the Feedback is framed as a resource for receiving and processing the multitudes of feedback you receive.&nbsp; However, any one who reads this book, will also learn how to be a more skilled feedback giver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I highly recommend reading the book in its entirety, but I wanted to share one of the fundamental ideas in this book that resonated with me.&nbsp; Feedback is really three different things, with three different purposes:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Appreciation</strong>,&nbsp; the goal is to help people feel appreciated.&nbsp; Sometimes they may just need motivation and encouragement to keep going when tackling tough problems</li><li><strong>Coaching</strong>, the goal is to help the receiver expand their knowledge, sharpen skills, and increase confidence.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Evaluation,</strong> the goal here is to rate or rank the receiver’s work against a set of standards to align expectations and inform decision making.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>This idea that feedback serves a variety of different purposes was eye opening, and help me more clearly think about how and when to provide feedback.&nbsp; Taking this perspective along with the multitude of lessons learned from this book was tremendously helpful to me.</p>



<h2>The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz</h2>



<div><figure><a href="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="2057" data-permalink="https://caitiem.com/image-1/" data-orig-file="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg" data-orig-size="1752,2560" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=205" data-large-file="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=701" src="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=701" alt="" width="251" height="367" srcset="https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=251 251w, https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=502 502w, https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=103 103w, https://caitiem20.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-1.jpeg?w=205 205w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px"></a></figure></div>



<p>The book starts off acknowledging a problem with most management books “they attempt to provide a recipe for challenges that have no recipes.&nbsp; There’s no recipe for really complicated, dynamic situations.”&nbsp; This instantly resonated with me as I was reading it in November 2019.&nbsp; I had been a manager for about two years, and had grown the AS3 team from 2 to 15 people.&nbsp; We’d spent the past two years turning a research project into what would soon be a GA’d product in February 2020.&nbsp; There is no recipe for how to do this, what I was doing was a hard thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horowitz packs the book with a variety of entertaining stories from his career as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur to emphasize his message and points on leadership and various challenges.&nbsp; In addition there are a few key takeaways that have stayed with me.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Take care of the people, the product, and the profits in that order</strong>.&nbsp; This quote resonated with me and the kind of organization I want to build and run.&nbsp; Chapter 5, which bears this quote as a title goes into some of the challenges that can arise when setting out with this mission and how to overcome them, like hiring, training, and management debt.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Part of Management is training your people.</strong> In big companies this is often neglected as it’s the role of HR or corporate to produce training programs.&nbsp; These can sometimes be valuable but are often overly generic.&nbsp; As a manager make sure you are training your people for the specific job they are doing.&nbsp; Things like how to work in your specific code base, what are the architectural standards and guidelines, what makes a good design doc, etc…Make sure you are intentionally designing on boarding programs, meetings, and workshops to facilitate learning.</li></ul>



<h2>Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Accelerate_3D_Shingo-e1567716184319.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="473"></figure></div>



<p>Accelerate is a summary of the research and learnings discovered by Dr Forsgren and her colleagues from the 2014-2017 State of DevOps report.&nbsp; This book is a must read for any engineering leader, as it gives you a clear outline on how to set your team up for success by investing in 24 key capabilities which will drive improvement in your teams software delivery performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some non-surprising findings like using version control is important to team performance, and other not so obvious ones like focusing on continuous integration and software delivery performance positively impacts culture.</p>



<p>This book and the ongoing research released by Dr. Forsgren, et. Al has had a huge influence on the priorities of my team.&nbsp; We embraced Accelerate principles early on in the development of the Azure Sphere Security Services, and that investment has paid huge dividends over time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dare to Lead: Brave Work.&nbsp; Tough Conversations.&nbsp; Whole Hearts. by Brene Brown</h2>



<p>I’m a huge fan of Brene Brown’s work as a shame and vulnerability researcher.&nbsp; In October 2018 she released Dare to Lead applying her research to Leadership.&nbsp; This quote sums up why this book is important</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780399592522-us.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="520"></figure></div>



<p>“There’s an old saying that I lead by now: “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” Brene Brown</p>



<p>This book dives into what it takes to become a brave and courageous leader.&nbsp; Spoiler a lot of it involves embracing vulnerability and living authentically, something that is far easier to say than do.&nbsp; The book defines vulnerability as “the emotion we experience during times of uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure…Vulnerability is not winning or losing.&nbsp; It’s having the courage to show up when you can’t control the outcome.”</p>



<p>One section I continually return to is the definitions of the two leadership styles: armored leadership and daring leadership.&nbsp; Brown’s research uncovered 16 traits for each of these leadership styles and breaks each one of them down.&nbsp; I highly recommend going through these periodically and checking in on your own leadership style and where there is room for growth and improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another great exercise that Brown presents in the book is one around values.&nbsp; She challenges readers to pick one to two core values, not ten or fifteen, because as Jim Collins said “If you have more than three priorities, you have no priorities.”&nbsp; Having clarity around your core values allows you to live and lead more authentically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall this book is one of the best for dealing with the “soft skills” of leadership.&nbsp; How do you show up whole heartedly and help create a team that can do the same is one of the biggest challenges of taking on a management role.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QxTfW8-PL.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="511"></figure></div>



<p>This book is an awesome resource for understanding the psychology and sociology behind what motivates people and how to be successful enacting change from small to epic scale.  I loved this book as it provides real practical tips for how to enact change across a team or organization through researched principles and real world examples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The book starts by acknowledging that people have both emotional and rational sides, and motivating each is important for effective change.&nbsp; In engineering orgs we often only motivate the rationale side, because the analytical brain is all important.&nbsp; Sometimes …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>For those who do not know, having a clipboard history is the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

<p>It is that little feature that allows you, after you made a few copy actions (ctrl+c on Windows or command-c on Mac), to choose any of the copied texts to paste it.</p>

<p>It looks like this when I use <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, a productivity tool on Mac, by pression option-command-c (the three buttons at once).</p>

<p><img src="https://multitasked.net/uploads/2021/302b4c92a6.png" width="480" height="451" alt=""></p>

<p>Just click on the text you want, and it will be copied wherever your cursor happened to be.</p>

<p>You can even search in your clipboard history for something you copied a few days before, as in this screenshot.
<img src="https://multitasked.net/uploads/2021/394bad9b53.png" width="480" height="451" alt=""></p>

<p>This feature is a huge time saver. There is a lot of alternative apps providing this feature and apparently, it’s now a standard part of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/671222/how-to-enable-and-use-clipboard-history-on-windows-10/">Windows 10 too</a>.</p>

<p>Remember all these times where you have to copy a few distinct cells from an Excel file to insert them in a report, and how you switch constantly between the documents? With this feature, you can just copy one by one all the cells that you want, switch to your report (only once!), and paste one by one the values you needed.</p>

<p>Or, are you looking for that email address you sent yesterday? Just open your clipboard history, type a few letters of the name of the person, and there you go, it’s here. You don’t have to open your emails, perform a search, it is just right there, and it very often allows you to stay focused on your current task.</p>

<p>So, you get it, I love it. You should use it. I know I sound like a cheesy salesman here, but that is how convinced I am.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p><strong><em>This is the second part of the “Rebuilding the spellchecker” series, dedicated to the explanation of how the world’s most popular spellchecker Hunspell works.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Quick recap:</strong> <a href="https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html">In the first part</a>, I’ve described what Hunspell is; and why I decided to rewrite it in Python. It is an <strong>explanatory rewrite</strong> dedicated to uncovering the knowledge behind the Hunspell by “translating” it into a high-level language, with a lot of comments.</p>

<p>Now, let’s dive into how the stuff really works!</p>

<p>There are two main parts of word-by-word spellchecker algorithms:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if a word is correct: <strong>“lookup”</strong> part</li>
  <li>Propose the correction for incorrect words: <strong>“suggest”</strong> part</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hunspell also implements several other algorithms to be useful as standalone software. It can extract plain text from numerous formats, like HTML or TeX, split it into words (tokenize), correctly handling punctuation—but at the end of the day, a word-by-word correctness check is applied. I excused myself from implementing “wrapper” algorithms: text extraction and tokenization are thoroughly investigated topics, and there are numerous libraries in any language solving it with decent speed and quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hunspell works on a word-by-word basis (no context is taken into account). Each word is just <strong>looked up</strong> in the <strong>dictionary</strong> loaded from the plaintext  <code>&lt;langname&gt;.dic</code> file in Hunspell-specific format. If it is not considered correct by dictionary lookup (which, as we’ll see soon, is more complex than “is it present in the dictionary”), several algorithms of <strong>suggest</strong> are applied sequentially, trying to find correct words similar to the given one.</p>

<h2 id="hunspells-lookup-algorithm-or-just-look-in-the-dictionary-they-said">Hunspell’s lookup algorithm, or, Just look in the dictionary, they said!</h2>

<p>When coming from English-only spellchecking, the developers tend to perceive the “lookup” part as trivial (e.g., the famous <a href="https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">Peter Norvig’s article</a> starts from the assumption that only the correction—”suggest”—part deserves some explanations). But that’s not quite so.</p>

<p>The first and most straightforward idea<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for the lookup would be: we’ll just take the dictionary (presumably, the flat list of all correct words) and look for our candidate word in this list: if it is there, it is correct. End of story.</p>

<p>Now, Hunspell’s dictionaries exist for many languages and have a plaintext format, which, at the first sight is quite close to a plain word list—so, probably it would be easy to reuse them? Let’s take a look into the <a href="https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/blob/master/en/en_US.dic"><code>en_US.dic</code></a> in the LibreOffice dictionary repository. You’ll see a list of words in the following format:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
acetyl
acetylene/M
ache/DSMG
achene/MS
achievable/U
achieve/BLZGDRS
achievement/SM
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The line <code>ache/DSMG</code> specifies the <em>stem</em> <code>ache</code>, having <code>D</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>G</code> <em>flags</em> associated with it. The meaning of flags is defined by <a href="https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/blob/master/en/en_US.aff"><code>en_US.aff</code></a> (called “affix file”, or just aff-file; every Hunspell dictionary is distributed as a pair of <code>.dic</code> and <code>.aff</code> files).</p>

<h3 id="affix-compression">Affix compression</h3>

<p>In this particular case, all four flags are associated with word <em>suffixes</em>. Here’s the definition of <code>D</code> suffix:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>SFX D Y 4                    # Suffix header: suffix (SFX), with flag D, combinable with prefixes (Y), 4 entries:
SFX D   0  d    e            # * if the stem ends is "e", strip nothing (0), and add "d"
SFX D   y  ied  [^aeiou]y    # * if the stem ends with "y", preceded by non-vowel, strip "y" and add "ied"
SFX D   0  ed   [^ey]        # * if the stem ends with not "e", and not "y", strip nothing, add "ed"
SFX D   0  ed   [aeiou]y     # * "y" with preceding vowel: strip nothing, add "ed"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For our <code>ache</code> stem, this definition says that form <code>ached</code> exists. In the similar fashion, <code>S</code> flag defines that word <code>aches</code> exists, <code>G</code> flag defines <code>aching</code>, <code>M</code> flag defines <code>ache's</code>. So, the <code>ache/DSMG</code> line in <code>.dic</code> file specifies 5 correct words: “ache”, “ached”, “aches”, “aching”, “ache’s”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the fact that flags are similar to the suffixes they define (<code>S</code> flag defines suffix <code>-s</code> and so on) is just a convention. It is rather a handy mnemonics that creators of <code>en_US</code> dictionary used, and there could be any other symbol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the similar fashion, word prefixes might be defined (specified with flags in dic-file, and described with <code>PFX</code> directive in aff-file). Say, this definition:</p>



<p>…defines these forms: <em>advantage, advantage’s, advantaging, advantaged, advantages, disadvantage’s, disadvantaging, disadvantaged, disadvantages, disadvantage</em> (all combinations of four suffixes and a prefix “dis-“).</p>

<p>This technique of “packing” dictionaries is called <strong>affix compression</strong>, and its primary goal is to optimize dictionary size: on disk and in memory. It becomes extremely important for languages with rich inflection. For example, in English one stem might produce no more than ten forms, but in Ukrainian it could easily be dozens or even hundreds, so the amount of possible correct forms quickly grows to tens of millions. “Just a flat list of all known words” <em>might</em> become impractical (not on today’s top MacBook, probably, but still), and that’s where the affix compression comes in handy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not the only possible approach to make dictionary storage more effective: for example, <a href="https://github.com/morfologik/morfologik-stemming">morfologik</a> (the default internal spellchecker of the most widely used open-source proofreading software <a href="https://languagetool.org/">LanguageTool</a>) codes <em>all</em> possible forms in binary files, using finite-state automata. And this approach is very efficient by speed and memory, but very hard for humans to edit and review, and thus, to keep dictionary up-to-date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another benefit of splitting words into stems and affixes: when Hunspell’s user wants to add a new word to their personal dictionary, Hunspell allows to just specify “it is inflected the same way as (some other word)”, thus sparing the user of teaching the dictionary “‘monad’ is a word, and ‘monads’ too, as well as ‘monad’s’…”.</p>

<p>Note, though, that “suffixes” and “prefixes” specified in some language’s dictionary not necessarily correspond to <em>grammatical</em> suffixes/prefixes of the language. The splitting into stems and affixes is deduced automatically by dictionary authoring tools from flat word lists, so it is up to probabilities whether “common endings” deduced have any grammatical meaning. Actually, Hunspell’s format has a rich <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/libhunspell-dev/hunspell.5.en.html#Optional_data_fields">sub-language to specify grammatical information</a>, but of all LibreOffice and Firefox dictionaries I’ve checked, only a few (Latvian, Slovak, Galician, Breton) made use of this feature.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One important factor to mention is Hunspell’s limitation for the amount of suffixes/prefixes a word may have. Currently, the software understands no more than 2 suffixes and 2 prefixes in a word, which is lower than the common number of grammatical suffixes a lot of languages allow. Most of the dictionaries solve this by “linearizing” the word list: Ukrainian word “громадянство” (citizenship) grammatically consists of the stem “громад-“ and suffixes “-ян-“, “-ств-“, “-о” (the latter is called an ending in grammatically correct terms), but Hunspell’s Ukrainian dictionary includes the full word “громадянство”. For other languages, the suffix number limitation makes Hunspell totally unusable, so to spellcheck the Finnish, you need to install <a href="https://voikko.puimula.org/">Voikko</a> spellchecker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Affix compression comes with a price</strong> paid in lookup algorithm complexity and performance. Instead of just a quick lookup through a hashtable or other lookup-optimized structure, we now have to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check if the whole word is in the list of stems. If yes, it is correct,
    <ul>
      <li>…unless it has a flag corresponding to the aff-file directive “this stem <em>requires</em> prefixes or suffixes”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If no, check if the word has some of the known suffixes; and if so, whether the stem without one of those suffixes is in the stem list, <em>and</em> has a flag corresponding to this suffix.</li>
  <li>If no, check if one more suffix can be found in the stem (then we’ll have a stem and two suffixes, and need to check the compatibility of their flags).</li>
  <li>Repeat with prefixes (up to two), and with all possible suffix-prefix combination (taking into account whether suffix and prefix both have “cross-product” allowed).</li>
  <li>Consider that suffixes and prefixes can have flags of their own, specifying “suffixes with this flag might be attached after me”, or “if used, this suffix requires that at least one other affix would be present” and … many other things.</li>
  <li>And there are funny cases like <code>CIRCUMFIX</code> flag: if the suffix has it, this means that this suffix is only allowed in words having a prefix with the same flag.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is <em>still</em> a simplified description. To follow the algorithm in full, you can read Spylls docs starting from <a href="https://spylls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hunspell/algo_lookup.html#spylls.hunspell.algo.lookup.Lookup.affix_forms"><code>Lookup.affix_forms</code></a>, follow the links to methods it invokes, and read inline comments under “Show code”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Performance-wise, for each word correctness check, there could be many lookups through known suffixes and prefixes lists, and quite a few dictionary lookups (as consecutive chopping off of suffixes and prefixes produces new stems we need to check).</p>

<p>And once you tackle the affixes problem, it is all uphill from there!</p>

<p><strong>Stay tuned for the next installment about the Hunspell lookup, where we’ll cover word compounding problem, and some other important edge cases of the word correctness check.</strong> Follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/zverok">on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://zverok.github.io/subscribe.html">subscribe to my mailing list</a> if you don’t want to miss the follow-up!</p>

<h2 id="import-assertions">Import assertions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The motivating use case for import assertions was importing JSON data as a module. That looks as follows (and is further specified in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules">a separate proposal</a>):</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./data/config.json'</span> assert { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> };
</code></pre>
<p>You may wonder why a JavaScript engine can’t use the filename extension <code>.json</code> to determine that this is JSON data. However, a core architectural principle of the web is to never use the filename extension to determine what’s inside a file. Instead, content types are used.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a risk of doing importing wrong if a server has incorrectly configured content types. Specifying the necessary metadata at the import location solves this issue.</p>
<p>Before we take a more detailed look at how import assertions work, let’s examine the history of importing non-JavaScript artifacts in the world of JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="history%3A-importing-non-javascript-artifacts-as-modules">History: importing non-JavaScript artifacts as modules&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Importing artifacts that are not JavaScript code as modules, has a long tradition in the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, the JavaScript module loader RequireJS has support for so-called <a href="https://requirejs.org/docs/plugins.html"><em>plugins</em></a>. To give you a feeling for how old RequireJS is: Version 1.0.0 was released in 2009. Specifiers of modules that are imported via a plugin look like this:</p>
<pre><code>'«specifier-of-plugin-module»!«specifier-of-artifact»'
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the following module specifier imports a file as JSON:</p>
<pre><code>'json!./data/config.json'
</code></pre>
<p>Inspired by RequireJS, webpack supports the same module specifier syntax for its <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/"><em>loaders</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-for-importing-non-javascript-artifacts">Use cases for importing non-JavaScript artifacts&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>These are a few use cases for importing non-JavaScript artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importing JSON configuration data</li>
<li>Importing WebAssembly code as if it were a JavaScript module</li>
<li>Importing CSS to build user interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>For more use cases, you can take a look at <a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/">the list of webpack’s loaders</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-syntax-of-import-assertions">The syntax of import assertions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Let’s examine in more detail what import assertions look like.</p>
<h3 id="static-import-statements">Static import statements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We have already seen a normal (static) import statement:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> config <span>from</span> <span>'./data/config.json'</span> assert { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> };
</code></pre>
<p>The import assertions start with the keyword <code>assert</code>. That keyword is followed by an object literal. For now, the following object literal features are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unquoted keys and quoted keys</li>
<li>The values must be strings</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no other syntactic restrictions placed on the keys and the values, but engines are encouraged to throw an exception if they don’t support a key and/or a value. That makes it easier to add more features in the future because no one will use keys and values in unexpected ways.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-imports">Dynamic imports&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>To support import assertions, <a href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_modules.html#import-operator">dynamic imports</a> get a second parameter – an object with configuration data:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span>(<span>'./data/config.json'</span>, { <span>assert</span>: { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> } })
</code></pre>
<p>The import assertions don’t exist at the top level; they are specified via the property <code>assert</code>. That makes it possible to add more configuration options in the future.</p>
<h3 id="re-export-statements">Re-export statements&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A re-export imports and exports in a single step. For the former, we need assertions:</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> { <span>default</span> <span>as</span> config } <span>from</span> <span>'./data/config.json'</span> assert { <span>type</span>: <span>'json'</span> };
</code></pre>
<h2 id="upcoming-features-based-on-import-assertions">Upcoming features based on import assertions&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Import assertions are really just syntax. They lay the foundation for actual features that make use of that syntax.</p>
<p>The first feature based on import assertions is probably going to be <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules">JSON modules</a>.</p>
<h3 id="importing-webassembly">Importing WebAssembly&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Whether or not import assertions will be used to support directly importing WebAssembly from JavaScript is currently under <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions/issues/19">discussion</a>. If they are used, we’ll probably be able to create web workers like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>new</span> Worker(<span>'my-app.wasm'</span>, { <span>type</span>: <span>'module'</span>, <span>assert</span>: { <span>type</span>: <span>'webassembly'</span> } })
</code></pre>
<p>And we’d also need import assertions in HTML script elements:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"my-app.wasm"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"module"</span> <span>asserttype</span>=<span>"webassembly"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="further-reading-on-modules">Further reading on modules&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_modules.html">The chapter on “Modules”</a> in “JavaScript for impatient programmers” is an in-depth introduction to ECMAScript modules.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3
</li></ul><p>Some tools to check out include:

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking5.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Our traveling studio has operated off-the-grid since 2016.</p>

<p>For the first 3 years we tested the limits of our space, and at first, it was difficult to create new things, as we had to make time to learn how to solve the underlying problems. Our boat was not just an office, it was also our house and transport. As for us, we were artists, but also had to be plumbers, deckhands, electricians, captains, janitors and accountants.</p>

<p>Our main problems as a studio were <b>internet scarcity</b>, <b>power management</b>, <b>data storage</b> as well as <b>hardware</b> and <b>software failures</b>. Overtime we found ways to balance work, pleasure and maintenance. Here are some of the lessons we learnt.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power management</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking6.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Our work schedule is tied to the weather, as we depend on solar energy to power our computers. By looking at the forecast, we can determine when we will get the most work done: consecutive days of sun grant us enough power for video-editing, while overcast days are reserved for low-power work, like writing, coding and planning.</p>

<p>There are times when we must resort to secondary power sources, like our small generator or our engine's alternator, but we tend to prefer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ua_qxjbBTc">wait for the sun to return</a>. Waiting hasn’t affected our productivity, as we don't adhere to strict 8-hour workdays.</p>

<p>We tend to work only in the morning, leaving us time to pursue other interests in the afternoon. In our old life, we found that the 40-hour workweek ﻿<a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/" target="_blank">kept free-time scarce</a>, resulting in us spending more for convenience, gratification and distraction.</p>

<p>Computers are generally power-sucking vampires. Choosing different softwares, operating systems, or working from machines with a lower draw (ARM) or even throttling the CPU, are some of the many things we do to lower our power requirements. The way that software is built has a substantial impact on the power consumption of a system, it is shocking how cpu-intensive modern programs can be.</p>

<p>Choosing software designed for low-end PCs is a good solution, it is also possible to throttle processes on your machine by using a ‘throttling controller’. The basic idea is like the throttle in a car, it allows to set the rate at which your system will operate and consume power. Another sure way to save battery is to limit multitasking. Disabling notifications, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/noscript/">scripts</a>, auto-playing videos or using internet browsers without opening multiple tabs at once are some of the many ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>Power consumption is also something to consider when choosing a computer. In evenings, if we need to work on light tasks, we switch to our low-power machines like the <a href="https://100r.co/site/raspberry_pi.html">Raspberry Pi</a>. To illustrate the difference in power draw, a Pi4 uses 2.85 W when idle, while a Macbook Pro uses 6-12 W. Raspberry Pis are backups to our main computers, as they are inexpensive and can run off small batteries.</p>

<h2 id="internet">Internet</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking1.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Internet access is the woe of any working nomad. Internet is sometimes spotty, and data in some countries is slow, expensive, or limited to small blocks at a time. While circumnavigating the Pacific, we amassed sim cards, pocket WiFis, and have often used connections from businesses on land. Overtime, we found ways to lessen our dependence on internet, and to save on bandwidth.</p>

<p>With limited access, it is important to use online time wisely. Prior to connecting we make a list of tasks that we must do, such as pushing updates and making backups of our data online. It’s easy to get side-tracked on the internet, with websites designed to grab and keep our attention. When checking social media, we disable auto-playing videos and image previews to save bandwidth.</p>

<p>When we have a reliable internet connection, we gather copies of all the online material we will need. We keep offline versions of entire websites, writing guides, articles and even whole sections of Wikipedia. If we find ourselves without a connection, we can still solve our problems by using our offline mirrors. By the way, you can <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/master.zip">download our entire website</a>.</p>

<p>We research our destinations ahead of time to make sure we’ll have a reliable connection when we need it. This means we’ll be spending less time in secluded areas, and more time in city centers near a cell tower or WiFi signal. With some planning it is possible to have both paradise and connectivity, we found such a place in <a href="https://100r.co/site/internet_in_paradise.html#internet">Huahine</a> in French Polynesia, and again in Fiji. Internet access will only get better as far-flung island nations gain purchasing power.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data storage</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/dworking2.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Hardware failure is common on boats due to the hostile environment. Saltwater is the kryptonite of electronics. This is why it is important to backup data often to avoid losing work. There are advantages and disadvantages with all methods of data storage, but I’ll outline the most useful ones:</p>

<p><b>Cloud storage:</b> For a fee, you can back up your data online and sync files from your desktop. This method doesn’t eliminate physical storage as data can’t be synced to the cloud without a connection. Offloading data storage to a centralized service is problematic in other ways, because services have rules and owners and processes which can complicate things. For instance, country politics have made it that Google restricts access to some of its business services in certain countries or regions, such as China, Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. Whatever data you have stored with Google Drive, if traveling to any of these countries will not be accessible. As conflicts arise, more countries can end up on that list. We keep documents we don’t need regular access to on the cloud, with copies on hard disks.</p>

<p><b>Hard copies:</b> Paper is a stable and widely accessible material, unlike digital devices which are subject to breakages and obsolescence. There’s a good reason books and other documents from centuries ago are still readable today. We like to keep printed copies of websites and other online reference materials, such as grammar guides for writing, or language manuals for coding. Keeping data like this means we always have access and aren’t limited to our computer’s battery.</p>

<p><b>External hard drives:</b> A hard drive is the best balance of practical and reliable for storage. However, hard drives are rated for a limited number of read/write cycles, and can be expected to fail eventually. To prevent data loss due to HD failure, it’s a good idea to store the same data across multiple hard drives.</p>

<p><b>Offline databases:</b> Keeping an offline collection of websites on computers or HD ensures constant access, and reduces the energy associated with re-loading them repeatedly. It’s possible to save web pages with most browser by selecting File &gt; Save Page As. To access the page offline, click on the HTML file. Another option is to mirror entire web sites using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">command-line tools</a>. We keep offline databases full of notes on a variety of subjects to refer to when there’s no internet.</p>
<p>For those who need a vast quantity of reference materials, it's possible to setup an <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_does_Internet-in-a-Box_.28IIAB.29_help.3F" target="_blank">internet in the box</a> on your boat. In short, it permits you to browse through the World’s Free Knowledge (Wikipedia, Khan Academy, OpenStreetMap, E-Books and many others) while offline. You can install an internet-in-a-box using very diverse hardware, like on a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/internet-in-a-box-raspberry-pi" target="_blank">Raspberri Pi</a> or on a terabyte HD with a built-in hotspot. This system was originally designed for students with restricted internet access and people in remote areas of the world not served by broadband. You can buy one, or better yet <a href="https://www.kiwix.org/en/" target="_blank">create a digital library</a> filled with content tailored to your needs. This might be especially useful for sailors who homeschool.</p>

<p>Keeping files on the cloud, on hard drives and hard copies gives our floating studio the redundancy required to ensure reliability.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Software has a big impact on productivity, they need to be reliable and fast. Those that require heavy updates, that have a high CPU usage and that need frequent connectivity to function are problematic for working sailors.</p>

<p>Much of the software on the market is designed by people living on the grid with unlimited access to internet. Tools locking up at sea, asking for a connection to continue working don’t float on a boat. Adobe products are a good example, as they require an internet connection periodically for subscription validation. If away from big cities, you may open your computer in an atoll to find that you no longer have access to the tool you need to get things done. Choosing a tool that doesn’t require a subscription is <b>essential</b> for working nomads that don’t have a reliable connection.</p>

<p>In our first year, we struggled to download the frequent and mandatory 10GB software updates from Apple to release our software on their platform, while on slow Polynesian internet. Processor-intensive software or apps is a strain on limited power and bandwidth, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The way developers write them can affect the power consumption of the resulting product. Chat rooms and bare bones text editors aren’t supposed to be process-heavy, and yet the popular communication platform Slack requires <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop/" target="_blank">outrageous amounts of ram and CPU</a> to function. This is because Slack is embedding the entirety of Google Chrome in their app. Making software this way is costly to off-grid users, or those on slow connections, but luckily there are <a href="https://github.com/mayfrost/guides/blob/master/ALTERNATIVES.md" target="_blank">many alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>Our computer batteries should not need to grow ever larger only to support these bloatwares, nor should we need to add extra solar to power them. Just as you would look at the nutritional content of food products at the grocery store, find out how much energy your apps are consuming.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/blog/working/working3.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Computers are subject to water intrusion and saltwater corrosion, but with some care they can survive in a normal marine environment. We solved most of the problems by cleaning external connections often, and by storing them in a sealed box with some desiccants after each use. The main issue with …</p></div></div>

<p>I strive to respect everybody’s personal preferences, so I usually steer clear
of debates about which is the best programming language, text editor or
operating system.</p>

<p>However, recently I was asked a couple of times why I like and use a lot of <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, so here is a coherent article to fill in the
blanks of my ad-hoc in-person ramblings :-).</p>

<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>

<p>I have used C and Perl for a number of decently sized projects. I have written
programs in Python, Ruby, C++, CHICKEN Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Rust and Java (for
Android only). I understand a bit of Lua, PHP, Erlang and Haskell. In a previous
life, I developed a number of programs using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)">Delphi</a>.</p>

<p>I had a brief look at Go in 2009, when it was first released. I seriously
started using the language when Go 1.0 was released in 2012, featuring the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">Go 1
compatibility guarantee</a>. I still have
<a href="https://github.com/stapelberg/greetbot">code</a> running in production which I
authored in 2012, largely untouched.</p>

<h2 id="1-clarity">1. Clarity</h2>

<h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3>

<p>Go code, by convention, is formatted using the
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/"><code>gofmt</code></a> tool. Programmatically formatting code
is not a new idea, but contrary to its predecessors, <code>gofmt</code> supports precisely
one canonical style.</p>

<p>Having all code formatted the same way makes reading code easier; the code feels
familiar. This helps not only when reading the standard library or Go compiler,
but also when working with many code bases — think Open Source, or big
companies.</p>

<p>Further, auto-formatting is a huge time-saver during code reviews, as it
eliminates an entire dimension in which code could be reviewed before: now, you
can just let your continuous integration system verify that <code>gofmt</code> produces no
diffs.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, having my editor apply <code>gofmt</code> when saving a file has
changed the way I write code. I used to attempt to match what the formatter
would enforce, then have it correct my mistakes. Nowadays, I express my thought
as quickly as possible and trust <code>gofmt</code> to make it pretty
(<a href="https://play.golang.org/p/I6GJwiT77v">example</a> of what I would type, click
Format).</p>

<h3 id="high-quality-code">High-quality code</h3>

<p>I use the standard library (<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/">docs</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src">source</a>) quite a bit, see below.</p>

<p>All standard library code which I have read so far was of extremely high quality.</p>

<p>One example is the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/image/jpeg/"><code>image/jpeg</code></a> package: I
didn’t know how JPEG worked at the time, but it was easy to pick up by switching
between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">Wikipedia JPEG article</a> and the
<code>image/jpeg</code> code. If the package had a few more comments, I would qualify it as
a teaching implementation.</p>

<h3 id="opinions">Opinions</h3>

<p>I have come to agree with many opinions the Go community holds, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#variable-names">Variable names</a> should be short by default, and become more descriptive the further from its declaration a name is used.</li>
<li>Keep the dependency tree small (to a reasonable degree): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&amp;t=9m28s">a little copying is better than a little dependency</a></li>
<li>There is a cost to introducing an abstraction layer. Go code is usually rather clear, at the cost of being a bit repetitive at times.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments">CodeReviewComments</a> and <a href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/">Go Proverbs</a> for more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="few-keywords-and-abstraction-layers">Few keywords and abstraction layers</h3>

<p>The Go specification lists only <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Keywords">25
keywords</a>, which I can easily keep in my
head.</p>

<p>The same is true for <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/">builtin functions</a> and
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types">types</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience, the small number of abstraction layers and concepts makes the
language easy to pick up and quickly feel comfortable in.</p>

<p>While we’re talking about it: I was surprised about how readable the <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec">Go
specification</a> is. It really seems to target
programmers (rather than standards committees?).</p>

<h2 id="2-speed">2. Speed</h2>

<h3 id="quick-feedback-low-latency">Quick feedback / low latency</h3>

<p>I love quick feedback: I appreciate websites which load quickly, I prefer fluent
User Interfaces which don’t lag, and I will choose a quick tool over a more
powerful tool any day. <a href="https://blog.gigaspaces.com/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/">The
findings</a>
of large web properties confirm that this behavior is shared by many.</p>

<p>The authors of the Go compiler respect my desire for low latency: compilation
speed matters to them, and new optimizations are carefully weighed against
whether they will slow down compilation.</p>

<p>A friend of mine had not used Go before. After installing the
<a href="https://robustirc.net/">RobustIRC</a> bridge using <code>go get</code>, they concluded that Go
must be an interpreted language and I had to correct them: no, the Go compiler
just is that fast.</p>

<p>Most Go tools are no exception, e.g. <code>gofmt</code> or <code>goimports</code> are blazingly fast.</p>

<h3 id="maximum-resource-usage">Maximum resource usage</h3>

<p>For batch applications (as opposed to interactive applications), utilizing the
available resources to their fullest is usually more important than low latency.</p>

<p>It is delightfully easy to profile and change a Go program to utilize all
available IOPS, network bandwidth or compute. As an example, I wrote about
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2014/01/17/debmirror-rackspace.html">filling a 1 Gbps
link</a>,
and optimized <a href="https://github.com/Debian/debiman/">debiman</a> to utilize all
available resources, reducing its runtime by hours.</p>

<h2 id="3-rich-standard-library">3. Rich standard library</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://golang.org/pkg">Go standard library</a> provides means to effectively
use common communications protocols and data storage formats/mechanisms, such as
TCP/IP, HTTP, JPEG, SQL, …</p>

<p>Go’s standard library is the best one I have ever seen. I perceive it as
well-organized, clean, small, yet comprehensive: I often find it possible to
write reasonably sized programs with just the standard library, plus one or two
external packages.</p>

<p>Domain-specific data types and algorithms are (in general) not included and live
outside the standard library,
e.g. <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net/html"><code>golang.org/x/net/html</code></a>. The
<code>golang.org/x</code> namespace also serves as a staging area for new code before it
enters the standard library: the Go 1 compatibility guarantee precludes any
breaking changes, even if they are clearly worthwhile. A prominent example is
<code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code>, which had to break existing code to <a href="https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/e4e2799dd7aab89f583e1d898300d96367750991">establish a more
secure
default</a>.</p>



<p>To download, compile, install and update Go packages, I use the <code>go get</code> tool.</p>

<p>All Go code bases I have worked with use the built-in
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/"><code>testing</code></a> facilities. This results not only
in easy and fast testing, but also in <a href="https://blog.golang.org/cover">coverage
reports</a> being readily available.</p>

<p>Whenever a program uses more resources than expected, I fire up <code>pprof</code>. See
this <a href="https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs">golang.org blog post about
<code>pprof</code></a> for an introduction, or
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2014/12/23/code-search-taming-the-latency-tail.html">my blog post about optimizing Debian Code
Search</a>. After
importing the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/"><code>net/http/pprof</code>
package</a>, you can profile your server
while it’s running, without recompilation or restarting.</p>

<p>Cross-compilation is as easy as setting the <code>GOARCH</code> environment variable,
e.g. <code>GOARCH=arm64</code> for targeting the Raspberry Pi 3. Notably, tools just work
cross-platform, too! For example, I can profile <a href="https://gokrazy.org/">gokrazy</a>
from my amd64 computer: <code>go tool pprof ~/go/bin/linux_arm64/dhcp
http://gokrazy:3112/debug/pprof/heap</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc">godoc</a> displays documentation
as plain text or serves it via HTTP. <a href="https://godoc.org/">godoc.org</a> is a public
instance, but I run a local one to use while offline or for not yet published
packages.</p>

<p>Note that these are standard tools coming with the language. Coming from C, each
of the above would be a significant feat to accomplish. In Go, we take them for
granted.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Hopefully I was able to convey why I’m happy working with Go.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in getting started with Go, check out <a href="https://github.com/gopheracademy/gopher/blob/1cdbcd9fc3ba58efd628d4a6a552befc8e3912be/bot/bot.go#L516">the beginner’s
resources</a>
we point people to when they join the Gophers slack channel. See
<a href="https://golang.org/help/">https://golang.org/help/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>Of course, no programming tool is entirely free of problems. Given that this
article explains why Go is my favorite programming language, it focuses on the
positives. I will mention a few issues in passing, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you use Go packages which don’t offer a stable API, you might want to use a specific, known-working version. Your best bet is the <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a> tool, which is not part of the language at the time of writing.</li>
<li>Idiomatic Go code does not necessarily translate to the highest performance machine code, and the runtime comes at a (small) cost. In the rare cases where I found performance lacking, I successfully resorted to <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a> or assembler. If your domain is hard-realtime applications or otherwise extremely performance-critical code, your mileage may vary, though.</li>
<li>I wrote that the Go standard library is the best I have ever seen, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have any problems. One example is <a href="https://golang.org/issues/20744">complicated handling of comments</a> when modifying Go code programmatically via one of the standard library’s oldest packages, <code>go/ast</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Electrostatic lifters are fascinating devices that have become popular construction projects for experimenters all over the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA’s recent patent on a type of lifter design has&nbsp; spurred further&nbsp; interest in these devices.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="lifter_2" src="https://electricmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/lifter_2.jpg" alt="lifter_2" width="371" height="268"></p>
<h3><span>What is a lifter?</span></h3>

<p><span> The basic device merely consists of a lightweight (typically balsa wood) frame, to which is attached a wire and a sort of aluminum foil skirt. The photos on this page&nbsp; illustrate this. The wire is charged to approximately 30,000 volts by means of a power supply and very thin wire attached to the corona wire. The aluminum foil skirt is coneccted to ground by a thin wire as well. When the device is powered it developes downward thrust and levitates.</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" title="lifter_1" src="https://electricmuseum.com/wp-content/uploads/lifter_1.jpg" alt="lifter_1" width="540" height="306"><figcaption>Lifter being powered by a 50kV DC supply operated at approximately 25kV. Not visible is the thin positively charged “corona wire” which is strung above, and parallel to, the flat negatively charged aluminum “skirt”.</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span>How does it work?</span></h3>
<p><span>T</span><span>he device levitates by creating an electrostatic “wind”. This is caused as the thin positively charged corona wire ionizes the air surrounding it which is then repelled from the corona wire and pulled towards the negtively charged “skirt”. The force of this ion wind combined with the impact of the moving ions on the surrounding air creates an upward thrust. This is essentially how some of the “ionic breeze” air purifiers work that you may have seen in catalogs.</span></p>
<p><span>A well known effect called dielectrophoresis may also contribute to the device’s thrust. This is an effect whereby dielectric material in an asymmetrc electric field becomes polarized and moves towards the larger electrode. In a fluid dielectric medium such as air or liquid, dielectrophoresis can cause a continuous flow of dieletric material from one electrode to another. The more intense the electric field the greater the effect. Dieletrophoresis is consitent with experiemental results shown by encapsulating the electrodes.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>At Modfy, we are developing a desktop wrapper for <a href="http://modfy.video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">modfy.video</a> and I wanted to share how to package FFmpeg with Electron using Webpack. I think there is a lot of good work based around this, but it wasn’t very clearly documented, and I ran into a lot of issues, so I thought I’d document what I used here.</p><h2 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h2><h2 id="electron">Electron</h2><p>I really like typescript and react, so I’d recommend using this boilerplate, as it does a lot of the heavy lifting in that regard.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react</a></p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/diego3g/electron-typescript-react.git project</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="ffmpeg">FFmpeg</h2><p>To ship a binary like FFmpeg with an application, we need to use the concept of static binaries. These are essentially binaries compiled with all their dependencies into one file that can be directly executed. Thankfully we don’t need to make these binaries ourselves, as other people have done the great work of compiling these binaries.</p><p>For example, the linux binaries are compiled here: <a href="https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/</a></p><p>These binaries can be used wherever you’d like inside any ffmpeg wrapper, such as <em>fluent-ffmpeg</em>, or calling them yourself inside a <em>child.spawn</em> . For the rest of the tutorial we are going to demo this using <em>fluent-ffmpeg</em>, but it shouldn’t really change anything.</p><p>We can find all these static binaries bundled together for us in this repo: <a href="https://github.com/pietrop/ffmpeg-static-electron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/pietrop/ffmpeg-static-electron</a></p><p>It does a great job setting things up, but can be improved for the final compile step to actually import the files into electron correctly.</p><h2 id="building">Building</h2><h2 id="electron-builder">Electron-builder</h2><p>The boilerplate uses <code>electron-builder</code> to build out electron, which simplifies quite a bit but can still be a lot to learn and figure out. The documentation on <a href="http://electron.build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">electron.build</a> is a good place to start.</p><p>The boilerplate will give you this within your build step in <code>package.json</code>, which is where all the electron build configs will go.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>"build"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    </span><span>"appId"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"your.id"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>"mac"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      </span><span>"category"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"public.app-category.video"</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>"directories"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>"output"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"packages"</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    </span><span>"files"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      </span><span>"package.json"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      </span><span>"dist/**"</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div><p>While this is a very basic starting point, there is a lot more to add here to actually get the build working. There are tons of good tutorials on this, but I’ll still go over it here briefly for posterity.</p><p>For each operating system you want to build to, you must choose your targets. For example, for Linux we want a build target as <code>.deb</code>, for debain operation systems.

Everything worked perfectly until i tried to query the networks available. I saw that the wireless connection was turned off. I went through the usual exercise of checking the drivers, then the antenna and checking if the card was seated right in the PCI-E slot. The card would never turn on. Since it was a re-branded Broadcom chipset i tried installing the Broadcom drivers as well as the dell drivers, no dice. Then i started reading up on the Mini PCI-E specifications for the WiFi card.</p><p>Older generation of WiFi mini PCI-E cards from a while ago usually have a hardware kill switch. This RF kill switch was usually connected to one of the pins on the Mini PCI-E header. Modern laptops are unable to turn on the WLAN card. Modern laptops can read and initialize the PCI-E card, but the radio part of the card is turned off.&nbsp;</p><p>From reading up on the spec sheet of several WLAN Mini-PCIE card from 7 years ago i found that that Mini-PCIE pin 20 which according to the specs was reserved for vendor specific purposes was being utilized as a RF kill switch.Similarly in cards with WiFi and Bluetooth, pin 51 is set for Bluetooth disable along with the pin 20 for WLAN disable.</p><figure><img width="658" height="273" src="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=658%2C273&amp;ssl=1" alt="Mini PCI Express" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/gsid.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mini_PCI_express.jpg?resize=658%2C273&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Mini PCI Express</figcaption></figure><p> Now i have to identify the pins in my Mini PCI-E card.

				<div itemprop="articleBody">
					<p><strong>Man in the Middle</strong> attack (MITM) is an extremely dangerous hacking and can happen anywhere. This can occur whether on a website, mobile phone, or in conventional communication tool such as correspondence. Therefore, it’s important to discuss MITM attack regardless of anything and wherever its technical implementation.</p>
<h2>What is Man in the Middle Attack?</h2>
<p>Man In The Middle attack is a hacking technique where hackers put themselves in the middle of two devices that communicate with each other. As in this type of hacking an attacker is overtaking in the middle of a communication, the attacker can read, hear, modify, or block the communication packet that is going to be sent or received in both devices.</p>
<p>The most severe outcome of a Man in the Middle attack hacking technique is that the hacker is wiretapping the information and steal passwords. This kind of attack is really effective, more dangerous and harder to avoid that <a href="https://skillonpage.com/what-is-phishing-scam-and-how-to-avoid-it/">how to avoid phishing</a>.</p>
<h2>MITM Isn’t Just Sniffing</h2>
<p>Perhaps, many people think that the aim of a Man in the Middle attack is to do wiretapping into a confidential <a href="https://skillonpage.com/data-communication-definition-and-types/">data communication</a> like a sniffing practice. Sniffing is a passive attack as the sniffing attacker doesn’t do anything, but monitor the passing data. Definitely, an attacker would be able to wiretap a communication between two parties using “Man in the Middle Attack” technique. But actually, the greatest strength of the MITM attack is not its sniffing ability. The MITM main ability is to intercept and alter the communication. So, the Man in the Middle Attack is also called as an active attack.</p>
<h2>How MITM Works</h2>
<p>MITM works by exploiting <strong>ARP</strong> (<em>Address Resolution Protocol</em>). ARP is a protocol that is in charge of translating the IP address to the MAC Address.</p>
<p>Basically, the lowest communication network is using a Mac Address as an identity between two devices. So, if an ARP table is modified by hackers, they can manipulate the data transmission for wrong purposes.</p>
<p>If you are using Windows computer, you can check the ARP table by typing “arp – a” in your command prompt (cmd). There you can find an IP address record line and Mac Address of all connected computers.</p>
<p>Let’s late a look at the picture below to consider the difference between data delivery routes before a MITM attack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="MITM" src="https://skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/before-mitm-attack.jpg" alt="Before MITM attack" width="594" height="386" srcset="https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/before-mitm-attack.jpg 594w, https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/before-mitm-attack-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px"></p>
<p>The client device will send and receive data directly from the wifi router without an intermediary when in an under normal condition. The normal condition here means before MITM attack. But after the MITM attacks the client device, the hacker is wiretapping the communication where the router works as you can see in the picture below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Man in the Middle Attack" src="https://skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/man-in-the-middle-attack.jpg" alt="After atarget get hacked using MITM technique" width="594" height="386" srcset="https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/man-in-the-middle-attack.jpg 594w, https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/man-in-the-middle-attack-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px"></p>
<p>Hackers can wiretap a communication as an ARP has two exploitable weaknesses, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every ARP Request or ARP Response is always Trusted;</li>
<li>Clients may receive a response even if they don’t send a request.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every device that freshly connects to a network always tries to find which one is the right router. Then the router will respond. Along with that, the router records the IP and Mac Address in the ARP Table.</p>
<p>To create a Man In The Middle condition, the hacker can send a response to a client computer by taking over as the router “if the client computer doesn’t verify” whether or not a connecting router is the right one. To illustrate this scheme, take a look at the following illustration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Hacker Decepts Client" src="https://skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hacker-decepts-client.jpg" alt="The illustration how a hacker decepts a client in MITM" width="594" height="386" srcset="https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hacker-decepts-client.jpg 594w, https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hacker-decepts-client-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px"></p>
<p>For every request and response is always trusted, the client device will believe that the right router is that hacker device. Over here, the hacker also managed to deceive the client device in wiretapping as a router. Next, the hacker will also masquerades as the right client to the router as explained at the picture below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Hacker Decepts Router" src="https://skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hacker-decepts-router.jpg" alt="The illustration how a hacker decepts a router" width="594" height="386" srcset="https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hacker-decepts-router.jpg 594w, https://www.skillonpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hacker-decepts-router-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px"></p>
<p>The router will originally deem that the hacker is the client and the client deems that the hacker is the router. That way, the hacker device is in the middle between the client and router. Every requested and received package done by the client device will be passing through the hacker’s device first. This is why such wiretapping is called as Man in the Middle attack.</p>
<h2>Tools That are Used by Hackers to Do MITM Attack</h2>
<p>Hackers require a Kali Linux operating system to do a MITM attack. They are also able to use Kali Linux on Windows using a virtual box or one of the best Kali Linux emulators for Windows.</p>
<p>One of the most popular MITM tools is <strong>MITMf</strong> (Man in the Middle Framework), which is a complete one with features for wiretapping. But when a hacker wants to practice a MITM attack, must first be in the same network with the target victim.</p>
<p>The following is the hacking command in MITMf:</p>
<p><em>mitmf -arp -spoof -gateway [target router ip] -targets [ target client ip]</em></p>
<p>That command will deceive both target router and client at once. Then the hacker enables an IP forward by editing file/proc/sys/net/ipv4 /ip_forward which initially 0 (inactive) becomes 1 (active). This is done so that packets which are not addressed to the hacker’s device can be forwarded to the target client’s device.</p>
<p>When the hacker runs MITMf, it will automatically perform an attack as described above (deceive the client and its router) as well as running sniffing packet. A bugged package will be listed directly in the terminal.</p>
<p>All sensitive information such as username and password will be visible in a bare text (without encryption) if the accessed site does not use SSL (https).</p>
<p>For example, in a Google Chrome browser, the victim is accessing a login page on a membership site and fills his credentials to the login form. Because the site doesn’t use https, the username and password will be sent without encryption. Then, the package containing that username and password is going through the hacker’s tool first and can be read on the hacker’s device.</p>
<p>Most large websites use SSL for security. The main function of SSL is to encrypt all data so it cannot be tapped. Remarkably, MITMf runs an SSLstrip program automatically. SSLstrip is a program that can downgrade https to http. Even so, large sites like Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. use another security that forces their users to keep using https.</p>
<p>But what happens when a target uses a “remember me” feature?. Using the “remember me” feature allows us to automatically log in using cookies on the browser. Such condition, the password and username are not sent to the server so Hackers cannot read the password.</p>
<p>Login using cookies on browsers is still dangerous as it still can be stolen. Instead of tapping passwords, hackers can also steal cookies and then use them on their browsers. This way, hackers can log in without knowing the targets’ username and password. Stealing cookies is more practical in wiretapping.</p>
<p>So, hackers need&nbsp; MITMf for Man in the Middle, Farred for stealing cookies, and Hamsters for injecting cookies to Linux Kali’s browser. Hacking techniques vary as there are many hacking tools with similar functions.</p>
<p>However, here we are not giving a deeper tutorial on how to hack using MITM. But at least knowing how such tools work would be useful for you to avoid hacking attacks.</p>
<h2>The Bad Things Caused by Man in the Middle Attack</h2>
<p>Given that in a Man in the Middle attack a hacker is wiretapping a communication path, the sent or received information can be changed, removed, or faked. Hackers can do such bad things by using a Man in the Middle techniques.</p>
<h3>Wiretapping</h3>
<p>Whatever you write on blogs or other <a href="https://skillonpage.com/types-of-websites/">types of websites</a>, including super sensitive information like “password”, will be passing through hacker’s tool first. So, the hacker can peep your password and other credentials. MITM can also integrate with the Wireshark. This integration is useful for hackers in doing wiretapping activities as through Wireshark hackers can better record and display the stolen data.</p>
<h3>JavaScript Injection</h3>
<p>This is the most dangerous thing in MITM attack. JavaScript injection makes a MITM attack become infinite as long as hackers are good JavaScript skills. The MITMf tool supports practical plugins for javascript. For example, hackers can capture the victims’ browser screenshot with repetitive frequencies that can be determined. Besides, Javascript also helps hackers to remotely enable <a href="https://skillonpage.com/check-if-keylogger-runs-on-computer/">keylogger</a>, webcam, fake pop-up login form on victims’ browser and so forth. Hackers can also integrate Man in the Middle attack with a BEef program. The BEbeef program can help hackers to totally hack the victims’ browser by way of a Javascript provided by BEef is executed in the victims’ browser.</p>
<h3><a href="https://skillonpage.com/how-dns-works/">DNS</a> Deception</h3>
<p>Every time you type a website address, actually you are going to access to a web server in the form of IP address. So, hackers can apply a fake DNS using the Man in the Middle technique. For example, when you type Google, the opened site is a fake Google. Even that you are pretty sure you are typing a correct address. By using a DNS spoofing, Hackers can change a site to an IP address such as to a local website that resides in a hacker’s computer.</p>
<h3>Cookie Theft</h3>
<p>Your browser stores your login data to cookies. It’s why can directly login to Facebook without filling your username and password when you simply type in facebook address. That’s one of the functions of cookies. The bad thing is that using a MITM technique, hackers can steal your cookies.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid MITM Attack</h2>
<p>You will not realize any Man in the Middle attack until you feel something really odd. Because there is no notification when you are being attacked. Unless when you see suddenly a from popping up on your browser to ask you to re-login which makes you suspicious. That’s an example of a javascript injection from MITM hackers.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you suspicious enough, immediately check the ARP table by typing <em>arp –</em>a at the command prompt (cmd). Make sure there are no two different IPs with the same network using same Mac Address.</p>
<p>Now you should be knowing how dangerous it is when you are on the same network with a hacker. Therefore, increase your internet security, always double checking site addresses that use https. When it turns automatically to http, you should have been suspicious. If …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently I've come to know the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> while watching a lecture of the course <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/">Intro to Database Systems</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> on database storage. One of the main problems a database storage engine has to solve is <strong>how to deal with data in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. At a higher level, the main purpose of a disk-oriented storage engine is to manipulate data files in a disk. But if we assume that the data in the disk will eventually get bigger than the available memory, we cannot simply load the whole data file into memory, do the change, and write it back to disk.</p><p>This is not a new problem in Computer Science. When operational systems were being developed in the early 1960s, a similar problem was faced: <strong>how can we run programs stored in disk that are larger than the available memory?</strong> A solution to this problem was made by a group in Manchester, implemented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(computer)">Atlas Computer</a>, in 1961. It was called <em>virtual memory</em>. The <em>virtual memory</em> gives a running program the illusion that it has big enough memory, despite the fact that the computer does not have enough.</p><p>We are not going to go deep on how <em>virtual memory</em> works. Just have in mind that when a program is accessing memory it is accessing the <em>virtual memory</em>. And maybe the data the program is trying to access is not actually in memory, but it does not matter. The operational system will make pretend that it is by going to disk, and putting it there, and replace an old chunk of memory that is not going to be used.</p><p>So, one of the ways a database storage engine can solve the larger than memory problem is to make use of <em>virtual memory</em> and the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong>.</p><p>In Linux, we can make this use by using the system call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> that lets you map a file, no matter how big, directly into memory. If your program needs to manipulate the file, all it needs is to manipulate the memory. The operating system handles the writes to disk for you.</p><p>In some occasions, programmers find this method more convenient than the usual system calls: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close</a>.</p><h3 id="a-simple-demonstration">A simple demonstration</h3><p>Here is a small example of how you can take advantage of this in Go using the package <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>:</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"os"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go"
)

func main() {
	f, _ := os.OpenFile("./file", os.O_RDWR, 0644)
	defer f.Close()
	
	mmap, _ := mmap.Map(f, mmap.RDWR, 0 )
	defer mmap.Unmap()
	fmt.Println(string(mmap))

	mmap.Flush()
}</code></pre><figure><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/pRS8PvTRHksnCVQgSOWvPBF3a.svg" alt="asciicast"></figure><p>The beauty is that we could have a much bigger file, and the solution would still work. We would not have to worry about managing memory in order to avoid it filling up.</p><h3 id="detailing-mmap-capabilites">Detailing <em>mmap</em> capabilites</h3><p>We're going to explore more <em>mmap</em> functionalities from the point of view of the API provided by <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>. There are probably more features that the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix#Mmap">native syscall</a> provides that this library does not implement.</p><h4 id="the-prot-argument">The <code>prot</code> argument</h4><p>Here is the <code>mmap.Map</code> signature</p><pre><code>func Map(f *os.File, prot, flags int) (MMap, error) 
</code></pre><p>Let's look at <code>prot</code> first. The <code>prot</code> argument lets you specify the protection levels of your mapping: <code>RDONLY</code>, <code>RDWR</code>, <code>EXEC</code> are the options provided for <code>mmap-go</code>. These levels are pretty straightforward, <code>RDONLY</code> means you can only read from the mapping, <code>RDWR</code> means you can also write, and <code>EXEC</code> means you can execute code on that mapping. &nbsp;Here is the description of <code>prot</code> from the Linux <code>man</code>:</p><pre><code>The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the
mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).
It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or more of the
following flags:

PROT_EXEC
    Pages may be executed.

PROT_READ
    Pages may be read.

PROT_WRITE
    Pages may be written.

PROT_NONE
    Pages may not be accessed.
</code></pre><p>In the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix">unix package</a>, those flags are: <code>unix.PROT_EXEC</code>, <code>unix.PROT_READ</code>, <code>unix.PROT_WRITE</code> and <code>unix.PROT_NONE</code>.</p><h4 id="experimenting-with-prot_exec-flag">Experimenting with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> flag</h4><p>I've become intrigued by the <code>EXEC</code> flag and wanted to see an example of how that works. I've Google and could not find any example. So I tried a search in Github by <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and found a good example in <code>C</code>: <a href="https://github.com/onesmash/MMapExecDemo">MMapExecDemo</a>. I replicated this example in <code>Go</code> using <code>mmap-go</code>.</p><p>The first step was to create a function that I wanted to be put in memory by <code>mmap</code> allocation, compile it, and get its assembly opcodes.</p><p>I created the <code>inc</code> function in <code>inc.go</code> file</p><pre><code>package inc

func inc(n int) int {
	return n + 1
}

</code></pre><p>compiled it with <code>go tool compile -S -N inc.go</code>, then got its assembly by calling <code>go tool objdump -S inc.o</code>.</p><pre><code>func inc(n int) int {
  0x22b                 48c744241000000000      MOVQ $0x0, 0x10(SP)
        return n + 1
  0x234                 488b442408              MOVQ 0x8(SP), AX
  0x239                 48ffc0                  INCQ AX
  0x23c                 4889442410              MOVQ AX, 0x10(SP)
  0x241                 c3                      RET
</code></pre><p>With this, we can build represent our function in bytes on our code</p><pre><code>code := []byte{
        0x48, 0xc7, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
		0x48, 0x8b, 0x44, 0x24, 0x08,
		0x48, 0xff, 0xc0,
		0x48, 0x89, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10,
		0xc3,
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate our memory with <code>mmap</code>.</p><pre><code>memory, err := mmap.MapRegion(nil, len(code), mmap.EXEC|mmap.RDWR, mmap.ANON, 0)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
</code></pre><p>In this call, we're using a more complete function called <code>MapRegion</code> that lets you specify how much memory you are allocating (<code>Map</code> allocates the size of the underlying file) and the offset of the file.</p><p>In the beginning, we said that the main purpose of <code>mmap</code> was to create a mapping between a file and memory. But in this call we are not indicating any file. <code>mmap</code> can be used just a regular memory allocater by setting <code>nil</code> to the <code>*os.File</code> argument and <code>mmap.ANON</code> to the <code>flags</code> argument. We will talk about more <code>mmap.ANON</code>. Since we are not mapping any file, the offset is <code>0</code>.</p><p>So we have memory allocated with the same size of our code <code>len(code)</code>. Since we set the flag <code>mmap.RDWR</code>, we can copy our <code>code</code> to <code>memory</code>.</p><pre><code>copy(memory, code)
</code></pre><p>We have the code of our <code>inc</code> function in memory. In order to execute it, we have to cast that memory address to a function with a signature that matches the signature of our compiled <code>inc</code>.</p><pre><code>memory_ptr := &amp;memory
ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&amp;memory_ptr)
inc := *(*func(int) int)(ptr)
</code></pre><p>When we call <code>inc</code>, we are executing the code we put in memory. That only works because of the flag <code>mmap.EXEC</code>. If that flag was not set, a <code>segmentation violation</code> would occur.</p><pre><code>fmt.Println(inc(10)) // Prints 11
</code></pre><p>I don't know if this is a real use case. I just wanted to see what it meant to execute code that you put in memory. And there are probably other ways of achieving the same with regular memory allocation and calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a>.</p><p>One question that may come up is: but the code is already in the <code>code</code> variable, can't we just execute it? No, because the memory static allocated to <code>code</code> is not executable. Can we make it executable? I've tried to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a> on it but still got <code>segmentation violation</code>.</p><p>Here is the full working <a href="https://gist.github.com/brunoac/b9ff4ad46c27926e5e4f078133d0de79">gist</a>.</p><h4 id="the-flags-argument">The <code>flags</code> argument</h4><p>We can have many processes mapping the same memory region. This argument lets us decide about the visibility of the updates happening in the mapping. There are many flags, and you can check them out at <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>. The important ones are <code>unix.MAP_SHARED</code>, <code>unix.MAP_PRIVATE</code> and <code>unix.MAP_ANON</code>.</p><p><code>MAP_SHARED</code> means that changes to the mapping are visible to all processes and will also occur at the underlying mapped file, although we cannot control when.</p><p><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> means the changes are private and other processes will not see them. And also, they are not carried through to the underlying file.</p><p><code>MAP_ANON</code> means that there is not going to be a mapped file. It is useful for sub-processes communication with shared memory.</p><p>I've got confused about the <code>mmap-go</code> library implementation. It only provides the <code>mmap.ANON</code> flag, that we used in the above example. If you want your mapping to be private, you can set the <code>mmap.COPY</code> flag to the <code>prot</code> argument. Anyways, you can always use the flags provided by the <code>unix</code> package implementation.</p><h4 id="locking-and-flushing">Locking and flushing</h4><p>Two other nice methods, <code>Lock</code> and <code>Flush</code>, are provided by the API of <code>mmap-go</code>. The <code>Lock</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a> system call that prevents the mapping to be paged out to disk. And the <code>Flush</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msync.2.html">msync</a> system call that forces the data in memory to be written to disk. This is a good way to trying to have more control over how and when data is flushed to disk.</p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3><p>I felt kind of stupid of knowing about <code>mmap</code> after so long. I don't remember it being brought in my college class. For some reason, I felt amazed by it and its capabilities and decided to dig deeper. I like databases and I'm aiming to get a better grasp of them. This means that <code>mmap</code> cannot go unnoticed from my learning. For future posts, I'll try to bring about the benefits and drawbacks of using <code>mmap</code>, which projects use it, and what kind of problems it is suited for.</p><p>Even though the <code>mmap</code> can be used to solve that database problem we stated in the beginning, and many modern databases use it, <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> advocates against it and have three lecture on how to databases, that don't use <code>mmap</code>, manage data.</p><p>If you like this kind of content, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/brunocalza">twitter</a>.

									<p>With COVID-19 forcing many of us indoors and cooking more (yes, this post took a little longer to go live than I planned), there’s never been a better time to really learn how to cook. I grew up not learning much about how to cook and taught myself as an adult. Over the last 5-7 years I went from someone who could do the absolute bare minimum (boil pasta, cook chicken breast, etc) to genuinely quite a decent cook. I can easily whip up dinner for 4-6 friends without stressing, cook healthy dinners at home most nights of the week, run a barbecue for 12 people, and have a small quiver of fancy dishes to impress friends, family, and my wife from time to time. This post is mostly about what works for me, but I’m calling it Cooking For Founders because I think it will resonate with a lot of entrepreneurs who think like me.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is not to teach you how to cook but to provide fairly comprehensive, but also minimum viable, roadmap for going from a cooking noob to solid home chef.</p>
<h2>Why you should cook</h2>
<p>Until I was about 25 or so I really didn’t cook much. I lived in places like NYC and London where restaurants were always open and ubiquitous and especially in these cities, it’s a perfectly reasonable position to just not bother learning to cook well. But I want to make the case that even if you have world class restaurants and food delivery services on demand, you should learn to cook.</p>
<p><strong>Social: </strong>Home cooked meals are an awesome offer that people are very likely to take you up on and really appreciate. Cooking well is sexy and makes for an awesome date night. Dinner parties are fantastic well to meet new people and create a vibrant personal and professional network. Taking charge of a meal is a great way to bring your family together or impress your in-laws.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Health: </strong>Even if you aren’t bothering with any particular diet (low carb, paleo, etc), cooking at home is almost always going to be more nutritious than food from restaurants. Getting actually healthy food from restaurants/delivery is almost always expensive. Cooking at home is an affordable way to get great nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Health:&nbsp;</strong>This may be more specific to me, but I find cooking to be fantastic for my mental health. In my house I’m the one cooking about 90% of the time and I’m not into the mega meal prep strategies where you cook food for the whole week. So, most days, I’m cooking something fresh for dinner. The need to start cooking prep in time for a reasonable dinner puts a natural stopping point in my work day and then I get to switch to a very focused mono-tasking activity. This routine is, for me, a kind of meditation that separates the work day and let’s my brain process the events of the day.</p>
<h2>Meta-learning Tips for Learning to Cook</h2>
<p>Learning to cook is not exactly easy. There is an infinite amount of recipes, techniques, resources, diets, and on and on to consume. It can be overwhelming. Learning to cook is almost always laden with failures along the way. You’ll screw up some recipes, ruin some dishes, and get halfway through a complex recipe before realizing you’re missing some essential ingredient. Here are some lessons I’ve learned on how to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Find your YouTube &amp; TikTok muses</strong></p>
<p>There is an infinite amount of cooking content on the internet, but when you find a particular chef or channel that really speaks your language, subscribe and binge their entire backlog. Lots of channels out there will skip essential explanations, use overly exotic ingredients, or complex unnecessary techniques so when you find one that consistently speaks to you, lock it in. Some ones I like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/helenrennie" data-lasso-id="385">Helen Rennie (YouTube)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes" data-lasso-id="386">Food Wishes (YouTube)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SeriousEats" data-lasso-id="387">Serious Eats (YouTube)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatdudecancook?lang=en" data-lasso-id="388">@thatdudecancook (TikTok)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sad_papi?lang=en" data-lasso-id="389">@sad_papi (TikTok)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Have a backup plan</strong></p>
<p>Learning to cook and feeding yourself can be two different things, especially when you are first starting out and failure rates are high. If you are going to try a new recipe for the first time on a busy week night that’s supposed to be your dinner that night (1) go for it! (2) have a frozen pizza or some other quick and easy back up plan ready in case you end up ruining the dish. It’s a really negative feedback loop to mess up a recipe and having to end up eating cereal for dinner, so have a backup plan.</p>
<p><strong>Read/watch the recipe several times well before cooking</strong></p>
<p>Read or watch your recipes <em>carefully,&nbsp;</em>several times, in preparation for trying a new recipe. It’s easy to miss, especially at first, that the recipe actually requires marinating over night, or needs buttermilk or some other ingredient you don’t typically have on hand. Don’t just plop open the recipe book at 7p and start with Step #1.</p>
<p><strong>Stick to a few core cookbooks</strong></p>
<p>Again, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the millions of cookbooks out there. Like YouTube channels, I recommend finding a few comprehensive cookbooks that work for you and sticking to them for years until you get very confident with a wide variety of techniques. With cookbooks, Kindle will work but having the physical copy can also be really helpful (or honestly I usually get both). Here are some that I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cook-Everything_Completely-Revised-Twentieth-Anniversary/dp/1328545431?tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="390" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-lasso-name="How to Cook Everything">How To Cook Everything, Mark Bittman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Geeks-Science-Great-Cooks/dp/1491928050?tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="391" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-lasso-name="Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Cooks, and Good Food">Cooking For Geeks, Jeff Potter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830?tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="392">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, Samin Nosrat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Chef-Cooking-Learning-Anything/dp/1328519163?tag=tyletrin-20" data-lasso-id="393">The Four Hour Chef, Tim Ferriss</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Essential Concepts</h2>
<p>The books and channels above all have great introductions to all of these concepts so I’m not going to try to actually cover them here, but I think it’s useful have a few simple concepts to check off as you read/watch through the first few.</p>
<p><strong>What heat does (chemistry)</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you pay attention to the sections on the basic chemistry of heat. The vast majority of cooking is just different ways applying heat to food and it’s critical to understand what heat is doing to different kinds of foods. For the most part heat is either (1) denaturing proteins or (2) producing a Maillard Reaction. Denaturing proteins is the slow gradual cooking process that turns eggs from runny to scrambled or steak from rare to well done. Different foods have different kinds of proteins which denature at different temperatures and in different ways. The Maillard Reaction is browning (mostly on on meats and vegetables) and happens at very high heat and low moisture environments. Read up on these carefully. Cooking for Geeks covers these the best in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Different kinds of heat transfer (physics)</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to understanding what heat does, it’s really important to have a basic grasp of the various methods of applying heat to food. Baking, broiling, roasting, sautéing, braising, searing, sous vide, boiling, and so on, are all just different methods for applying heat. Some, like baking, use convection where the air is heated up around the food, and others, like searing in a pan, use conduction where the heat is transferred directly surface to surface. A cast iron pan takes a very long time to heat up and stays hot for a long time, whereas the air in your oven can dissipate its heat quickly. Understanding these basic concepts will give you the architecture for understanding for why you should keep the oven door closed as much as possible, dry your meat before searing, and pre-heat your heavy pans for longer than your light ones.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong></p>
<p>When you are first learning to cook I recommend avoiding complex recipes in favor of simple two or three-part meals where each component is cooked individually. The vast majority of our home-cooked meals involve cooking (a) a protein like fish or meat (b) a vegetable cooked simply, like roasted in olive oil and (c) a starch like rice, potatoes, simple pasta. This let’s you build a healthy meal with simple individual components, master the same techniques with repeat practice, and minimize the risk of blowing up the whole dish.</p>
<p><strong>Make it taste good</strong></p>
<p>This may seem obvious, but it’s important that the food you cook actually taste good. Home-cooked food is almost always healthier than restaurant food, so don’t try to learn to cook and cook the healthiest possible version of each dish. Most veggies taste better roasted in a generous amount of olive oil than they do steamed, so roast them! Baste your chicken in butter. Salt your food generously. Learning to cook by producing dishes that just aren’t that tasty is a very bad feedback loop, so do what you need to to make it taste good.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t cook everything evenly</strong></p>
<p>This is a little more specific but I feel like it needs to be specifically counter-programmed. For some dumb reason a lot people (including myself 10 years ago) got the notion that food needs to be cooked&nbsp;<em>evenly</em>. That it’s really important to constantly turn and shake and rotate your food so that it’s cooked the same all the around and through. This is a great way to make gross food. Stop touching and turning your food. Most dishes are better with a substantial amount of difference in how cooked different sides of the food are: steak with a crunchy sear and medium rare inside, roasted potatoes with a waxy crust and fluffy inside, carrots or asparagus charred on side are all much tastier and mostly produced by having uneven cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Baking is really hard</strong></p>
<p>Really. Baking is much harder and less forgiving than any other kind of cooking. If you’re just starting to get into cooking, don’t start with baking.</p>
<h2>Essential Gear</h2>
<p>Okay, obviously you can spend and absolute fortune and fill a kitchen with mountains of cooking gear. That’s part of the fun of getting into cooking, let’s be honest. But if all you’ve got is a crappy 10-piece Wal-mart cooking set you got as a wedding gift or a hodge podge you inherited from your roommates, and you need to build your kitchen from scratch, this is the minimum kit I think you need. <em>(Disclosure: most of these are Amazon affiliates links. Don’t click them if that’s a thing that will make you mad).</em></p>
<p><strong>Pots and Pans</strong></p>
<p>The essential workhorses of cooking. Different kinds of pots and pans provide really different value for money, so I’ll specifically recommend below which ones I think it makes sense to invest in something …</p></div></div>

<div>
  
  <p><span>Jan 2021</span></p>
  <p>I started a new job recently so I had the opportunity to get one of the new M1 MacBooks, I decided to go with the Air. The reviews have been very positive and I’m here to tell you: it is indeed an amazing device. The performance feels a lot better than my MacBook Pro 16”, which is only a year old and about 3x the price.</p>

<p>When I got the Mac I set out with the goal of avoiding Intel builds of software as much as possible and using native whenever possible unless it’s absolutely impossible.</p>

<h2 id="nix">Nix</h2>

<p>I have my <a href="https://github.com/bouk/b" target="_blank">whole system configuration</a> stored in <a href="https://bou.ke/blog/nix/">Nix</a>, which was the thing that I least expected to work and arm64 support is still a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/95903" target="_blank">work in progress</a>. I could install the <code>x86_64</code> build of Nix and run it under Rosetta but wanted to avoid that, so I went back to my old pal;</p>

<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>

<p>This was one of the first things I installed and got working, when I did it I had to install it into <code>/opt/homebrew</code> manually and install everything with the <code>--source</code> flag but… everything mostly worked? Lots of props to the Homebrew team for getting everything running so quickly, with some amazing <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank">open-source project management</a> the community worked together very quickly to support most of the software that Homebrew offers. There’s still some software that doesn’t work—notably neovim. But I’m sure that will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>The installer now installs into <code>/opt/homebrew</code> by default and there’s prebuilt bottles of most packages, so the Homebrew experience is great.</p>

<h2 id="go">Go</h2>

<p>A lot of my work involves Go, and I depend on a lot of tools written in Go. I was happy to see that the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/ports" target="_blank">Go team was on top of it</a> and released the 1.16 beta quite quickly, which is what is installed right now when you do <code>brew install go</code>. I’ve had no issues with it and am enjoying some of the new features like <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41191" target="_blank">file embedding</a>. GoLand was also <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2020/12/30/goland-2020-3-1-is-out/" target="_blank">updated</a> to support M1 pretty quickly.</p>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>Terraform I had the most issues with since using it depends on a bunch of plugins, which are generally only available for x86_64. This won’t change until Go 1.16 has been released. So here I had to resort to building for x86_64, which is easy to do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl -L 'https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/archive/v0.14.4.tar.gz' | tar -xzf-
cd terraform-0.14.4/
GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ~/bin/terraform
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now Terraform will just use plugin built for Intel. I assume that most Terraform plugins will support arm64 very quickly after Go 1.16 is out.</p>

<h2 id="rust-and-universal-binaries">Rust and Universal Binaries</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a> as my terminal. It supported <code>arm64</code> pretty quickly but the current build for it doesn’t include it, so I <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/4683" target="_blank">made a PR</a> that will build a universal binary. Creating a universal binary for Rust is quite easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo build <span>--release</span> <span>--target</span><span>=</span>x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build <span>--release</span> <span>--target</span><span>=</span>aarch64-apple-darwin
lipo target/<span>{</span>x86_64,aarch64<span>}</span><span>-apple-darwin</span>/release/alacritty <span>-create</span> <span>-output</span> alacritty
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running <code>file alacritty</code> will now show you something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alacritty: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64]
alacritty (for architecture x86_64):    Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
alacritty (for architecture arm64):     Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you can run it in either <code>x86_64</code> mode with <code>arch -x86_64 alacritty</code> or natively with <code>arch -arm64 alacritty</code> and the OS will automatically select the right binary.</p>

<p>Building a universal binary for a Go application is similarly easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app_amd64 main.go
GOARCH=arm64 go build -o app_arm64 main.go
lipo app_{amd64,arm64} -create -output app
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="windows-and-games">Windows and Games</h2>

<p>There’s a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology" target="_blank">games</a> I’ve been playing for a long time that I still need on any computer I get, but they’re 32-bit Windows-only. This was something that was surprisingly easy to get working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/" target="_blank">Parallels Technical Preview</a></li>
  <li>Sign up for Windows Insider and download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64" target="_blank">Windows 10 on ARM Insider Preview</a></li>
  <li>Install it into Parallels</li>
  <li>Done</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can download Steam and basically install anything and it will probably work. Microsoft really did some amazing magic in getting both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 programs running on <code>arm64</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bou.ke/images/windows-solitaire.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Somehow Apple has created the best PC in every category at once. It is even the best Windows PC, despite the multiple layers of emulation that are happening. The battery life is incredible, I haven’t experienced any slowdowns, I don’t hear any fans spin up (because there are none). It’s hard not to be excited about this.</p>

<p>If Apple chose to go down this path, they could dominate the server space if they took their magic chips, put it in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit" target="_blank">rack unit</a> and made it easy to install Linux onto it. Intel is completely screwed unless they come up with something better, fast.</p>

better reflect the voters' opinions.
This article partially answers the
question: <strong>how to fairly gather the preferences
of a group of voters to select a winner?</strong></p><p>No information from this post is new.
Most of the content is heavily
inspired from the following sources:</p><ul><li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system">Wikipedia article on electoral systems</a>,</li><li>the <a href="http://dss.in.tum.de/files/brandt-research/voting_slides.pdf">presentation of Practical Voting Rules</a>

(yes, it is in French) by Science4All,</li></ul><p>This blog post is a simple introduction to ranked voting systems and a presentation of a few voting methods:</p><p>Discover<br>ranked 🥇🥈🥉<br>election systems</p><h2><p><a href="#the-problem-space"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>The problem space</p></h2><figure><div><p><img alt="xkcd voting referendum (https://xkcd.com/2225/)" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/2225/">xkcd: Voting Referendum</a></figcaption></figure><p>In real-world elections, we are generally unable to express our entire preference order. Most of the time, we are
only able to select one single candidate with our ballot. This leads us to lie about our preferences,
for example when a vote would be <em>“wasted”</em> on an underdog (this is the spoiler effect).
Elections could be fairer if voters would be able to indicate their full preference order!
It could then be taken into account and better reflect people's opinions.
Also, entering all preferences in one ballot allows us to compute elections of multiple rounds at once,
without having to force the voters to cast multiple ballots for the same election.</p><p>There are 2 main ways to record voters' opinion:</p><ul><li><p><strong>ranked voting</strong>: each voter can submit an order of preference between the candidates</p></li><li><p><strong>cardinal voting</strong>: each voter grades the candidates on a scale. For example rating all candidates
between 0 and 5.</p></li></ul><figure>Number the boxes in order of your choice<ul><li><span><span>4</span></span> <!-- -->Hayden Kelly</li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span> <!-- -->Lesley Poole</li><li><span><span>4</span></span> <!-- -->Marley Bennett</li><li><span><span>3</span></span> <!-- -->Lesley Mills</li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span> <!-- -->Erin Fraser</li><li><span><span>1</span></span> <!-- -->Brett Nielsen</li><li><span><span>4</span></span> <!-- -->Noel Curry</li><li><span><span>2</span></span> <!-- -->Vic Levy</li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span> <!-- -->Tanner Fleming</li><li><span><span>2</span></span> <!-- -->Glen Hoffman</li></ul><figcaption>Example of a ranked ballot. The preferred candidate of this voter is Brett Nielsen</figcaption></figure><p>Even though cardinal voting has many supporters,
I dislike it for enabling voters to vote tactically: one can benefit from lying.
For example, by only giving extreme grades, a voter can have more impact than
others. Therefore this article will only focus on <strong>ranked voting</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>Voters can rank alternatives in a sequence, possibly with ties. Ballots contain ranked (not rated!) candidates.
The ballots accept ties: if voters are indifferent between two candidates, they can put them in
the same rank in their ballots.</p></li><li><p>The goal of the vote is to compute a hierarchy among the alternatives along with a winner.
This means the vote can select options like a restaurant for the evening, a president<!-- -->…<!-- -->
Proportional representation, like electing a parliament, is not a subject of this article.</p></li><li><p>For the sake of simplicity, ties and tie-breakers are ignored in this article. The
examples were chosen not to result in tied situations.</p></li></ul><h2><p><a href="#5-simple-voting-systems"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>5 simple voting systems</p></h2><p>Let<!-- -->'<!-- -->s consider an election in the animal world
(copying CGP Grey's videos) with a
particular voting scenario invented by Michel Balinski,
a mathematician, economist and political scientist.</p><p>This is a virtual election with <strong>100 voters</strong> and <strong>5
candidates</strong>: <span><span><span>🐸</span> <!-- -->Frog</span></span>, <span><span><span>🐷</span> <!-- -->Pig</span></span>, <span><span><span>🦁</span> <!-- -->Lion</span></span>, <span><span><span>🐻</span> <!-- -->Bear</span></span> and <span><span><span>🐭</span> <!-- -->Mouse</span></span></p><p>The voters can be gathered in 6 groups, each having the same preference order.
The preferences of all the voters are represented in this array
(which must be read as <em>“33 voters (first column) rank Frog first, then Pig,
then Lion, then Bear and finally Mouse is their least favourite;
16 voters (second column) rank Pig first, then Bear, then Lion; etc.”</em>):</p><p>We can compare some voting systems using this preference profile as an input.</p><h3><p><a href="#first-past-the-post"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>First past the post</p></h3><p>Probably the most basic voting method. Only the first choice of each voter matters
and we simply count the votes.
It is used in elections in many countries (the USA, the UK, Canada...).</p><p>With the voting system <strong>first past the post</strong>: Frog gets
33 votes, which is better than any other candidates. <span><span><span>🐸</span> <!-- -->Frog</span></span> wins.</p><p>This result can feel unfair because voters'
preferences are hardly taken into account. Frog won because it is ranked first by the biggest
group (33%), but it is also ranked last by the majority of voters (56%)!
That 56% (who ranked Frog last) could potentially come together before the start of the vote and agree on their
preferred candidate — which would be Mouse — to prevent Frog from being elected.</p><h3><p><a href="#contingent-vote-two-round-run-off"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>Contingent vote / Two-round run-off</p></h3><p>With these methods,
if no candidate receives 50% of the votes in the first round,
a second round of voting is held with only the top two candidates.</p><p>The Contingent vote lets voters cast their preference order at once and the winner can be computed
without needing another vote.</p><p>In two-round run-off elections, voters are only asked about their preferred candidate. They
have to vote again in the second round.
47 countries (Finland, France, Russia, Turkey...) use this system for their presidential elections.</p><p>A candidate
ranked last by more than 50%
of the voters cannot be elected by these methods.</p><p>With the voting system <strong>two-round run-off</strong>:
Frog and Mouse compete in the second round
and <span><span><span>🐭</span> <!-- -->Mouse</span></span> wins with 64% of the votes.</p><p>But Mouse is still the second most disliked candidate:
if we remove the most disliked candidate (Frog),
we are left with 52% of the voters ranking Mouse last!
Those voters can understandably be unsatisfied and ask
for a different system to be used.</p><h3><p><a href="#instant-run-off"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>Instant Run-off</p></h3><p>Counting only the first choices of the voters,
the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.
The election repeats until there is a winner.
It is used for example to elect members of the Australian House of Representatives,
the president of India and the president of Ireland.</p><p>Lion is eliminated first, then Pig, then Mouse,
then Frog. The final winner of the instant run-off vote is <span><span><span>🐻</span> <!-- -->Bear</span></span>.</p><p>Knowing the outcome of that vote, some groups could have
changed their ballots to prevent Bear's election. For
example, the 33%-group could decide to rank Pig first, and provoke
the election of Pig instead of Bear!</p><p>Coombs' rule is a similar voting method where the candidate ranked last by most voters gets eliminated
each round.
This rule would elect Pig.</p><h3></h3><p>For each voter, every candidate is given points
corresponding to their rank in the voter's preferences.
In our case: the first position gets 5 points, the second position gets
4 points<!-- -->…<!-- -->
It is currently used to elect members of the Parliament of Nauru
and two ethnic minority members of the National Assembly of Slovenia.</p><p>With <strong>Borda<!-- -->'<!-- -->s rule</strong>: <span><span><span>🐷</span> <!-- -->Pig</span></span> wins
with 347 points, and Lion is second with 344 points.</p><p>If the voters knew that the race would be so close between Pig and Lion,
they probably would have tried to influence the election by ranking them
as the first or the last in their ballots. Since 51% of the voters prefer Lion to Pig,
they can change the outcome of the election.
This kind of phenomenon often leads political systems to be bipartisan.</p><h3><p><a href="#copelands-method"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>Copeland's method</p></h3><p>Finally, someone found the perfect voting system for this election!
Copeland's method considers all duels between the candidates and
counts the number of victories, similarly to a tournament.</p><p>(Click on the array cells to show the duels)</p><p>Wins count:<br><span><span><span>🐸</span> Frog: 0</span></span> <span><span><span>🐷</span> Pig: 3</span></span> <span><span><span>🦁</span> Lion: 4</span></span> <span><span><span>🐻</span> Bear: 2</span></span> <span><span><span>🐭</span> Mouse: 1</span></span></p><p>Using <strong>Copeland<!-- -->'<!-- -->s method</strong>: <span><span><span>🦁</span> <!-- -->Lion</span></span> wins.
In fact, Lion wins all the duels, this is called a <em><strong>Condorcet winner</strong></em>.
Interestingly, this candidate was never selected as a winner
by the other real-world voting methods even though it wins all duels!
The voters of this election are finally happy thanks to Copeland<!-- -->'<!-- -->s method:
the winner of all duels wins the election, everything is perfectly logical.</p><p><strong>Did you notice? The 5 voting systems gave 5 different winners while the electors
did not change their preferences! <span>🤯</span></strong></p><h2><p><a href="#condorcet"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>Just pick the candidate winning all duels?! — Condorcet winners and Condorcet paradox</p></h2><h3><p><a href="#preference-graphs"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>Preferences graph helps to visualize duels</p></h3><p>To visualize the duels, it is helpful to simplify the representation of the input by

We can still combine opposed edges, which makes it way more readable:</p><p><span><span><span>🦁</span> <!-- -->Lion</span></span>, with all edges going outwards, is the <strong>Condorcet winner</strong> (winner of all duels).</p><h3><p><a href="#condorcet-paradox"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>Condorcet paradox</p></h3><p>After seeing Copeland<!-- -->'<!-- -->s method, you may think
<em>“Just pick the candidate that wins all duels!”</em>.
It would be great if this was always possible, but unfortunately,
there are situations where no candidate wins all duels and
a cycle appears.</p><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>“<strong>Transitive</strong> preference order” means: if I prefer <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> and <em>b</em> to <em>c</em>, then I also prefer <em>a</em> to <em>c</em>.</p></figure><p>Using a ranked voting method, each voter submits a ballot with
a transitive preference of the candidates.

why can<!-- -->'<!-- -->t voting systems simply agree on a winner?
Why is it so hard to aggregate voters<!-- -->'<!-- --> preference orders?
Can<!-- -->'<!-- -->t Copeland's method always be used?</p><p>With 3 candidates or more, problems may start to arise since
some collective preferences can be cyclic. Here is an example
of a vote for the best food. 15 voters
are deciding between the following candidates: <span><span><span>🌯</span> <!-- -->Burrito</span></span>, <span><span><span>🍔</span> <!-- -->Burger</span></span>, <span><span><span>🍕</span> <!-- -->Pizza</span></span>, <span><span><span>🍪</span> <!-- -->Cookie</span></span>.</p><p>This preference profile can also be represented in the below form, as we
saw previously:</p><p>Or as an array of duels:</p><p>Or as a graph of duels:</p><p>It shows that no alternative wins all pairwise duels:
There is a cycle between <span><span><span>🍔</span> <!-- -->Burger</span></span>, <span><span><span>🍕</span> <!-- -->Pizza</span></span> and <span><span><span>🍪</span> <!-- -->Cookie</span></span>,
this vote has no Condorcet winner.
In this kind of scenario, it is not obvious who should win.</p><h2><p><a href="#4-condorcet-voting-systems"><span role="img" aria-label="link"></span></a>4 Condorcet voting systems</p></h2><p>The <strong>Copeland</strong> voting system, which we saw above, validates the Condorcet criteria.

<h3><strong>Conclusions</strong> from the Academic Research</h3>



<p>We looked at research papers from the last 30 years to evaluate our set of teaching strategies undertaken in our Japanese language learning application called <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">Japanese Complete</a>.  We found that the scholarly and academic studies referred to confirm:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Kanji [logographs of mainland Asian origin] are categorized as the main impediment in acquisition of the Japanese language</strong> and anything to ease their acquisition from rote-memorization will help learners greatly.</li><li><strong>Computer aided learning of Japanese is superior to textbook-based</strong> learning <strong>when</strong> <strong>paired with timely and useful feedback</strong> for the learner, with politeness language, grammar, kanji, and more. [4, 5, 7, 12, 17]</li><li><strong>Kanji are processed by different parts of the brain compared to English letters and Hiragana mora,</strong> suggesting that placing special emphasis on learning Kanji as glyphs or <em>graphics with associated meanings <strong>first</strong></em> establishes a firm foundation upon which to then learn readings and pronunciations. [2, 6]</li><li>Kanji have <em>logographic</em> as well as <em>phonographic</em> value; <strong>cultural, etymological, and mnemonic strategies are not only more effective than rote-memorization strategies for learning, they also remove a lot of anxiety and perceived inscrutability of kanji, making kanji learning fun and intriguing</strong> instead of a chore.  The main techniques presented in these papers include component-analysis of kanji [what we call subkanji learning], and pairing kanji with graphical and mnemonic aides such as stories or imaginal scenes. [6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15]</li><li>It is very likely that native speakers of languages featuring kanji create <em>some sort</em> of meaning-word associated with each kanji, whether able to give voice to it or not (“unconscious knowledge”), suggesting strongly that <strong>by teaching kanji meaning-words first one is creating a very helpful and direct shortcut to their successful assimilation.</strong> [6, 9, 10]</li><li>One paper suggests the use of an “orthographic gradient” where terms are first shown as color-coded Hiragana, and later instances are shown as color-coded kanji using the same coloration, allowing learners to make an implied association of equality.  <strong>This idea of “orthographic gradient” confirms the efficacy of our innovative approach “Kanji in English Context” where we t取ke kanji and pl置ce them in an 英ngl語sh c文nt脈xt [take, place, English, context] to expedite acquisition</strong> and increase familiarity with the plurality of [English] words kanji can represent. [11, 16]</li><li><strong>Acquisition of Japanese grammar and sequence continues to be the most challenging part of learning the language for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students,</strong> suggesting that the focus for the first several semesters of learning ought be grammar-focused.  Nouns are acquired at a linear rate no matter the level of grammar competency, and thus it would suggest that the learning of nouns can actually be greatly delayed without any negative impact on comprehension; rather, focus on grammar first would result in greatly improved comprehension when nouns are later added to one’s cogent grammar understanding. </li><li><strong>Very Accurate Japanese Pitch Accent</strong> can be trained and learned swiftly with the right learning materials (showing pitch contours on screen and having learners listen and repeat). [17]</li><li><strong>One’s native language shapes how one acquires second+ languages.</strong> [3, 13]</li></ol>

<p>“The result showed that our bilingual Japanese subjects have large overlaps in the neural substrates for phonological processing of both native and second language.  Our finding supports the idea that the neural systems of second language reading are shaped by native language.” </p>

<p>“Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain activation from Japanese readers reading hiragana (syllabic) and kanji (logographic) sentences, and English as a second language (L2). Kanji showed more activation than hiragana in right-hemisphere occipito-temporal lobe areas associated with visuospatial processing; hiragana, in turn, showed more activation than kanji in areas of the brain associated with phonological processing. L1 results underscore the difference in visuospatial and phonological processing demands between the systems. Reading in English as compared to either of the Japanese systems showed more activation in inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. The additional activation in English in these areas may have been associated with an increased cognitive demand for phonological processing and verbal working memory.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most important finding is that in all three languages that we have analysed acquisition appears to take place in two phases, during the first of which the child gradually acquires six to eight simple forms corresponding to ‘basic’ spatial meanings encoded in the target language.”</p>



<p>“In the second phase of acquisition, the child’s productive repertoire and the frequency of its use increase in a way that is reminiscent of (though perhaps less dramatic than) the ‘vocabulary explosion’ in nominal usage. The extension of the repertoire takes different courses, depending on the structure of the target language. In all languages it can be expected that the repertoire within the form class which is dominant in expressing spatial relational meaning will continue to expand, and that this will remain the most frequently employed vehicle for the child’s expression of spatial relational meaning throughout and perhaps beyond the third year of life.”</p>



<p>“In languages, such as Japanese, in which spatial relational meaning is overtly distributed over different form classes, the second phase will involve both an increase in the range of types controlled in the dominant form class (in this case,verbs), and the extension of the acquisition process to the other form classes (in this case, particles and nouns). Both the slow pace of acquisition in the non-dominant forms classes, and the fact that the meanings initially expressed using nouns are cognate with those already expressed using verbs, suggest that, in Japanese too, the learning process continues to be governed in the second phase by a conservative strategy. It can perhaps be seen as follows: the child employs the already acquired meanings as clues for the establishment of new centres in new form classes for the repetition with respect to these new form classes of the radial strategy already successfully employed with respect to the dominant form class.”</p>

<p>“To support the foreigners learning JPE [Japanese Politeness Expressions], a PDA-based context-aware language learning support environment was proposed. This environment supports the learners to learn JPE according to the different situations in the real world. There are two version of the prototype system for this environment. In this paper, design, implementation and evaluation of JAPELAS2 are presented. From the experiment, we found the system provides the correct polite-expression based on hyponymy, social distance and situation through the identification of the target user and the location. The experiment showed that the system was quite useful and using this system made understanding the appropriate level of politeness easy by changing roles and situations.”</p>

<p>“The results of the study show that given the same grammar notes and exercises, <strong>ongoing intelligent computer feedback is more effective than simple workbook answer sheets for developing learners’ grammatical skill in producing Japanese particles and sentences.</strong> A significant difference between Nihongo-CALI and the workbook instruction was observed in the production tests but not in the comprehension tests. This is consistent with Flynn’s hypothesis that grammatical competence is less critical in comprehension than in production. As suggested by Pederson and Dunkel, the present study also confirms that the use of a medium (i.e., computer) alone does not bring better effects; rather the quality of the messages produced by the medium affects the result. This is based on the fact that the intelligent version of Nihongo-CALI is significantly more effective than the workbook instruction”</p>

					<p>Trump administration lies constantly but doesn’t even attempt to make it seem like they aren’t lying.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, this kind of cynicism was referred to as the “reverse cargo cult” effect.</p>
<p>In a regular cargo cult, you have people who see an airstrip, and the cargo drops, so they build one out of straw, hoping for the same outcome. They don’t know the difference between a straw airstrip and a real one, they just want the cargo.</p>
<p>In a reverse cargo cult, you have people who see an airstrip, and the cargo drops, so they build one out of straw. But there’s a twist:</p>
<p>When they build the straw airstrip, it <em>isn’t</em> because they are hoping for the same outcome. They know the difference, and know that because their airstrip is made of straw, it certainly won’t yield any cargo, but it serves another purpose. They don’t lie to the rubes and tell them that an airstrip made of straw will bring them cargo. That’s an easy lie to dismantle. Instead, what they do is make it clear that the airstrip is made of straw, and doesn’t work, but then tell you that the other guy’s airstrip doesn’t work either. They tell you that <strong>no airstrips yield cargo</strong>. The whole <em>idea of cargo</em> is a lie, and those fools, with their fancy airstrip made out of wood, concrete, and metal is just as wasteful and silly as one made of straw.</p>
<p>1980s Soviets knew that their government was lying to them about the strength and power of their society, the Communist Party couldn’t hide all of the dysfunctions people saw on a daily basis. This didn’t stop the Soviet leadership from lying. Instead, they just accused the West of being equally deceptive. <em>“Sure, things might be bad here, but they are just as bad in America, and in America people are actually foolish enough to believe in the lie! Not like you, clever people. You get it. You know it is a lie.”</em></p>
<p>Trump’s supporters don’t care about being lied to. You can point out the lies until you’re blue in the face, but it makes no difference to them. Why? Because it is just a game to them. The media lies, bloggers lie, politicians lie, it’s just all a bunch of lies. Facts don’t matter because those are lies also. Those trolls on Twitter, 4Chan, T_D, etc. are just having a good laugh. They are congratulating each other for being so smart. We are fools for still believing in anything. There is no cargo, and probably never was.</p>

      <p>About <a href="https://www.sevarg.net/2020/06/21/apple-and-arm-transition/">six months ago</a>, I speculated a bit on what Apple might do with their upcoming (rumored at the time) ARM transition.  Apple did it, has shipped hardware, and I’ve had a chance to play with for a while now.  I’ve also, as is usual for me, gone down some weird paths - like ARM Linux virtualization, x86 Linux emulation, and BOINC in an ARM VM!</p>

<p>The fastest Linux machine I’ve <em>ever</em> used is a hardware virtualized install on the Apple M1 - and this post covers how to do it!</p>

<h2 id="the-short-2020-m1-mac-mini-review">The Short 2020 M1 Mac Mini Review</h2>

<p>While I don’t generally <a href="https://www.sevarg.net/2020/02/01/finances-technology-repair-and-enough/">make a habit</a> of buying brand new, just-released hardware, I made an exception for the M1 and bought a M1 Mac Mini to replace an Intel Mac Mini (which had replaced a perfectly function 2014 iMac I’d still be running if the monitor hadn’t failed - the display assembly, used, cost $600 in not-cracked condition).  The Intel one wasn’t doing most of what I wanted (to say the GPU sucked would be an understatement), I’ve been lusting after a mid-range ARM desktop for a long while, and the fact that things would be broken on it doesn’t bother me - it’s not a production machine for me, so I’m happy to run on the bleeding, slightly broken edge.  It’s a common theme with ARM desktop use, especially 64-bit, so this is no different.</p>

<p>How is it?  It’s <em>fast.</em>  It’s <em>really, really fast.</em>  Not just for the power - that’s amazing too, but simple, flat out, using it for stuff.  It’s amazing.  I figured it would be really good, but it’s beyond good, crossing into the “Yeah, I’ll call this magical…” realm.  The fan almost never comes off idle, power consumption (I work in a solar office, remember?) is a rounding error, and it just does what I ask of it in a real hurry.</p>

<p>I mean, it’ll even play Kerbal Space Program with pretty darn good graphics!  That’s an x86 game with no native port yet, and it’s not exactly a CPU sipper!</p>

<p>This does mean that, once again, Jeb ends up stuck places he’d probably rather not be stuck.  Lock your staging, or a thumb twitch might just leave you 100m above Mun with no descent (or ascent!) stage left attached…</p>

<p>Should you buy one of Apple’s M1 devices?  Probably not - wait 6 months for the next round of hardware, and buy then.  Most of the software ecosystem quirks will be worked out by then, and just about everything will work.  For now, there are enough weird little broken corner cases that I’d suggest holding off unless you’re OK with that and want legitimately insane battery life and performance.</p>

<p>But an awful lot does work, and it works really well.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, I <em>know,</em> your overclocked AMD ThreadBlaster 7970XP, with enough threads, will build the kernel faster on 400W.  All this performance is on about 30W, and this is their first pass at it.  Just wait…</p>

<h2 id="rosetta-2-they-did-what">Rosetta 2: They Did WHAT?</h2>

<p>We also have an answer now to the insane x86 translation performance (around 80% of native performance, give or take - and, yes, this does mean that the M1 runs x86 binaries faster than an awful lot of x86 hardware out there).  I’ve messed around with running x86 binaries in emulation on ARM before, and got about 10% of native performance on a Rpi4.  Painful.  Apple’s Rosetta 2 gets a lot of benefit from being a pre-compiling translator (for most cases - it still has to interpret JIT type workloads), but most people figured that would get you to 50% - at best.  The ARM memory model is so radically different from x86 that you end up sprinkling memory barriers everywhere to guarantee cross threaded consistency, and that really hurts performance.</p>

<p>The issue is that on x86, if you write memory addresses in a certain sequence, <em>all other cores</em> will see the writes in the same sequence. If you write some blob of data and then write the “Ready!” flag, by the time other cores see the flag change value, you can be certain that the blob of data has been written.  ARM has no such guarantees without explicit (and slow) memory barrier instructions, and this is why the x86 emulation on ARM Windows was painful - guaranteeing correctness of a translated binary on a weaker memory model is slow.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Apple <em>isn’t</em> doing it purely in software - they have <a href="https://github.com/saagarjha/TSOEnabler">Total Store Ordering</a> support in their hardware!  When the M1 runs a translated x86 binary, the OS just tells the chip, “Hey, use x86 memory ordering for this thread.”  Things built natively for ARM can take advantage of the performance gains of the memory reordering, and things that requires strict ordering get strict ordering.  It’s a very, very clever way to totally bypass the memory ordering issues with translated binaries, and it’s not a thing in any other ARM chip on the planet (I’d say yet, but I really don’t think this will become a popular thing to implement - perks of Apple building their own silicon).</p>

<h2 id="onto-virtual-machines-lets-build-qemu">Onto Virtual Machines: Let’s Build qemu!</h2>

<p>Now, to the core of the post: Building qemu to run hardware virtualized ARM Linux!  I’m starting with <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/e4313b9c14e968764a52375da41b4278">these excellent instructions</a> as a guide, but I’ve got some extra patches thrown in (because it doesn’t run x86 emulation my M1 with 11.1), and I’m doing a few other things in the process.</p>

<p>You’ll need XCode installed, and we’ll be using <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> to install  some of the prerequisites for building qemu.  Plus some patches to the source, and… it’s all good fun, I promise!  What I don’t promise is that this will work perfectly for you, though I’ll try!</p>

<p>Yes, I know Parallels has a tech preview out, and you still can’t change the resolution of a Linux guest.  If you’re fine with 1024x768, it certainly works, but… we can do better with open source!</p>

<h4 id="installing-the-prerequisites-homebrew-and-xcode">Installing the Prerequisites: Homebrew and XCode</h4>

<p>You’ll need the XCode command line tools (gcc and such) to build this, so if you don’t already have those installed, go ahead and install XCode from the App Store.  It’s huge.</p>

<p>I understand you can also install them from the command line, if you don’t want the full install, by running <code>xcode-select --install</code>.  That’s the first thing I do with any Mac, so I had them laying around.  You may have to agree to some license terms as well - it’s been a while since I had a clean install.</p>

<p>If you use the normal Homebrew install path, you’ll get x86 Homebrew, running under Rosetta.  This is fine for most use cases, and it certainly <em>works</em> better than the ARM Homebrew (half the code won’t build under ARM), but it’s no good for ARM native dependencies, and we’re going to be building ARM native qemu.</p>

<p>If you rely on x86 homebrew, well… uh… fix the ARM stuff that doesn’t build?  Or install to a different directory, I suppose.  I have no great advice on parallel Homebrew installs, sorry.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cd ~
mkdir homebrew &amp;&amp; curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
sudo mv homebrew /opt/homebrew
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
brew update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will run some git fetches, some builds, and you should generally have a working brew install.  Like XCode, this may take a while, depending on your internet connection.  My ISPs have been sucking more than usual lately, and I don’t keep a local mirror of Homebrew, so… coffee time.</p>

<p>You should then be able to install the dependencies for qemu:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>brew install ninja pkgconfig glib pixman
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="fetching-patching-and-building-qemu">Fetching, Patching, and Building qemu</h4>

<p>Next step: we’re going to download the qemu source, check out the proper version, apply a couple patches, and build it!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/list/?series=400619">first patch series</a> is the core of the updates - it adds <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor">Hypervisor.framework</a> support (Apple’s recent “So, you wanna do hardware virtualization without a kernel module…” framework), adds the ability to sign the output binary to allow it to use that, and various other things related to Apple Silicon support.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/20210103145055.11074-1-r.bolshakov@yadro.com/">second patch series</a> isn’t actually required to run hardware virtualization, but if you wanted to mess around with the (somewhat awful, but still usable) performance of x86 VMs on the M1, you’ll need this.  Apple Silicon prevents memory pages from being both writable and executable at the same time, and this adds the toggles to handle things properly so the JIT engine can work.</p>

<p>If you <em>don’t</em> apply the second patches, and you try to run x86 system emulation, you’ll get the exceedingly unhelpful error “Could not allocate dynamic translator buffer” when you try to run it.</p>

<p>And, of course, if you’re not interested in x86 emulation, you can skip the <code>x86_64-softmmu</code> and <code>i386-softmmu</code> options in the target-list for configure.</p>

<p>Sit back, relax, wait… actually, not very long, this system is blazing fast on all 8 cores, and you should have some qemu binaries!</p>

<h4 id="grab-an-arm-ubuntu-iso-and-an-efi-blob-create-a-disk-image">Grab an ARM Ubuntu ISO and an EFI blob, Create a Disk Image</h4>

<p>There are plenty of ways to install the ARM version of Ubuntu, but there’s a convenient desktop build now at <a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/focal/daily-live/current/">https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/focal/daily-live/current/</a> - grab <code>focal-desktop-arm64.iso</code>.  You do NOT want the ‘amd64’ version - make sure you get ‘arm64’ or it won’t work!</p>

<p>You also need a EFI blob built for ARM.  The instructions I’m working from cover how to build it with your own ARM VM (and include a link to some built ones), but I’ve also uploaded one for you, if you happen to want it: <a href="https://www.sevarg.net/images/2021-qemu-m1/QEMU_EFI.fd">QEMU_EFI.fd</a></p>

<p>While you could just run the live ISO, there’s no fun in that - create a disk image for the install (you’ll be doing this from the qemu/build directory you were just in, and stick the image somewhere fast).  I’ll assume you’ve put the QEMU_EFI.fd file in the same directory.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.</p>

<p>These are rare skills, responsible for making them who they are. Most normal people, including me, don’t realise it. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</p>

<p>However, I aim to change that. What follows below are 10 skills sourced from admirable people that I want to develop.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">Learn to take compounding seriously</h2>

<p>It’s not just your wealth that compounds, but life experience and knowledge, too.</p>

<p>So, learn the most basic, most useful skills first. The longer you wait to learn skills like these, the less time there is for compounding magic. That’s what this entire list is about: powerful skills to learn and use for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>And even though you’ve heard about compounding, this item is first on the list, because <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/taking-ideas-seriously.html">taking ideas seriously is hard</a>.</p>

<p>A good way to figure out what compounds is <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">to figure out what’s a platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-develop-taste">Learn to develop taste</h2>

<p>Despite prevalent beliefs, taste isn’t subjective.</p>

<p>While it may seem like it on the outside, when you say “I just love this painting” or “I just love this coffee machine” - all it means is that the defining characteristics are illegible to you. And noticing this is the first step.</p>

<p>Let’s take a specific example. Say you’re designing a high quality clay pot - and you’ve never done this before.</p>

<p>What’s a good way to develop taste for quality here?</p>

<p>If you’ve heard this claypot parable, you know the answer: start by making lots of crap pots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A,” forty pounds a “B,” and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an “A.”</p><p>

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. - <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9o17A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art and Fear</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Let others tell you what you’ve made is crap. Learn why. Notice when they tell you something is great. Figure out why.</p>

<p>This transfers to writing as well: Popular advice to get better is to write a lot of junk, do it a 100 times, and pay particular attention to what is received well. Here’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another example - developing taste for design</a>.</p>

<p>In effect, you bootstrap good taste by first learning what others consider good. Then, <a href="#learn-to-see-systems">you see the system behind it</a>. Then you break the rules and still manage to awe.</p>

<p>Then you’ve developed taste.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-sequence-things-well">Learn to sequence things well</h2>

<p>Waking up when others are asleep and getting lots done is a super power. It’s born out of a system of <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/sequencing-things-in-the-right-order.html">learning to sequence things well</a>.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right time for that Netflix binge.</p>

<p>It means being prepared before the meeting, not scrambling to get things done after.</p>

<p>It means reading the coursebook before the lecture, not after.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-what-others-see">Learn to see what others see</h2>

<p>How well can you understand other people? Can you sense their desires, their concerns, and what events lead to those desires and concerns?</p>

<p>If you can do this, you can understand them. But not before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. - <a href="https://amzn.to/2KKe8Px" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender’s Game</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth going this far because understanding is powerful. It helps you empathise. It helps you negotiate. It helps you figure out why you don’t have product-market fit. It helps you learn quickly: you can switch through personas and see what will and won’t work.</p>

<p>How do you do learn to see? I know no better way than to practice. Try it a 100 times. <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe">Come back next year</a>, and maybe I’ll have a better way once I’ve done it a 100 times.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-make-and-execute-decisions-quickly">Learn to make and execute decisions quickly</h2>

<p>Most people have a bias towards analysis-paralysis versus getting shit done.</p>

<p>When decisions are reversible - and they mostly are - speed is a super power. Cultivating a habit of making decisions quickly, and then executing them is better than just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Training this skill begins as easily as deciding what to eat on a huge menu. It’s a small step, but over time, <a href="#learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">even the smallest steps compound</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hesitation is always easy, rarely useful” - Prof. Quirrel alterego, <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example in the context of business</a>. And a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1345140364995227648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet from Sam Altman</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-spot-a-convex-or-concave-world">Learn to spot a convex or concave world</h2>

<p>In the world of viral infections, a 50% lockdown is worse than a 0% and a 100% lockdown, both. The virus isn’t contained, and businesses have to shut down, too.</p>

<p>In the world of immigration policies, letting some specific people in is better than letting no one or everyone in. The middle ground is better than the extremes.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is great, you’re in a concave disposition.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is worse than either, you’re in a convex disposition.</p>

<p>The world is sometimes concave, and sometimes convex. Knowing your topology can help you make better decisions.</p>

<p>I first noted this when <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin explained it</a>. Read it for more concrete examples.</p>

<!-- ## Learn to do obvious things -->

<h2 id="learn-to-tell-stories">Learn to tell stories</h2>

<p>People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a>, but it’s the power of stories over facts. The right framing gets you further than all the facts combined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas &amp; facts contextualised by stories are more powerful than either alone.</p>

<p><i></i><b>The Skill of Storytelling</b><br>
There’s lots to unpack here, and this is the first skill I’ve been working on for the past few months. Watch out for a long blogpost in 2 weeks!</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-dive-into-the-source-code-when-documentation-isnt-enough">Learn to dive into the source code when documentation isn’t enough</h2>

<p>Sometimes, there’s no precedent for what you want to do. Or the people who did it before didn’t write a manual.</p>

<p>In cases like these, figuring things out for yourself is powerful. Research papers and obscure books aren’t just for scientists. They’re freely available on the internet* for all of humanity to use. Learn to use it. Learn about resources like <a href="https://sci-hub.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciHub</a>, <a href="https://libgen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGen</a>, and hiring researchers. You’re allowed to hire people (specially graduate students!) to satisfy your research concerns.</p>

<p>… and when you’re done, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#writing-code">preserve context for future you</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like trying to use an API that has no documentation. Would’ve been easy if there was documentation, but there isn’t. So you got to do it the hard way: read the source code and figure out what you need to make things work.</p>

<p>It’s also like <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html">figuring out what you need to build rockets yourself</a> when existing ones are too expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/37sHjeisS9uJufi4u/scholarship-how-to-do-it-efficiently" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More resources here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-be-specific">Learn to be specific</h2>

<p>Every time I gave an example above, I was training my specificity muscles.</p>

<p>Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about. Not being specific is a sign of that. The more abstract the word, the harder it is to pin down a meaning.</p>

<p>For example, “negative ramifications” doesn’t tell you what exactly happened, while “the sonic boom from the new supersonic jet destroyed windows in a 100m radius” is a lot more specific.</p>

<p>Learn to be specific, and learn to spot when others aren’t. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-systems">Learn to see systems</h2>

<p>There’s two kinds of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob, who will see this list, find some skills very interesting, and then go about honing those skills</li>
  <li>Alice, who will see this list, and wonder how I came up with these
<!-- - The Inspiration-Junkie, who will lurk and move on to the next inspiring post without changing anything -->
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice would then try to understand the system that generated these ideas. Then, she’ll adopt the system, and come up with skills possibly more relevant to herself.</p>

<p>Having the option to do both is powerful. Since Bob is the default, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">learn to be like Alice</a>. Choose <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">systems when things are important</a> to you. Choose hacks when you need a quickfix.</p>

January 10, 2021 | http://blog.joshhaas.com/2016/10/the-weirdness-of-kentucky-route-zero/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blog.joshhaas.com/2016/10/the-weirdness-of-kentucky-route-zero/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>In <a href="http://blog.joshhaas.com/2016/10/mr-robot-is-not-weird-enough/">my last post</a>, I took issue with the TV show <i>Mr. Robot</i> for not being weird enough. Although imaginative and compelling, its universe is well-ordered: everything happens for a reason.</p>
<div>

<p>If you’re looking for media to consume that doesn’t suffer from that problem, I recommend <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/"><i>Kentucky Route Zero</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>I <a href="http://blog.joshhaas.com/2016/10/yet-another-review-of-the-trump-clinton-debate/">previously discussed</a> <i>Kentucky Route Zero</i> (<i>KR0</i> for short) in the context of the first Trump-Clinton debate. It’s relevant to that because it’s a tour through coal-country America, and it engages with the desolation there that’s fueling Trump’s support.</p>

<p>As a portrait of the region, it’s a Picasso or maybe a Goya, not a Velázquez. It has moments where it approaches documentary realism, but it mostly traverses an imaginary landscape reflecting its creators’ perceptions, inspired by their real-life travels in Kentucky.</p>

<p><i>KR0</i>’s medium is a computer game, but “game” is misleading. There’s no element of skill. It has the interface of an adventure game, but unlike other games in that genre, your progression through the story isn’t blocked by puzzles to solve. Rather, it’s more like a work of interactive fiction. The story is mainly told through dialogue, though the soundtrack and visuals are important pieces of the experience.</p>
<div>

<p>The medium is appropriate: it makes a better game than it would a book or a tv show. The ambition seems to be to create a world, and the ability to explore it freely is important. There’s a narrative, but the world is alive beyond the narrative, and there’s a lot to discover outside the main plot.</p>

</div>
<p>The three-person studio that produced <i>KR0</i>, Cardboard Computer, has been trying to erase the lines between their fictional universe and the real one. They’ve released a number of companion pieces to the game, including <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/the-entertainment/">an experience for Occulus Rift or Mac / PC</a> where you participate as a cast member of a fictional 1973 production of a one-act play. The play appears to depict events that occur in a bar a few hours before the character you play in <i>KR0</i> visits the bar in the game, but the fictional set designer for the 1973 production — ie, a real person in the production’s fictional reality — is also a character in <i>KR0</i>. In case that wasn’t confusing enough, you can buy a <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/lem-doolittle/the-entertainment/paperback/product-21312732.html">print copy of the script</a>, published under the name of the fictional author.</p>

<p>It’s not a bad play, either. As the script advertises, “The one-act play “A Reckoning,” set in a tavern in central Kentucky, is Doolittle’s take on the sort of barroom tragedy made popular by O’Neill, Gorky, etc.”, and I would say it stands on its own as a piece of theater, although the ending will have more resonance if you’ve played through <i>KR0</i>.</p>

<p>This almost pedantic accumulation of fictional detail, both inside and outside the game — names, biographies, places, events — lends believability and power to <i>KR0</i>’s magical realist plot-line. Because the production team took such great pains to create verisimilitude, the more fantastic elements of the game feel justified: hauntings, strange and implausible creatures, a whiskey company whose employees are all glowing skeletons, and the titular Route 0, a hidden underground highway through non-euclidean space.</p>

<p>The game’s plot is simple and unobtrusive compared to the sprawling, strange world it is set in. Conway, a truck driver for an antiques store, is trying to make a delivery to Dogwood Drive, a street that doesn’t show up on his maps. As he looks for it, he picks up some traveling companions, and we learn more about his and their pasts. <i>KR0</i> isn’t complete yet —the game is divided into five acts, and final one hasn’t been released — so I don’t know yet if Conway ever makes it to his destination.  In fact, I still don’t know what he’s delivering, or to whom.</p>

<p>As a player, the main way you exert agency is through your choice of dialogue options. Unusually for adventure-style games, your dialogue choices don’t seem to affect the plot. Rather, they affect the past: you can give the characters different backstories, influence their temperaments, change how they see the world and treat each other. It’s a limited degree of freedom: I haven’t flexed the game aggressively to see how divergent you can make it, but my understanding is that the basic outline of who the characters are always remains the same. It’s more of a matter of altering the shadings.</p>

<p>The net effect of the simple plot, the strange, expansive world, and the freedom to emphasize and explore different aspects of the characters is that playing the game doesn’t feel like you’re being told a story, with themes and a moral. Rather, it feels more like an invitation to you, the player, to interpret what you’re confronted with. The game gives you a lot of details to work with, and powerful images and emotions, but leaves you to decide what to think about it all.</p>

<p>At its heart, I think <i>Kentucky Route Zero</i> is a meditation on entropy. Certainly, entropy is the unifying characteristic of the game world. <i>KR0</i>’s setting is a Kentucky that’s been devastated by the collapse of the coal industry and by the 2008 housing crisis. Everything you encounter is in some state of falling apart. The gas station you refuel at has overdue electric bills. The bar can’t buy alcohol any more. The coal mine is abandoned. Conway’s dog looks like she’s seen better days. All the characters have various stories of poverty, alcoholism, loss, and debt.</p>

<p>Entropy has different facets. There are many different stances that one can take towards it. <i>KR0</i> seems to explore each of them in turn, weighing them, inviting you to partake.</p>

<p>The most basic stances are the emotional ones: despair, grief, and anger. There’s certainly plenty of that throughout the game. In one particularly powerful moment, you come across a memorial for coal miners who drowned when some tunnels were flooded in an accident a decade or so ago.  The memorial is a collection of hard-hats floating in an underground lake, accompanied by an angry, hand-written sign accusing the mining company of negligence. In another moment, you meet a team of engineers who spent their lives trying to build a computer system (called Xanadu, presumably a reference to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">real world could-have-been internet competitor</a>), who are now just sitting around hopelessly, having given up on ever completing their lives’ work.</p>

<p>Another stance is simple momentum: keeping going on as long as you can. One character you meet is a switchboard technician, the last one on her team after all her coworkers were laid off by the phone company automating the systems. They couldn’t quite automate her, so she keeps plugging away, alone in a tunnel, connecting call after call. There’s also a church, relocated to a warehouse by some beauracrats, where the congregation all drifted away, the preacher left, and now it’s just a janitor who puts on pre-recorded sermons every Sunday.</p>

<p>Entropy and grief can also give rise to beauty. <i>KR0</i> has plenty of beautiful moments too. The game has a gorgeous soundtrack, mixing electronic music and ambience with bluegrass classics. The bluegrass pieces, performed by a mysterious wandering trio who occasionally wander across your path, are all explorations of loss and hardship, transmuted into folk songs and hymns. The visual palette of the game is mixture of blues and oranges, mostly subdued and minimalist, but occasionally spectacular. Everything has a satisfying organic, analog feel. Radio systems crackle, televisions hum, computers react to strange magnetic fluctuations.</p>

<p>Yet another approach to entropy is to consume and exploit it. At various points in the game, you encounter modern, structured institutions, that are in the process of channeling the breakdown toward their own ends. There’s a whiskey distillery that’s steadily acquiring the balance sheets and souls of the folks you meet. You get to take a tour of its expansive, industrially-clean factory in an amazing descent-into-hell sequence that feels like Dante meets OSHA. The local power company also seems to be on the march. There are also more highbrow institutions consuming the entropy. For instance, you visit the “Bureau of Reclaimed Space”, which seems to represent government, taking in weirdness and outputting paperwork. In another interlude, you find an entire town that’s been transplanted to be inside a museum, the residents still living in their houses, enclosed in a giant glass warehouse.</p>

<p>Somewhat related to high-brow consumption, there’s intellectualization of entropy. <i>KR0</i> has a steady stream of references to academia. You meet a number of characters who have spent time in the grad student / post-doc limbo space, and there’s a lot of art and math jargon. From an academic perspective, entropy is a source of phenomena to record, analyze, and write papers about — hopefully publishable ones. This content is a reflection of the game itself, which in many ways feels like a modern art project. <i>KR0</i> is obsessed with topology and imaginary spaces. Characters muse about space aloud, and as you move around the game, you explore a number of different spaces and means of navigating them: a driving map of Kentucky as navigated by truck, the same map as navigated by a bird, a bureaucratic office building where you ride an elevator up and down, a pure mathematical abstraction that you traverse by turning around at certain symbols, an endless underground river where you are swept along on a boat, among others. This self-conscious exploration invites you to see the entropy in <i>KR0’s</i> world as something to think about and study.</p>

<p>Finally, entropy gives rise to newness: the inadvertent creativity of random processes. Two of the more memorable characters you meet are a pair of androids that, in their telling, emerged from the mines as shapeless lumps, and transformed themselves into a pair of motorcycle-riding musicians, who are now <a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/kentucky-route-zeros-junebug-set-release-tktk-album-androids/">releasing an album outside the game</a>. Abandoned things in <i>KR0</i> tend to take on a life of their own.  A hobo sets up shop as an organist in a church converted into an office …</p></div></div>

<h3>Clinical Need</h3><p>When COVID-19 first hit, governments across the globe had to make tough public health decisions with little information. The measures they put in place to reduce spread can prevent COVID-19-related deaths but can also have <i>negative</i> consequences on physical and mental health😷.</p><p>Understanding what factors determine risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19 can help guide these policies. For example, people who are high risk may be advised to shield at home.</p><p>To understand these risk factors, there was a need to analyse large volumes of medical records. Unfortunately, getting access to these records and <sample>linking them appropriately</sample> typically requires lots of regulatory approvals and takes a long time.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>To really understand COVID, we need to link up clinical appointment notes with test results, death records, etc.</p><p>However, this information is typically kept in different locations.</p>

<p>As a result, it’s hard to get really big datasets but <sample>the bigger, the better</sample>.</p><p>So what could we do? This research team came up with a great solution…</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>The larger the dataset, the greater statistical strength you have for the analysis.</p><p>In a smaller dataset, you might see trends - but then not have enough data to confidently say it is not due to random variation.</p><p>This is really important when looking at lots of different variables contributing to an outcome, as they did in this study.</p>

<h3>What did they do?</h3><p>They assembled a team of clinicians👨‍⚕️, programmers👩‍💻, data scientists👨‍🔬 and epidemiologists🧑‍💼 and came up with a new way of extracting and analysing health data. They called this platform OpenSAFELY.</p><p>The traditional approach is to: (i) clean data and <sample>pseudonymise it</sample> (ii) download it, then (iii) run an analysis.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>This is a bit like anonymisation, but not as strict. Information that could enable the individual to be identified (such as date of birth or home address) is modified, but can still be re-identified by those (ie. the researchers) using a ‘de-identification key’.</p>

<p><span>
<p>However, this isn’t particularly secure (what if someone’s laptop gets stolen?), pseudonymisation isn’t fail-safe and it allows <sample>repeated analyses which risks identifying false relationships</sample>.</p><p>This team’s new approach is to upload the code for analysing the data to the electronic health record directly. The code is then run and returns the results. The data never leaves the health record. This maintains privacy and prevents repeated analyses 💯</p><p>They used this to look at the factors affecting risk of dying from COVID-19, in a GP health record dataset of 17 million individuals.</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>There’s always a possibility that patterns identified in the data are down to chance.</p><p>If a test has “95% confidence” it means there’s a 5% chance it happened by chance.</p><p>We can bear this in mind when interpreting results. However, what happens if we run multiple analyses, looking for a true result?</p><p>We give the data lots of chances to fall into that 5% that is due to chance.</p><p>With a pressure to publish interesting findings, this can incentivise researchers to run multiple tests in order to find these relationships – which may not be true. These may seem interesting, but they’re bad science.</p><p>This is known as ‘data dredging’ or ‘p-hacking’.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3><p>1️⃣ First, after the researcher decides which data they want to analyse (e.g. all patients with diabetes) — they write some code to extract that from the health records.</p><p>2️⃣ When that code is run, they receive data to download. However, the data is a placeholder. It looks like the real data - but all the values are made up! Knowing the structure of the data helps the researchers write the code.</p><p>3️⃣ The working code is sent over to the health record (packaged up in a wrapper called <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>) where it performs the analysis. Only the results are returned to the researchers - the patient data never leaves the health records. So no-one (not even the researchers) see the raw patient data.</p>
<h3>What did they find?</h3><p>They looked at data from 17 million people and found COVID-19-related death is increased by:</p><ul><li>Being male</li><li>Being older</li><li>Higher deprivation</li><li>BAME ethnicity (part of this explained by higher prevalence of medical problems and higher levels of deprivation)</li><li>Obesity</li><li>Various other medical conditions (such as diabetes, severe asthma, cancer and dementia)</li></ul>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<h3>Any limitations?</h3><p>This analysis was done in the early days of the pandemic. This meant we didn’t have the testing capacity we have now🧪. To circumvent this, the researchers included ‘<sample>clinically suspected’ cases</sample> of COVID-19 – and not just ones where it had been confirmed by a COVID-19 test. Some of these ‘positive’ cases may not have actually had COVID-19.</p><p>There were other common issues seen in data analysis on this scale: Some patients had missing data, like obesity, smoking status and ethnicity. Also, health record availability varies between region. They used data from a single GP electronic record company (TPP), whereas some regions (such as Scotland and North-East England use an alternative called EMIS). This means the sample population for the study may not represent the whole population (or indeed populations outside of England).</p>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>They don't include their definition here, but from the UK Government, this includes: new continuous cough or temperature ≥37.8°C or loss of, or change in, normal sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia)</p>

<p>It was a great feat to get this platform up-and-running and publish the analysis in such a short space of time. This type of research doesn’t usually happen that fast.</p><p>The study helped public health teams and researchers make decisions. For example, in the UK this provided support for advising at-risk populations to shield🛡.</p><p>This also presents a new paradigm for data analysis of health data, that could enable faster, more secure and more reproducible research going forward. All the code is <a href="https://github.com/opensafely/risk-factors-research">open-source and freely available</a>. This means anybody can inspect the code and other researchers are free to use it.</p><p>Since this paper, the same research group have used this platform to look at the impact on COVID-19 risk of (i) living with school-age children, (ii) HIV, (iii) ethnicity, (iv) taking hydroxychloroquine and (v) steroids with asthma or COPD.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Note this isn't an official framework Apple uses internally. Neither this post nor the author are in any way affiliated with Apple. It is however a framework you can use to understand how Apple prioritizes building products and the closest outside guess to Apples product prioritization framework.</strong></p><h3>Mental Framework</h3><p>Every task or product decision should be put into one of 4 buckets:</p><p><strong>1. Not important.</strong></p><p>Don't do it. </p><p><strong>2. Not important. But needs to be done.</strong></p><p>Do the bare minimum</p><p><strong>3. Important</strong></p><p>As good as the best. Copy the best.</p><p><strong>4. Most important</strong>.</p><p>Innovate to make sure it’s better than the best.</p><h3>Isnt this obvious?</h3><p>It is mostly. However there is one notable exception. Average. If it's looking like what you are going to do is average you are better off doing the bare minimum.</p><p>If a task is between important and not important go either way do as good as best or bare minimum. Don't do average.</p><h3>Apple&nbsp;as an example:</h3><p>Apple is probably the most intense when using this framework. A great example is their history with headphones. For years Apple shipped below average headphones with their iPhones and iPods. Apple's headphones never competed with the likes of Bose. There was nothing new, nothing innovative about them. They needed to be there for Apple's core products to function and they were. They fell into the bucket of ‘2. Not important, but needs to be done.’ Apple even encouraged you to buy third party headphones.</p><p>Once Apple noticed a new innovative product that was gaining traction (the Bragi Dash on kickstarter, and possibly before this) they created a best in class product the Apple Air Pods. This suddenly took their headphone offering from below average to best in class. You could say they were copies of the best or they were better than the best but they certainly weren't average. This had become a category that was now important to Apple. Once the Air Pods took off Apple pushed it&nbsp;to the next level moving it to most important creating the Air Pods Pro leaving everyone in their dust.</p><p><strong>Other examples of products from Apple in each category</strong></p><ol><li><p>Search - Don't care, won't do </p></li><li><p>iCloud/Safari- I'd argue it's the bare minimum they can get away with </p></li><li><p>Airpods Max - as good as the best </p></li><li><p>MacBook/iPad - better than the best </p></li></ol><p>Even if you don't agree with the categorisation you'll probably still agree that Apple has below average products and best in class products but they don't create average products. That is why they have the market dominance they do.</p><p><strong>Even Apple fails occasionally:</strong></p><p>One example of Apple failing to follow this philosophy is in their maps product. Apple Maps really is a very “average” product which came nowhere close to competing with Google Maps. It's very existence necessitates doing more than the bare minimum which would have been to show Google Maps pre-installed. Word is that they are taking this shortcoming seriously and looking to launch a new redesigned Maps soon.</p><h3>Using this framework daily </h3><p>This was originally a slack post shared with the team at <a href="https://nanonets.com/">Nanonets</a>. We use this on a daily basis when scoping tasks. We ask ourselves:</p><p><strong>Do we need to do the bare minimum or best in class?</strong></p><p>Depending on the the answer:</p><p>A) If bare minimum then the follow up question is do we even need to do it? </p><p>B) If best in class should we copy the best or be better than the best?</p><p>If you don't hold yourself to this standard you will mostly end up shipping average features that lead to average products.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: everything about your product need not be best in class. Only the the features that you matter to your customers and to you as a product/company, which also depends on and will change with the stage you are at.</p><p>I'm the CEO at <a href="https://nanonets.com/">Nanonets</a>, we are building AI to help machines see the world - starting with documents. </p><p>I write about startups, products and technology.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Have you seen “Aviator”, a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio about Howard Hughes? Then you might recall what an OCD is.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fXF8G50BPQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">Obsessive–compulsive disorder</a>&nbsp;(OCD) is a&nbsp;mental disorder&nbsp;in which a person has&nbsp;certain thoughts ”repeatedly&nbsp;(called "obsessions") or feels the need to perform&nbsp;certain routines repeatedly&nbsp;(called ”compulsions") to an extent which generates distress or impairs general functioning</strong></p>
<p>I have a mild form of OCD. Had it since teenage years. But rarely bothered me, and I mainly did not care about it much. It manifested itself maybe few times per year, where I would have to re-check few times if the door is locked, for example (which does not seem like a huge burden).</p>
<p>And so, I felt great in autumn and in the first half of December. Everything was fine, I have a job that I love, great family, and hobbies that I enjoy.</p>
<p>Then, this winter came, and It got worse. I live in a northern country (Estonia), daylight time is very short, and although I don’t suffer from SAD too much usually, it might have been a factor. And I usually try to get some vacation in warmer countries, but this year did not do it because of COVID. I also started to work from home, and it probably added to the feeling of isolation and brought me down more.</p>
<p>All in all, I don’t know what were that main factors, but probably the whole combination was too much. Occasional obsessions and compulsions started to show up more, but I mainly just shrugged them off. Then, closer to the new year, it stared to get even worse.</p>
<p><strong>And now it’s at a point where I strongly need professional help, I barely can work, lost lots of weight, have horrible anxiety all the time, and all the obsessions make my behaviour erratic at times.</strong> And this is yet another problem — its actually hard to find professional help quickly! It can be weeks or months until finding a therapist.</p>
<p><em>My main mistake was not looking for warning signs of illness.</em> It was “today it’s fine, then all will be fine” attitude, which is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Yes, my case is slightly exotic, but it relates to all other mental health issues: depression, anxiety, panic attacks, etc… <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml">Nearly 20% of people have some form of mental illness</a>, and some of the issues might not seem like a big deal until they hit hard.</p>
<p>As a tale of caution, I have some advice, which I will follow religiously in future. This is relatively obvious and simple, but let my example be a bit of a motivation to take it more seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain mood logging, and journal regularly. It would help to notice any anomalies and problems before they become serious. Don’t shrug off warning signs!</li>
<li>Find mental health checklists, like <a href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety-and-depression-checklist-k10">https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety-and-depression-checklist-k10</a>, check yourself time from time,</li>
<li>Therapy is important, especially in this times. I never did therapy, and now regret it.</li>
<li>Fitness, meditation, good diet and all kinds of self care — in this time of increased isolation it’s not just some random good habits, treating this seriously is a very important part of well-being.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I’m currently building a web version of my personal finance application, for that, I’ve chosen to use <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix Live View</a>, it’s the perfect tech for my use case.</p>

<p>In this finance web application, you have a lot of very large lists to display like the list of transactions for example.
Each wallet can have between 2k and 20k transactions and it’s unreasonable to load everything at once. 
Loading everything slows down the initial page load with those large queries and then it also slows down the browser.</p>

<p>The solution is to build a list of transactions which is streamed as you go like on Fastmail or Gmail. 
The user has the impression that they can scroll down and that the full list is already there but in reality, everything is being streamed in chunks and loads as they scroll.</p>

<p>I’ve use <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fulmicoton/fattable/">Fattable.js</a> for that purpose, it’s a small library which is making handling those large tables easier.</p>

<p>First, here is a preview of the end result:</p>

  <p>Video preview of the infinite scrolling where I scroll anywhere and you can see the list loading as I scroll dynamically</p>

<p>Now let’s dive into the code!</p>

<h2 id="the-live-view">The Live View</h2>

<p>Here is first what the live view looks like, it’s pretty straightforward and does not change much from a normal list.</p>

<p><code>@records</code> here only contains the first page of records (so a maximum of 40 records in my case), this is used to display data when loading the page so that the user can interact directly with the list without waiting for the first page to load.</p>

<p>As you can see, I’ve kept the live view as simple as possible, I’ve created a bunch of additional attributes that are used in the javascript:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>data-count</code> contains the total number of items, this is helpfull for <em>fattable.js</em> to calculate the total height of the div.</li>
  <li><code>data-page-size</code> is the chunk size which we’re loading the items with, I’m setting it to 40 for my use case but it depends of what you are building, you might want a lower page size if retreiving the data is very expensive.</li>
  <li><code>data-row-height</code> is the row height in pixels. Unlike a traditional list, with this method, we need to have every row at the exact same height.</li>
  <li><code>data-loading-block-id</code> is an id linking to the HTML which is used when loading the data, it’s what’s using the “pulse” animation in the video.</li>
</ul>



<p>The main chunk of the code is in the new <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/alex-min/7c3f008f1614fc3448717b32e122bad7">InfiniteScroll Hook</a>, it handles the link between the fattable.js library and the Live View. I’ve commented every part to make it easier to follow:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output.

</header>
<p>Have you heard of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_calculation_debate">socialist calculation debate</a>”? There are many brief essays intended to introduce a general audience to it, often expressly written to vindicate the doctrines of one political tendency or another. If you read a few of these, you will quickly notice they tend to repeat one of three stories about the debate:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Austrian economists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises">Mises</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Hayek</a> foresaw the problems a socialist society would encounter. In a few short years, the Soviet Union and its imitators in fact encountered precisely these problems. Despite this confirmation of the essentially validity of the Austrian perspective, many today persist in pursuing socialism (or policies tantamount to socialism) out of ignorance<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Late nineteenth and early twentieth century Marxist theorists had an interesting critiques of capitalist society, but no institutional blueprint to guide socialist construction. Austrian economists came along and pointed out this embarassing absence, at which point it fell to economists of a neoclassical bent and progressive sympathies (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_R._Lange">Lange</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_P._Lerner">Lerner</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_M._Taylor">Taylor</a>) to fill the gap. They showed, in varying ways, that the conceptual resources of neoclassical economics are not only useful for analyzing any society regardless of its political character, property relations, etc. but can be drawn upon to devise planning institutions for socialism. Socialism was and remains entirely possible in principle. Economists cannot claim any special authority in evaluating its desirability.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Austrian economists argued that only capitalist institutions could support rational economic decision making through the price mechanism. Neoclassical economists (e.g.&nbsp;Lange, Lerner, Taylor) showed that this was not the case, and that with the right kind of institutional design, prices could be discovered that were at least as good, if not better, than those arising in contemporary capitalism. Austrians rightly pointed out that such planning bodies would have to gather and process immense amounts of information, which was a practical impossibility in the twenties and thirties. But thanks to twenty-first century information technologies, socialism has become a practical possibility.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>These stories about the debate substantially contradict one another, and cannot all be accurate. At best they neglect interesting arguments<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Rather than immediately add my own “take” to the pile, I’d like to use this series of blog posts to do a close reading of the primary texts of the debate<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in the order they were published.</p>
<p>The obvious place to start is Ludwig von Mises’ 1920 essay, <em>Die Wirtschaftsrechnung im sozialistischen Gemeinwesen</em><span data-cites="Mises_1920"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span>, which is agreed by all commentators to be the start of the debate as it we know it today.</p>
<p>The title is generally translated as “Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth”, but “Wirtschaftsrechnung” might just as well be translated as “economic reckoning”. This is supported by the shared etymology of “rechnung” and “reckon”, but I also prefer it because “reckoning”, unlike “calculation”, seems more inclusive of the humdrum, ad hoc, non-expert, a relatively atheoretical kinds of quantitative reasoning that Mises often seems to have in mind (e.g.&nbsp;the “reckoning” of a farmer deciding whether to replace a tractor).</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll summarize the essay and provide a bit of context. I’ll refrain from discussing anticipations of Mises’ arguments by other writers, his later work, or critical responses. I hope to discuss each of these topics in future posts.</p>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical context</h2>
<p>First, a note on the context in which Mises wrote.</p>
<p>A little over a century ago, the first world war triggered a working class rebellion. For decades, socialist, communist, and anarchist workers across globe had been organizing to free themselves from the domination of the owning classes and their political representatives. It appeared they might be on the cusp of doing so in Germany and Russia.</p>
<p>A minority among these militants called for the immediate expropriation of the fields, factories, and workshops by democratically elected councils of workers, soldiers, and sailors. It appeared for a fleeting moment that this tendency would achieve a breakthrough in Germany, as many had predicted. But those hopes fizzled as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919">German uprisings were suppressed and the ill-fated Weimar Republic was founded</a> with the backing of socialists committed to a more gradual path away from capitalism.</p>
<p>Instead, the breakthrough came under Bolshevik leadership in Russia in October of 1917. Contrary to all expectations, the Bolsheviks prevailed in the ruinous civil war that followed and went on to found the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1921. “soviet” being the Russian term for “[worker] council”, this was the first state nominally committed to the principle that the mass of working people could not only democratically govern their places of work, but the entire “economic” apparatus of their society. Many politically conscious workers and professional intellectuals the world over viewed the Soviet experiment sympathetically, as an extension of their own political projects<span data-cites="Foner_1967"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span>. Mises felt socialism was on the rise<span data-cites="Mises_1920"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an age in which we are getting nearer and nearer to socialism, and even in a certain sense are already there, research into the problems of the socialist economy acquires added importance for explaining what is going on around us. Analyses of the exchange economy no longer suffice for understanding economic developments in Germany and its eastern neighbors today. Our task here is to discuss elements of a socialist commonwealth with a considerably wide scope. Under these circumstances, an attempt to explain the nature of socialist society needs no special justification.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mises-intervention">Mises’ intervention</h2>
<p>In 1920, it was not hard to find journalists, politicians, and religious leaders who were decrying Bolshevik efforts to abolish private property in the means of production as profoundly unjust.</p>
<p>For Mises, to leave the argument there was to miss a more fundamental issue. In his view, the radical workers’ program wasn’t <em>just</em> ethically objectionable and fraught with practical difficulties. It was incoherent, a wish born of deep confusion about how capitalist societies managed to deliver the goods. To abolish private property was to the undermine the institutional prerequisites for rational coordination of industrial production and stewardship of natural resources. The pursuit of socialism was likely to lead to the decline of rational thought as such<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There would be no means of determining what is rational, and hence production could never deliberately be focused on economic efficiency. The impact of this is clear, even beyond the implications for the provision of goods to men: the purpose of the market would be driven out of the very ground that is its proper domain. Would there be any such thing as a rational market at all, or indeed would thought be rational and logical? Historically, human reason developed out of economic life. Could it then hold on at all when driven away of this?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="die-wirtschaftsrechnung-summarized"><em>Die Wirtschaftsrechnung…</em> summarized</h2>
<p>This gist of Mises’ essay is as follows<a href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In capitalist societies, those who wish to make money by producing goods or services can only acquire the specific means of production they require to do so (e.g.&nbsp;land, buildings, raw materials, machinery) by offering their current owners more than rivals<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> who have alternative money-making plans for them.</p>
<p>By competing with one another for access to the means of production, and for market-share among consumers (who may themselves be businesses), the principals of private enterprises or their agents are constantly altering prevailing prices. They do so on the basis of their reckoning of productive possibilities (e.g. “maybe we could make the body of a mid-sized car out of injection-molded plastic”), specifics of time and place (e.g. “the market is glutted with moulding machines right now due to the failure of a few firms that used them”), and consumer preferences (e.g. “over the next decade, tens of millions of Americans will buy a mid-sized car and just want something cheap that won’t rust”).</p>
<p>On the basis of these reckonings they make decisions about which means of production to purchase and how to make use of them to turn a profit. Put another way, they are continuously formulating and revising business plans. These plans invariably conflict, in the sense that for some to be realized others must not be; it would be quite surprising if the annual sales targets of all auto manufacturers taken together summed to exactly the number sold in the year in question. The clash of plans in producer and consumer good markets continuously selects for profitable enterpises and tends to produce more or less stable prices for most important means of production (so-called “higher order” goods). These prices are both a product of, and influence upon, uncountable myraids of producer evaluations. They are an <em>indispensible precondition</em> for rational economic decision making.</p>
<p>Mises argues that in a socialist society in which private property has been abolished, the rivalrous clash of producer plans would necessarily cease, and thus prices <em>as we know them</em> would not be available to those organizing particular production processes. Without prices for production goods, those organizing these processes (e.g.&nbsp;making cars) could formulate plenty of technically feasible plans so long as they were assured access to the necessary inputs. But the number of such plans would be overwhelming.</p>
<p>When all production goods have a price in some common unit, anticipated marginal costs can be summed and compared with anticipated marginal revenues. If costs exceed revenues, the plan can be rejected immediately (“sure, we can make the body of the car out of titanium and be sure it won’t rust, but it would triple the cost of the car and the number of buyers would plummet to basically zilch!”). Reckonings in terms of monetary cost do not uniquely …</p></div></div>

<p>The world has been getting a lot more complex, most people will agree to that. A major element in that rising complexity has been the <a href="https://ea.rna.nl/2020/02/11/a-tipping-point-in-the-information-revolution/">insanely huge amounts of machine logic we human species have been adding to the world</a>. Both that logic itself, as what it enables — think globalisation of trade and communication — has made most of our lives more complex and complicated in one way or another. And while it has brought us much, it also has a serious <a href="https://ea.rna.nl/2020/03/04/gossip-trust-and-the-information-revolution/">number of unwanted side-effects</a>.</p>



<p>We run into the boundaries of our ability to handle that complexity on a daily basis. Be it the large IT projects that invariably run late, cost too much, maybe even straight out fail. Or how we must try to stay secure in a digital world full of brittleness of logic and the weaknesses of humans.</p>



<p>[Note 1: This article is meant to be understandable (with a bit of effort) by non-specialists. There is quite a bit of jargon in it, but I try my best to explain all of it, including a table below with extensive explanation of a number of key terms. If I don’t explain a term, it is safe to ignore it if you don’t know what it is (e.g. when I mention a ‘tomcat server’ as an example), it is helpful for those that know, but not really necessary to know what it is to follow the story]</p>



<p>So, it isn’t a surprise that in IT, a constant drive over the last decennia has been the drive to reduce complexity. <em>‘Reducing complexity’ sells.</em> Especially managers in IT are sensitive to it as complexity generally is their biggest headache. Hence, in IT, people are in a perennial fight to make the complexity bearable. One method that has been popular for decennia has been standardisation and rationalisation of the digital tools we use, a basic “let’s minimise the number of applications we use”. This was actually part 1 of this story: <a href="https://ea.rna.nl/2016/01/10/a-tale-of-application-rationalization-not/">A tale of application rationalisation (not)</a>. That story from 2015 explains how many rationalisation efforts were partly lies. (And while we’re at it: enjoy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2011-01-07" target="_blank">this Dilbert cartoon</a> that is referenced therein.) Most of the time multiple <em>applications</em> were replaced by a single <em>platform</em> (in short: a platform is software that can run other software) and the <em>applications</em> had to be ‘rewritten’ to work ‘inside’ that platform. So you ended up with one <em>extra</em> platform, the <em>same</em> number of applications and generally a few new <em>extra</em> ways of ‘programming’, specific for that platform. That doesn’t mean it is <em>all</em> lies. The new platform is generally dedicated to a certain type of application, which makes programming these applications simpler. But the situation is not as simple as the platform vendors argue. As Frederick Brooks had already told us in 1986: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">There Is No Silver Bullet</a>.</p>



<p>Another drive has been to encapsulate (hide) complexity and access it through simpler interfaces. And a third has been to automate IT itself, creating complex ‘management IT’. All three play a role when we start to outsource IT to cloud services like Microsoft Azure or AWS.</p>



<p>[Note 2: This article has gotten out of hand. Totally. Quite long while I don’t digress a lot — as I often do. But exposing hidden complexity cannot be done without presenting it to you. And not understanding how complex the real IT world is leads to bad outcomes. When the software for supporting the Covid-19 vaccination campaign was a few weeks(!) late because testing wasn’t done yet, I read about a leading politician state something like “Come on, a bit of testing, how hard can it be?”. That is a cringeworthy display of not understanding how complex IT is. And that is partly why I write this. Because until our leaders actually start to understand this, they will create more and more disasters out of ignorance. Back to the story.]</p>



<p>Cloud services have generally been explained (sold) to us with a graphic like this:</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>For non-technical people,  here is a basic explanation of terms used in the above figure and in the text.</p>



<p><span><strong>On Premises</strong></span>: Using your own hardware<br><span><strong>Application</strong></span>: Software that you use, e.g. Microsoft Word.<br><span><strong>Data</strong></span>: The data in your program, say your text in Word.<br><strong><span>Runtime</span>:</strong> Software that is required for other software to run, e.g. basic functionality for Java programs (‘Java runtime’). (Java is a programming language.)<br><span><strong>Middleware</strong></span>: More complex software that is required for other software to run but may also have its own function. E.g. a database.<br><span><strong>Operating System</strong></span>: The lowest layer of software that sits between the machine and all other software. Like Windows or macOS at home.<br><span><strong>Virtualisation</strong></span>: A way to turn one very big real ‘machine’ (computer) into many <em>virtual machines</em> by arranging multiple operating systems to share the big machine. Sharing increases efficiency because not all operating systems are busy at the same time. It also has other advantages.<br><span><strong>Server</strong></span>: The big ‘real’ machine. Like your computer at home but much bigger with multiple processors and lots of memory so it can be shared.<br><span><strong>Storage</strong></span>: Separate machine that is optimised to provide storage (disks), can be used by multiple servers. At home people sometimes have this too in the form of a NAS. These are generally ‘appliances’, that is specialised hardware (in this case with a lot of disks) with specialised software to manage them.<br><span><strong>Networking</strong></span>: Separate machine that enables data traffic between systems. Like your modem, router and Wifi Access Point at home. Again, an appliance with specialised hardware (in this case network interfaces such as wifi antennas and sockets for network cables) that has specialised software to manage these.</p>
</div>



<div>
<p>The suggestion is this: as we move away from our own IT ‘on-premises’ (which includes whatever co-hosting data center you use, in. this context it just means you own your own IT hardware) to more and more in the cloud, we are outsourcing more and more, we are responsible for less, <em>our life simplifies</em>. More cloud is cheaper, simpler and more flexible. What is there not to like?</p>



<p>What there is not to like is that this suggestion is for a large part a lie. And a nasty one.</p>



<p>Take for instance networking. According to the graphic, as soon as you move to the cloud, it’s no longer your responsibility. But that is a lie, except for the rightmost option (SAAS — more about this later). If you set up your IAAS or PAAS in the public cloud — say Microsoft Azure — you have to manage quite a bit of networking. In fact, while Microsoft runs the underlying <em>hardware</em>, much of what has to be managed, will be managed by you. You decide on segmenting, networking, VPNs (virtual private networks — a way to protect traffic between networks), routing firewalls, etc., you’re just using Azure tooling to set it up. It’s easier, but it’s far from all gone.</p>



<p>It is best explained by using an example. Suppose you open up some of your cloud-based systems to access from the public internet? You can do that. And suppose you shouldn’t have, because these systems contain sensitive data? And suppose this data is stolen in a very public breach? Who is to blame? Microsoft for providing you with enough rope to hang yourself, or you? It is clear that if this is a big news story, the heading will not be “Microsoft was lax with its security and management”, but “Company X was lax with its security and management <em>in the cloud</em>“.</p>








</div>
</div>



<p>So, the reality of the situation is therefore more like this:</p>

<p>The hardware — the iron — is indeed something that is completely handled by a cloud provider. This includes things like connecting the server to networks, power, etc., and replacing disk drives, fans, etc. In a fully self-sourced setup this actually turns out to be a limited affair. Most of the work is not hardware these days, it is software. Companies that run their own on-premises data centers don’t have a lot of data center hardware operators. Take the networking engineers. They may lay a few cables to a switch, but after that it is quickly moving to the management console and manage the appliance throughputs management interface — in other words: software work. Networking engineers, storage engineers, and compute engineers alike, their main tool is not a screwdriver, their main tool is a <em>keyboard</em>. Only the basic servers for virtual machines have little in terms of configuration. Networking and storage are <em>appliances</em>, specialised hardware with specialised software. The cloud provider has an interface on top of these that gives you that ‘enough rope to hang yourself with’, i.e. much of this is actually set up and maintained by you. Microsoft doesn’t create or manage your firewall settings, it only offers you an interface to create a virtual firewall running on their appliances and manage that <em>yourself</em>.  So it is a shared responsibility, and especially in networking: you do most of the work in much of the same way you would have to do when you were running your own appliances. Using a firewall in Azure is Microsoft spinning up a virtual appliance for you. And from that moment on, the work is all yours.</p>



<p>The only form of cloud where you really get rid of a lot of responsibility is Software-as-a-Service, or SAAS. That is because SAAS actually simplifies matters… …for the vendor. As explained in the EAPJ article <a href="http://eapj.org/vertical-integration-versus-horizontal-standardisation/">Vertical Integration versus (horizontal) standardisation</a>, the big advantage of SAAS is that the vendor of an application doesn’t need to support a myriad of technical landscapes out there, no myriad of different Linux versions, Java versions, as well as their configurations (security baselines, anyone?), just a single stack they fully manage themselves. That brings a huge standardisation for the vendor, and the advantage of that can be sold (in part) to the customer. Your responsibility is generally limited to a bit of Application tinkering (maybe add plugins, do some configuration) and of course your content. (And even the almost total outsourcing of SAAS is a little lie …</p></div></div>

<p>Have you seen “Aviator”, a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio about Howard Hughes? Then you might recall what an OCD is.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fXF8G50BPQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder">Obsessive–compulsive disorder</a>&nbsp;(OCD) is a&nbsp;mental disorder&nbsp;in which a person has&nbsp;certain thoughts ”repeatedly&nbsp;(called "obsessions") or feels the need to perform&nbsp;certain routines repeatedly&nbsp;(called ”compulsions") to an extent which generates distress or impairs general functioning</strong></p>
<p>I have a mild form of OCD. Had it since teenage years. It rarely bothered me, and I mainly did not care about it much. It manifested itself maybe few times per year, where I would have to re-check if the door is locked few times, for example (which does not seem like a huge burden).</p>
<p>And so, I felt great in autumn and in the first half of December. Everything was fine, I have a job that I love, great family, and hobbies that I enjoy.</p>
<p>Then, this winter came, and It got worse. I live in a northern country (Estonia), daylight time is very short, and although I don’t suffer from SAD too much usually, it might have been a factor. And I usually try to get some vacation in warmer countries, but this year did not do it because of COVID. I also started to work from home, and it probably added to the feeling of isolation and brought me down more.</p>
<p>All in all, I don’t know what were that main factors, but probably the whole combination was just a bit  too much. Occasional obsessions and compulsions started to show up more, but I mainly just shrugged them off. Then, closer to the new year, it stared to get even worse.</p>
<p><strong>And now it’s at a point where I need professional help, It's hard to work, I lost lots of weight, have bad anxiety all the time, and all the obsessions make my behaviour erratic at times.</strong> And yet another problem — its actually hard to find professional help quickly! It can be weeks or months until finding a therapist. Thakfully, I was able to secure an appointment within a weel, but not all people are as lucky.</p>
<p><em>My main mistake was not looking for warning signs of illness.</em> It was “today it’s fine, then all will be fine” attitude, which is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Yes, my case is slightly exotic, but it relates to all other mental health issues: depression, anxiety, panic attacks, etc… <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml">Nearly 20% of people have some form of mental illness</a>, and some of the issues might not seem like a big deal until they hit hard.</p>
<p>As a tale of caution, I have some advice, which I will follow religiously in future. This is relatively obvious and simple, but let my example be a bit of a motivation to take it more seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain mood logging, and journal regularly. It would help to notice any anomalies and problems before they become serious. Don’t shrug off warning signs!</li>
<li>Find mental health checklists, like <a href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety-and-depression-checklist-k10">https://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety-and-depression-checklist-k10</a>, check yourself time from time,</li>
<li>Therapy is important, especially in this times. I never did therapy, and now regret it.</li>
<li>Fitness, meditation, good diet and all kinds of self care — in this time of increased isolation it’s not just some random good habits, treating this seriously is a very important part of well-being.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Polar Vortex collapse sequence has begun in late December 2020, with a major Sudden Stratospheric Warming event on January 5th, 2021. We will look at the sequence of these events, and how they can change the weather in Europe and the United States in the coming weeks.</strong></p>
<p>The main “player” in these weather events, is of course the <strong>Polar Vortex</strong>. It connects the bottom of the atmosphere (our weather) with the stratosphere above it. A strong exchange of energy between these two layers can heavily disrupt the weather development across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<h5><span><strong>WHAT IS THE POLAR VORTEX?</strong></span></h5>
<p>Since knowledge is the key, we will do a quick recap of what exactly is the Polar Vortex.</p>
<p>All of the clouds (and the weather that we feel) are found in the lowest part of the atmosphere called the <span><strong>troposphere</strong></span>. It reaches up to around 8 km (5 miles) altitude over the polar regions and up to around 14-16 km (9-10 miles) over the tropics.</p>
<p>Above it, there is a much deeper layer called the <span><strong>stratosphere</strong></span>. This layer is around 30 km thick and is very dry. We can see the layers of the atmosphere on the image below, with the <span>stratosphere</span> in green hues, and the <span>troposphere</span> in blue at the bottom.</p>

</p>
<p>Every year as we head into autumn, the north pole starts to cool. But the atmosphere further south is still relatively warm as it is still receiving energy from the Sun. The north pole receives very little sunlight and thermal energy, cooling at a faster rate.</p>
<p>The reduction in temperature also means a gradual pressure drop over the north pole. In the stratosphere, the process is the same. As the temperature drops over the pole and the temperature difference towards the south increases, a low-pressure area starts to develop across the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The image below shows a typical example of the Polar Vortex at around 30km altitude (10mb level) in the middle stratosphere.</p>

<p>It is almost like a very large cyclone, covering the whole north pole, down to the mid-latitudes. The polar vortex is present at all levels, almost from the ground up. The image below shows the polar vortex at different altitudes. The closer to the ground we get, the more deformed it gets, due to the complex terrain and the many weather fronts and systems.</p>

<p>We produced a high-resolution video for you below, which very nicely shows the Polar Vortex spinning over the Northern Hemisphere. It covers the period from December 2020 to January 2021, made from NASA GEOS-5 data.</p>
<p>Video shows the 10mb level (30km altitude) potential vorticity parameter, which overly simplified means, that it shows the energy of the polar vortex. Be aware of how the energy is being taken away from the polar vortex by the invisible polar Anticyclones (having a different kind of power), spinning in the opposite direction.</p>


<h5><span><strong>SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
As a general reference, we usually look at the polar vortex in the stratosphere at the 10mb level. That is around 28-32km (17-20 miles) altitude. This is considered to be around the middle stratosphere, and thus a good representation of the general dynamics of the polar vortex.</p>
<p>The strength of the polar vortex is most often measured by the power of the winds inside it. Usually, this is done is by measuring the zonal (west to east) wind speeds around the polar circle (60°N latitude).</p>
<p>Below we have an analysis from the NASA monitoring system, where we can see a very interesting progression. In early December, the polar vortex was at a quite strong level, reaching 40m/s zonal wind speeds. Problems began towards the mid-month, and especially towards late December when the stratospheric warming began. All graphics below are at the 10mb level (~30km altitude).</p>

<p>Below is an image from the video we showed you earlier in the article, and it shows a quite healthy polar vortex in early December. It has a nice shape and a healthy spinning core.</p>

<p>Towards mid-December, the pressure from the North Pacific was rising, with an Anticyclonic presence there gaining strength. The anticyclonic circulation was slowly getting stronger, starting to drain some energy away from the polar vortex, and changing its shape.</p>

<p>By late December, the Pacific/East Asian Anticyclone became quite a force, now draining a lot of energy from the Polar Vortex and actually becoming visible.</p>

<p>At a similar time in late December, a warming sequence began, from Europe over into central Asia. It was starting to engulf the outside layers of the polar vortex. The cold-core of the polar vortex is still rather intact at this point, holding temperatures colder than -80°C in the center over Greenland.</p>

</p>
<p>Just two days later, the warming wave reached a local peak over Siberia, with maximum temperatures in the wave reaching up to +5°C or higher.</p>

</p>
<p>On January 5th, the preliminary date of the Sudden Stratospheric Warming event was marked, as the winds around the polar circle have reversed. We can see how massive and strong the Anticyclone has now become, pushing strongly against the polar vortex (bright white). Together with the warming wave, the strong Anticyclonic system has deformed the once circular polar vortex into a banana-shaped feature.</p>

<p>The warming wave has crawled over the entire North Pole in the stratosphere, effectively splitting the cold-core of the polar vortex into two parts. One over North America and one over the European sector. At this point, this does not have much to do directly with the weather on the surface, as it is at 30km altitude, but we will get to weather effects soon.</p>

<p>Looking quickly at the forecast, we can see that the stratospheric Anticyclone will hold stable and move further over the North Pole. It will continue pushing against the very broken polar vortex.</p>

<p>At this point, a new warming wave is also forecasted to start, which should temporarily prevent any quick reorganization and strengthening of the stratospheric circulation.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the <a href="https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/meteorology/NH.html">NASA</a> temperature analysis for the stratosphere, we can see the large temperature spike at the 10mb (30km) level, which is in the middle stratosphere. The second image shows the temperature analysis in the lower stratosphere at 50mb (20km) level, also having a very clear temperature spike.</p>

<p>Looking even lower, we have the 150mb level, which is kinda the boundary or the “buffer zone” between the stratosphere and the troposphere. Here we can also see the temperature spike, meaning the warming event was fairly robust and fast.</p>

<h5><span><strong>HISTORICAL WEATHER, FOR THE FUTURE</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Before looking closer at the weather forecasts and their relation to the polar vortex, we need to look at some historic examples of similar events. History can sometimes be the best teacher for the future, and in science, this can be true more often than not.</p>
<p>Below we have 2 images, which both are quite simple to read and understand. They show time from left to right, and altitude from bottom to top. Colors show the temperature anomaly, with red being warmer than normal and blue was colder than normal. We can nicely track the progress of stratospheric warming events over time and altitude.</p>

</p>
<p>We can see the progression of warming from the top of the stratosphere, going downwards over time. The first image shows the 2004 stratospheric warming event and the second graphic shows the 2013 event.</p>
<p>The important takeaway is that the warming progresses quite fast down into the troposphere and can start to quickly affect our weather. But it usually stops around 100mb or 150mb level (12-15km). That is normal, due to the fact that we can see a lot of strong weather systems in our troposphere, which can in some cases deflect/reverse any incoming effects from the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Below we have similar two images, but with pressure anomalies instead of temperature. But here you can actually see the connecting points between high pressure coming downwards and the surface layer in the polar region. In both cases, the final effect was seen as individual connections to the bottom levels over time, interfering with the weather development. This indicates that the influence from the Polar Vortex collapse events is periodically interfering with the weather development on a sub-seasonal scale, kinda like waving or resonating.</p>

<p>We don’t yet have the same graphic for 2021, for obvious reasons, since we still need more data to be gathered. But we can look at the forecast data in a similar image below.</p>
<p>What we are seeing is a very similar pattern as in 2004 and 2013. The negative values in this image represent higher pressure. So we can see the descending high-pressure, making individual contacts with the lower layers. This means that the influence is not a constant every time, but rather periodic.</p>

<p>We also decided to look at the weather patterns prior to the 2004 and 2013 events. And we can see in the images below. We can see on the first image for 2004, that the pattern was already positioned for colder weather over Europe, thanks to the strong high-pressure system in the North Atlantic. The United States was generally milder, with southerly flow dominating much of the CONUS.</p>

<p>In 2013, the picture was kinda the opposite. The pattern over the United States was generally colder than in 2004, while Europe was mild to warm even at this point.</p>

<p>This winter, the pattern is kinda a combination of both. We have another cooler/colder episode over Europe like in 2004, thanks to the high-pressure systems in the North Atlantic. At the same time, we also heed a few decent cold episodes over the United States as well.</p>

<p>But after the Polar Vortex breakdown and the stratospheric warming event, the pressure patterns changed quite importantly in 2004 and also in 2013. The image below is the pressure pattern one month after the Polar Vortex collapse in 2004. The strong high pressure in the North Atlantic has been replaced by a strong deep low-pressure system, and the high-pressure has moved into the Arctic …</p></div></div>

<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">This project leverages <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">GitHub Flow</a> for gradually merging changes existing on experimental branches and deployed to experimental environments, towards more mature branches and environments.</p>

<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The <a href="https://github.com/visini/terragrunt-github-actions-aws-ecs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-3d5c50e8="">companion repository</a> contains functionality to deploy code to AWS ECS simply by adopting GitHub Flow principles. All integration and deployment steps are managed by GitHub Actions workflows, including: Unit testing, building and pushing Docker images, and releasing new images to the correct ECS cluster via Terraform and Terragrunt. Create a branch, push, create a pull-request, and, after verifying checks, merge all changes - these are the only steps needed to deploy new features by adopting this approach.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Assuming a running staging and production environment, here's how to deploy changes made for a recent feature "foo" to staging and production environments:</p>

<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">The hierarchical configuration via Terragrunt is enabled by a main configuration file in which all other more granular configuration files are imported. In <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">terragrunt.hcl</code>, both remote state and AWS provider are defined according to values in more specific configuration files.</p>
<p data-v-3d5c50e8="">Both remote state and provider are dynamically defined for each deployment target (e.g., <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">prod</code> vs. <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">stage</code> environment) and AWS account ID (e.g., <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">main</code> vs. <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">secondary</code> account). This means, <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">prod</code> and <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">stage</code> environments (which may even be residing on two separate AWS accounts) adopt separate remote state backend configurations, depending on which environment subfolder <code data-v-3d5c50e8="">terragrunt</code> commands are executed from.

    <p>Nobody here knew quite what a year 2020 was going to be! However despite
pandemics and lockdowns, we have continued to work on Prosody. This post
is a summary of how the project is doing, and what we’ve been up to in
the past year.</p>

<p>One quick note before we begin… Prosody is an independent open-source
project and exists only because the developers have been fortunate enough
to be in a position to work on it. A couple of core team members are
currently looking for freelance work. If you have projects in need of a
Prosody expert, check the bottom of this post for more details!</p>

<h2 id="more-users-than-ever-before">More users than ever before</h2>

<p>Prosody does not “phone home” in any way, which means we do not have a
lot of insight into how many people are using Prosody. But there are
some indicators that we can use to see at least the growth of the project.</p>

<p>Many years ago, circa 2014, I was filling out a form that asked how
many users the project had. I thought long and hard, but with no idea how
to measure, I wrote down an estimate of “500” based on nothing but a gut
feeling. Only a few weeks later I learned that the <a href="https://xmpp.net/">XMPP Observatory</a>
had already seen <strong>over 2200 domains</strong> submitted that were running Prosody.
As most deployments were unlikely to have been submitted to xmpp.net, my
estimate was clearly far out. These days I jump at any chance for even a
vague estimate of our userbase. It helps us to know that people are out
there!</p>

<p>One useful tool is <a href="https://shodan.io/">Shodan</a>. This project scans the
entire internet, just to see what it can find, and it records the results.
Often used by academics and security researchers, a free account can also
be used by anyone to run simple queries over the data they collect.</p>

<p>A Shodan search in 2017 turned up nearly 7000 Prosody deployments. The
same search 8 months later returned over 16000. Today we’re at <strong>over 52000
Prosody servers!</strong> And this only counts instances using port 5269 and
accessible to the internet. There are also many private/internal deployments
of Prosody that are not included in these numbers. Unfortunately we
didn’t run a report in 2019, but here’s a graph of the previous
reports we have run:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.prosody.im/2020-retrospective/prosody-shodan-2020.svg" alt="Graph of Prosody server counts in previous paragraph"></p>

<p>Shodan reports over 85000 federating XMPP servers on port 5269 in total.
Based on this, Prosody makes up 44% of the public XMPP network. That’s
quite an achievement!</p>

<p>Another handy insight into one sector of Prosody deployments is via Debian’s
<a href="https://popcon.debian.org/">“popularity contest”</a> service. This is an
automated survey that administrators of Debian servers can choose to opt
into. It reports anonymously to Debian what software packages are installed
and in use. Although it reflects only a small slice of even Debian
installations, it is useful to see trends.</p>

<p>March 2020 marked an unprecedented spike in Prosody installations!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.prosody.im/2020-retrospective/prosody-popcon-20201231.png" alt="Graph of Debian popularity contest data for prosody"></p>

<p>Although we don’t know for certain, we suspect this was caused by an surge
of interest in the self-hosted video conferencing software, <a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Jitsi Meet integrates with Prosody, which is used to power the
authentication, signaling and chat of the video conferences. Jitsi’s <a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/">Videobridge</a> component handles the media routing. Together they make
a very powerful and flexible communication system, and it is hardly surprising
that interest has spiked this year when there has been a massive shift to
remote work, and online meetings have replaced physical ones.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-2020">Changes in 2020</h3>

<p>In 2020 (looking at the development branch) we added 597 commits, changing
191 files. The changes added 9872 lines of code, and 3637 lines of code
were removed.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the new lines were in our unit and integration
tests (2200 lines, about 22%) which we have been working hard to expand
over the past couple of years.</p>



<p>If you use Prosody, you know we have an emphasis on modularity and
extensibility. We like to make <a href="https://prosody.im/doc/developers/modules">developing plugins for Prosody</a> as easy as possible, whether it’s for integration with other
systems or crazy experiments.</p>

<p>Here’s a random selection of the 363 modules currently in the repository:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_muc_eventsource">mod_muc_eventsource</a></dt>
<dd>Receive messages from MUC rooms with 4 lines of Javascript</dd>
<dt><a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_log_ringbuffer.html">mod_log_ringbuffer</a></dt>
<dd>Send debug logs to RAM unless they are needed.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_component_client">mod_component_client</a></dt>
<dd>Allow a Prosody server to run as a (XEP-0114) external component of
another (Prosody or not) XMPP server.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_firewall">mod_firewall</a></dt>
<dd>Powerful rules-based scripts for filtering and redirecting XMPP traffic.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_minimix">mod_minimix</a></dt>
<dd>An <strong>experiment</strong> in making MUC joins persistent (like MIX).</dd>
</dl>

<p>During 2020 we saw 37 new modules published in the <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/">community repository</a>,
and 499 commits from 19 contributors. Together they added over 10,000
lines of code (and removed 728 lines). This makes it our most active
year apart from 2018!</p>

<p>Outside of the Prosody dev team, the most active contributor was
<a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Severino_Ferrer_de_la_Pe%C3%B1ita_Application_2020">Seve</a>, who also made their first contribution this year and added a total of four new modules.
Welcome aboard!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>But the most important part… what features have we been working on? All
these things are scheduled for the 0.12 release (more on that in a bit).</p>

<h3 id="plugin-installer">Plugin installer</h3>

<p>We have been applying further polish to, and setting up the infrastructure
for the plugin installer. This was a Google Summer of Code project by
<a href="https://gsoc-prosody-2019.blogspot.com/">João Duarte</a>. It utilizes the
Lua package manager, LuaRocks, to download, install and manage community
modules.</p>

<p>Although the the installer was completed in 2019, to make it generally
usable we also had to ensure every module in the <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/">community repository</a>
could be packaged and served in an automated way by our server. We now
have this working.</p>

<h3 id="bye-bye-telnet-hello-prosodyctl-shell">Bye bye telnet, hello prosodyctl shell!</h3>

<p>The telnet console is one of the best things about Prosody, and we’ve
been working on its successor. An early version of <code>prosodyctl shell</code> is
already available to try out in trunk nightly builds.</p>

<p>Using prosodyctl allows us to more easily support advanced features such
as line editing and history (previously attainable using a third-party
utility, rlwrap). It also allows for some richer UIs and is more secure
on shared servers (it uses a unix socket instead of TCP).</p>

<h3 id="dns-improvements">DNS improvements</h3>

<p>Since Prosody needs to resolve special DNS record types (such as SRV
records) and in an asynchronous manner, the built-in operating system APIs
are generally inadequate.</p>

<p>For a long time we’ve been using an adopted library simply known as
‘dns.lua’ combined with our own asynchronous wrapper around it. Although
it hasn’t been terrible, it has a few issues, especially in some uncommon
environments. It also doesn’t support many advanced features such as DNSSEC.</p>

<p>Now we are migrating to libunbound, part of the <a href="https://github.com/coredns/unbound">unbound</a>
project. This is one of the leading DNS implementations, and will be a
big improvement over our current DNS library. To try it out, you can
simply install <a href="https://www.zash.se/luaunbound.html">luaunbound</a> (already
available in luarocks, Debian testing, AUR and others - poke your distro
maintainers if you don’t have it yet!).</p>

<h3 id="http-server-upload-performance">HTTP server upload performance</h3>

<p>We didn’t set out to write a HTTP server, but we ended up with one anyway!
Originally added so that we could natively support BOSH (XMPP over HTTP)
clients, it grew to support websockets, and various modules now provide
HTTP APIs for integration between Prosody and other systems.</p>

<p>One big problem is that the original implementation was designed for only
small amounts of data. Since the widespread of adoption of
<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html">XEP-0363</a> people now want to
be able to upload files, pictures and videos using Prosody’s internal
HTTP server. We have limits in place to protect against denial of service
attacks, but those same limits prevent large uploads from trusted users.</p>

<p>We’ve put some work into supporting “streaming uploads”, where incoming
data can be saved directly to disk instead of RAM. This means it will be
safe to increase file upload limits without opening up your server to
increase RAM usage and denial of service attacks.</p>

<p>In general though, we do recommend using a real external HTTP server in
a production or high traffic deployment (using <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload_external">mod_http_upload_external</a>).</p>

<h3 id="beyond-passwords">Beyond passwords</h3>

<p>Passwords are the fundamental means of authenticating to your server in
XMPP today. XMPP is quite good at this, adopting strong standard authentication
mechanisms such as SCRAM far earlier than the rest of the industry. But
the rest of the industry is also moving away from passwords in many places.
We’re aiming to follow this movement also. Not that we are scrapping passwords
entirely, but making it easier to offer alternatives.</p>

<p>Prosody actually has a number of non-password authentication modules already,
such as <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_oauthbearer">mod_auth_oauthbearer</a> (OAuth2 tokens),
 <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_ccert">mod_auth_ccert</a> (client certificates) and
 <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_token">mod_auth_token</a> (HMAC-based
 tokens).
But most of the modules have limitations and are not well integrated
(e.g. you can set up Prosody to accept passwords, or set it up to accept
tokens, but you can’t offer both methods at the same time).</p>

<p>An important related aspect is authorization. In most systems authentication
via a token also provides <em>limited access to the account</em> (e.g. if a password
is associated with an account, a session that logged in using a token
should not be allowed to reset the password).</p>

<p>We’ve been working on two things. Firstly, a built-in authorization system
(more flexible than the current <code>admins</code> configuration option) where users
and sessions can be associated with specific permissions and roles.</p>

<p>Secondly we’re using this authorization layer to add built-in support
for OAuth2-style authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>This is exciting for a number of reasons. It will allow, for example,
specialized clients to request and receive (when granted by the user)
limited …</p></div></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>Sometimes it can take years to make a single-line code change.</p>

<p>As engineering organizations grow, the problems and their solutions become more intricate. What might have taken an afternoon now takes months of coordinated effort. The system (both the technology and the people) are larger, more complex, and more difficult to change than ever before.</p>

<p>But change is necessary.</p>

<p>We might be looking to pay off some technical debt or tee up an architectural change to unlock a better customer experience, cost savings, etc. What is a tool we can use to coordinate many groups of people, hold groups accountable, and eventually succeed?</p>

<p>Enter what I call the <strong>Campaign</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="elements-of-a-campaign">Elements of a Campaign</h2>

<p>A Campaign is a long-running effort to enact global change safely within a sociotechnical system.</p>

<p><strong>Every campaign needs the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A Goal</li>
  <li>Metrics toward that goal</li>
  <li>Buy-in</li>
  <li>Method of Accountability</li>
  <li>A “Window”</li>
  <li>A Target Date</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Campaigns work well to address:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical changes with large social components.</li>
  <li>Technical changes that require everyone to do a little bit of work.</li>
  <li>High-value or inevitable future worlds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Campaigns don’t work with:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Efforts that avoid measurement, or where measurement is likely actively harmful. Examples include “We should improve the design of our code.”</li>
  <li>Organizations that cannot buy-in to the effort for one reason or another.</li>
  <li>Low-value Campaigns. No need to coordinate many teams if efforts can be localized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many campaigns have a trivial technical goal. My favorite example: The request timeout value is likely one line in a configuration file. Safely changing that to a lower value can be months of work.</p>

<p>Let’s step through the individal components in greater detail.</p>

<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal</h2>

<p>Every campaign needs a goal that can be expressed in a single sentence. The goal should be separate from the metric. It may or may not include implementation details. I usually recommend they include some hint of implementation so that the scope of effort can be limited a bit.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“We want to improve the resiliency and throughput of our background processes by making all jobs idempotent.”</li>
  <li>“We want to improve the customer experience and resiliency of our system by limiting the amount of time a web request can take.”</li>
  <li>“We want to improve the health of our database by enforcing a timeout on all queries.”</li>
</ul>

<p>If the goal feels a bit too open, consider adding non-goals as well to keep the effort focused.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-impact">Focus on Impact</h2>

<p>Before beginning a Campaign, you need to convice a lot of people that this is a valuable effort and that now is the right time to tackle such an effort. A crisp articulation of “Why this Campaign?” and “Why now?” is required.</p>

<p>Write these down, but expect to repeat them in other media often.</p>

<p>Focus on the benefits of achieving the goal. The more we can ground the impact in objective truths (e.g. “our system is more resilient to failure”) and less in personal preference for technology (e.g. “we were using Tech X but now we use Tech Y”), the better.</p>

<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>

<p>Every Campaign needs a metric or two to enable tracking progress and accountability.</p>

<p>Each metric should be able to be assigned to a given team or individual. Once the metrics go green, we should have <em>ipso facto</em> achieved our goal.<sup id="fnref:okrs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:okrs">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Choosing a metric can be difficult. It should not be succeptible to <a href="https://brownfield.dev/post/2020-02-18-trap-rule-beating/">Rule Beating</a>, where the metric will be green but the intent of the goal will be missed.</p>

<p>Metrics need to be incremental and as fine-grained as necessary. We should see the slow march of progress, rather than a sudden “Okay, we’re done!”</p>

<p>There should be many ways to achieve a metric. In the example of global request timeouts, we can hit that timeout by reducing the total number of database queries, speeding up serialization of JSON, caching, loading less data, etc.</p>

<p>A few examples derived from the above examples goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of background jobs that are not idempotent.</li>
  <li>Endpoints that are over the threshold of request length.</li>
  <li>Database queries that are over the threshold of query length.</li>
</ul>

<p>Metrics should be easy to grok and able to be sliced a few different ways. In our request threshold example, we might want to surface both “number of endpoints remaining” and “total percentage of endpoints.”</p>

<h2 id="buy-in">Buy-in</h2>

<p>A Campaign by definition reaches across the organization and touches many teams. Every team, mission, individual, and sub-org has different priorities and different worries.</p>

<p>For a Campaign to be successful, it needs global participation of those involved. Buy-in will look different in different organizations, but will generally be a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick">Carrot and Stick</a> (choosing to do something vs. being coerced to do something).</p>

<p>Leading with the benefits (i.e. the Carrot) can go a long way here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If we are able to make jobs idempotent, the Infrastructure team can take over responsibility of background jobs and reduce costs by 90%.”</li>
  <li>“If we are able to make all requests take less than 2 seconds, the customer experience will improve and we will be able to reduce costs.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The benefits may not be convincing enough or still might not meet the priority threshold for some teams. If many teams do not find the benefits convincing enough, you might not have a Campaign worth pursuing.</p>

<h2 id="a-method-of-holding-teams-accountable">A Method of Holding Teams Accountable</h2>

<p>How much further do we have to go? Where might we need to invest more?</p>

<p>Most Campaigns will have a central place to answer questions like these. Speadsheets here work just fine. Dashboards are even better. They might be automatically populated or populated by hand, usually with the help of a script. Whatever it is, it should quickly answer a few questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How far along are we?</li>
  <li>Which teams are doing well? (We should follow up with these teams to see what’s working for them.)</li>
  <li>Which teams are falling behind? (We should follow up with these team to see if they need more help, resources, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be passively available, but also circulated on some regular cadence. Weekly, monthly, or quarterly, everyone involved should get an update in their inbox.</p>

<h2 id="a-window">A “Window”</h2>

<p>The Window is a method of prioritizing work to be done while ensuring that progress is permanent. It moves. It is optional but helpful in most Campaigns.</p>

<p>A Window usually defines two threshold: Warning and Not Allowed. In a Campaign to enforce a global request timeout, here’s how the Window might look at the start and evolve:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Goal is to make no web request take longer than 5 seconds, 99.9% of the time.</li>
  <li>The Window is set to Warn: 30 seconds, Not Allowed: 60 seconds. 60 seconds is the current limit set by our load balancer and the behavior that exists today.</li>
  <li>Teams tackle all requests that fall between Warn and Not Allowed until there are no more in the Window.</li>
  <li>We move the Window down to Warn: 15 seconds, Not Allowed: 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>GOTO Step 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using this approach yields a few benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organizers of the campaign provide a default prioritization approach. Team do not have to develop their own.</li>
  <li>By setting and enforcing “Not Allowed,” we ensure that progress is permanent. A team cannot introduce a new request that takes longer than a given amount of time.</li>
  <li>Teams are warned in advance of a future change. They might receive a weekly email report, an exception, or a Slack message notifying them of something that is okay today but not okay in the future.</li>
  <li>Incremental value is delivered. If we stop the Campaign for whatever reason, lasting value will remain.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-example-global-request-timeouts">An Example: Global Request Timeouts</h2>

<p>I’ve threaded an example throughout this post, but let’s look at a specific example compiled together.</p>

<p>One that I’ve seen in a few organizations is the need to set and/or reduce the total amount of time a web request can take. This is the type of thing that can be easy to ignore, especially in applications serving industries with high switching costs or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem">Principal-agent problem</a>. (High switching costs or principle-agent problem mean a slow degredation of performance will never bubble up as a priority.) Many Campaigns take the form of “If we knew to have this limit in the first place, this would be a lot easier.”</p>

<p>Let’s put it all together.</p>

<div>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>

<p>We want to improve the customer experience and resiliency of our system by limiting the amount of time a request can take.</p>

<p>We want to eventually get to 2 seconds for the 99th percentile of requests, with a hard cutoff of 5 seconds.</p>

<p>We talk more about this Goal, why it was chosen, and it’s urgency in <em>this longer document</em>. (Link to something convincing.)</p>

<p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Number of endpoints not adhering to the Goal.</li>
<li>Number of endpoints within the Window.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Window:</strong></p>

<p>At the start, we’ll set the Window to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warn: 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Not Allowed: 60 seconds (this is the current timeout setting).</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, we’ll look to increment the Warn threshold by 15 seconds, or N/2 each time.</p>

<p><strong>Campaign Manager:</strong></p>

<p>Jane Smith will be in charge of tracking progress and reporting on this Campaign.</p>

<p>Jane and Team X will be available to help teams get their requests to the goal. Team X is also responsible for unowned code in the system.</p>

<p><strong>Target Date:</strong></p>

<p>We’d like to be complete with this effort on January 1, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post is a generalization of an effort I find myself doing more and more at Gusto. Every campaign is a little bit different, and needs to be adapted accordingly.</p>

<p>Hopefully this framework helps you and your teams make complicated technical changes that require large-scale behavioral or process changes.</p>

  <article>
    <p>One of the many upsides I’ve had from working at lots of organisations
is that you get to see what’s common. Are things like this everywhere?
Frequently, the answer is yes!</p>

<p>An example of this is tech debt.</p>

<p>I see organisations which are running to stand still, and I’m not
sure they realised they’re doing that.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this?</p>

<p>Every time you decide to solve a problem with code, you are committing
part of your future capacity to maintaining and operating that code.
Software is never done.</p>

<p>Here’s a few examples of demonstrating what I mean:</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You write a networked service to solve a business problem. Say
it has an HTML web UI</li>
  <li>It has no known security issues</li>
  <li>Time passes</li>
  <li>You now have security issues with your code, and you should assess
 whether you need to do work to address these.</li>
</ol>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>Humans are terri-bad at writing secure code. And given enough time,
other humans will discover the security holes in your service.</p>

<p>This applies both to code your organisation writes, and the libraries
they use, or the operating systems, or web servers, or …</p>

<h3 id="security-examples">Security Examples</h3>

<p>Take your pick from browsing a CVE database, or use
<a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> or similar to look at your current codebases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TLS / SSL issues:

</ul>

<h3 id="legislation">Legislation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You write a networked service to solve a business problem. Say
 it has an HTML web UI</li>
  <li>It has no known legal compliance issues</li>
  <li>Time passes</li>
  <li>You now have legal compliance issues with your code, and you should
 assess whether you need to do work to address these.</li>
</ol>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>
addressed organisations not handling data very well.</p>

<p>Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations – mostly known
for mandating cookie policy.</p>

<p>The Equality Act 2010 (UK) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
1990 (2010 update) for website accessibility. Yes, there was a time
when people didn’t consider accessibility when building web sites.</p>

<p>Brexit has meant a lot of changes for businesses in the EU and UK.
Software has been rewritten to manage the new trading relationships.
This will continue to happen for a while countries establish new
relationships.</p>

<h3 id="3rd-parties">3rd parties</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You write a service to solve a business problem</li>
  <li>You can build and release it when necessary</li>
  <li>Time passes</li>
  <li>You are now unable to build and release the service</li>
</ol>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>3rd parties will change their APIs, or how things work. They may
do this for any number of reasons: performance, or security among
them. Older versions become deprecated, and unsupported. And these
older versions will still have new security issues reported against
them. So you need to upgrade, and adapt your code to use the new
API.</p>

<p>People building code libraries will strive to maintain backward
compatibility. But we still get <a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a> major
version changes, and breaking API changes.</p>

<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>

<p>Most software needs constant maintenance. Building and operating
software has a cost which you should always factor in when deciding
to solve problems in that way.</p>

<p>A team working in a particular way can only be responsible for a
fixed amount of software. The amount of software should be managed,
otherwise the team will grind to a halt.</p>

<h2 id="proposition">Proposition</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A team working in a particular way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if we change how they work?</p>

<p>Well yes, there are options there.</p>

<p>I’ve got a separate post (currently brewing) about Dunbar’s numbers,
but for this post, different sized organisations might have different
options. At a certain size, it makes sense to have people dedicated
to developer productivity and creating tools which improve the
capacity of other teams.</p>

<p>You can choose higher-level languages, and use technology stacks
from SaaS vendors which need less time from your people.</p>

<p>There is one option I had planned to spend researching last year
(but I ended up getting a job instead). This feels like potentially
a big market. I’ve seen lots of organisations with decade-old
codebases which are still running unsupported versions of dependencies
or frameworks.</p>

<p>As a developer, I’m familiar with a hammer, and was curious if I
could use it.</p>

<p>Can we have tooling that automates keeping software up-to-date?</p>

<p>I see this problem in every organisation I’ve ever worked in, with
all aspects.</p>

<p>Web applications/APIs written in any language. As mentioned above,
there are many reasons that software rots if left unattended. Mobile
apps also have this. Migrating versions of Android, or iOS, or …</p>

<p>Configuration/manifests for Infrastructure as Code aslo suffer from
this. Terraform hasn’t yet released 1.x, but there have been many
changes over the years. If you’re using Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes,
you’ll <a href="https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble">have experienced
changes</a> which mean
you need to do work.</p>

<p>Automating the changes needed in YAML for upgrading from Kubernetes
<code>n</code> to <code>n+1</code> feels like a widely useful tool.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>

<p>There are some commercial things which do related work.</p>

<p>Snyk, <a href="https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate">Renovate</a>,
<a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a> and other things exist which
can make pull requests to update dependencies. Mpost languages have
a package tool and bumping numbers is pretty straightforward. These
things tend to not be able to manage breaking API changes though.
Bumping a patch or minor dependency upgrade is fine, but a major
one with breaking API changes tends to need a human to get involved.</p>

<p>Why? Could we have a tool that solves this? When a new version of
<a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> is released, could it include an
accompanying set of transformations which will allow the entire
ecosystem to safely and rapidly upgrade?</p>

<p>Having a minor interest in compilers (and having worked on a
commercial interpreter), I tend to think of code editing operations
as transformations, rather than characters. There’s been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/prune-a-code-editor-that-is-not-a-text-editor/1012061842160013">some
research in transformation-based
editors</a>,
but I’ve not seen a lot else.</p>

<p>Major version upgrades could potentially be similarly expressed in
terms of transformations, which similarly might be composed. So if
a class has been removed between major versions of a dependency,
the required transformation might be composed of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Insert new class <code>my.Y</code></li>
  <li>Implement interface <code>spring.new.Z</code></li>
  <li>Adapt method <code>A</code> from old class <code>my.Z</code> onto method <code>B</code> in new
 class <code>my.Y</code></li>
  <li>Adapt parameters from adapted method – a <code>Context</code>
 used to be obtained from <code>ApplicationSingleton</code> but is now passed
 in explicity</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ol>

<p>And then you would need a serialisation format and publishing
mechanism for these sets of transformations.</p>

<p>The closest I’ve seen to this is where Google actually did that in
the same target langauge. They <a href="https://blog.golang.org/introducing-gofix">published a tool with for the
language Go</a>, named
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/fix/"><code>fix</code></a>. It automated upgrades of
existing code before 1.x was released, and since then, they’ve had
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">the Go 1 compatibility document</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, <code>fix</code> appears to have been mostly inactive since then?</p>

<p>I’m interested (academically as well as commercially) in producing
a tool which looked something similar, but much more widely applicable.</p>

<p>So having something that can take code/configuration, generate an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and then apply a set of transformations.
Transformations compose. A large one might be <strong>Upgrade Framework
<code>n</code> to <code>n+1</code></strong> involvings lots of smaller transformations. For each
transformation, you’d need to query the AST for usages of the old

It’s seems like a big market – how many companies would pay for you

        <p><span>M</span>erpeopleâ€™s hybridity has helped them maintain a presence in both scientific and mythological camps. In many peopleâ€™s minds, mermaids and mermen remain mythical creatures more suitable for bedtime stories than scientific tracts. Yet for others merpeople symbolize the outer limits of our scientific and mythological investigations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as the evolution of science has not done away with lingering notions of wonder and myth, so too has our innate need to push boundaries of knowledge led humanity into strange—often mind-blowing—frontiers of research and self-reflection. Humanityâ€™s interaction with merpeople demonstrates our ongoing need for discovery as much as our attempts at regulation and classification. Like the hybrid monstrosities with which humankind has always grappled, humanity maintains a tenuous balance between wonder and order, civilization and savagery.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere is this fragile equilibrium more obvious than in the early Christian Churchâ€™s myriad representations of mermaids and tritons. Murky ideologies of mermaids and mermen originated in ancient gods and goddesses of the sea; although mermaids now rule as the more popular of the two, merpeopleâ€™s predominance began with mermen. The Babylonians had their fish-god Oannes dating back to 5,000 BCE, while the Philistines, Assyrians and Israelites created the â€˜female prototypeâ€™ for the mermaid with Atargatis, a fertility goddess who was the female counterpart to Oannes. Importantly, Atargatis also symbolized the danger of love and lust, an association which Christians would later embrace wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>A spate of pagan representations of merpeople followed Oannes and Atargatis, ranging from Greek and Roman depictions of Aphrodite and Venus, respectively, to Pliny the Elderâ€™s descriptions of mysterious human-fish sea creatures in 80 CE, to the Greeksâ€™ incorporation of Triton (the origin for the merman) and his wife Amphitrite, to Odysseusâ€™ fateful encounter with the harpies (airborne daughters of sea-goddesses) on his famous voyage. Oddly, harpies and the Greek â€˜Scyllaâ€™—hybrid monstrosities with little resemblance to half-fish, half-women mermaids—would ultimately spawn modern interpretations of mermaids. Over time, artists and writers took the helm in transforming the monstrous representations of Scylla and Homerâ€™s harpies into our modern interpretations of mermaids, replete with sexual overtones, siren songs and the overtly feminine (often naked) form. Thus, while mermen found their origins in a Greek god, mermaids largely originated from hideous beasts who only intended to bring man to destruction through his own lust for sex and power. As would be demonstrated by the early Christian Church, such connotations of sex, lust and power were no coincidence.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_1dc26359e27a167f1bd1825f1abacd2e.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-07 at 2.19.08 AM"><figcaption><span>â€˜Derceto [or Atargatis] Dominating the Seaâ€™, from Athanasius Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652). </span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beginning in the third to fifth centuries CE, Church leaders simultaneously adopted, transformed and harnessed ancient pagan symbols of merpeople to assert notions of piety, faith and self- control. Although mermen had long been associated with rape and violence, the early Christian Church was on a mission to dethrone femininity, and had little use for these male monstrosities. Rather, churchmen hoped to transform notions of the Homerian harpy to fit their own means, and in doing so adopted more sexual connotations and imagery in their representations of mermaids.<br></p>
<p>Physical representations of merpeople were critical to this process. Our modern conception of the mermaid stems directly from early churchmenâ€™s depictions of these mysterious creatures. Traditionally shown as human females above the waist, with long, flowing hair and bare breasts, a mirror in one hand and a comb in the other, these half-women, half-fish served as ideal symbols of wonder and danger for Church leaders. Beyond utilizing such â€˜monstersâ€™ to demonstrate Godâ€™s ability to â€˜alter his own laws of natureâ€™, churchmen especially adopted these pagan creatures in an effort to depreciate the feminine—hence the overtly sexual representation of mermaids in church carvings, bestiaries, illuminated texts and artwork. Nakedness—especially as a vehicle for sexual lust—was rare in early Christian and medieval art. Thus, as topless women (who also boasted scaly fish-tails), mermaids would have harnessed a shock factor through image alone.</p>
<blockquote>Church leaders simultaneously adopted, transformed and harnessed ancient pagan symbols of merpeople.</blockquote>

<p>Oftentimes, in fact, church sculptors portrayed mermaids â€˜spreadingâ€™ their tails apart, thereby exposing their reproductive area—or <em>vesica piscis</em> (Latin for â€˜vessel of the fishâ€™)—in graphic detail. A mermaidâ€™s accessories also revealed deeper symbolism, with her mirror and comb representing vanity (not to mention the duality of oneâ€™s soul outside the body) and her flowing hair signifying fertility. Sometimes, mermaids would hold a fish instead of a comb, which probably further symbolized her link to the fish as an early symbol of Christianity. By the medieval period (the fifth to fifteenth centuries CE), churchgoers throughout Europe worshipped in spaces decorated with overtly sexualized mermaid imagery. Church leaders, meanwhile, cultivated an intimate knowledge of these strange creatures through myriad texts, art and sculpture. Such ubiquity helped to facilitate general acceptance of, and belief in, mermaids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In symbolism used by the early Christian Church, mermen were not as popular as mermaids. When mermen occasionally appeared in church carvings, they were almost always paired with mermaids. This representation correlated with early Christian and medieval imagery—especially cultivated in illuminated texts and bestiaries—which generally depicted mermen as partners of mermaids. Mermaids were much more likely to appear alone than were mermen. In contrast to the beautiful (and dangerous) female form of the mermaid, moreover, authors and illustrators represented mermen either as ugly creatures intended to oppose the mermaidâ€™s striking femininity and sexuality, or as symbolic of Christian piety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, mermaids—hybrid creatures of myth and lore—symbolized the early Christian Churchâ€™s willingness to hybridize itself (that is, embrace a mix of pagan and Christian belief systems) in its larger attempts to cultivate the largest following possible. Here, the Christian Church deliberately adopted and adapted pagan symbols in its holy spaces, thereby bridging the gap between the supposedly â€˜savageâ€™ and the civilized; the past and the present. And it largely worked, as Christian doctrine steadily decentered symbols of the sacred feminine by the medieval period. However, such efforts had unexpected side effects, as by utilizing these hybrid monstrosities to support religious tenets the Christian Church legitimatized such creatures, which in turn created the foundation for belief and acceptance for generations to come.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>The â€˜Age of Discoveryâ€™ (roughly 1500 to 1700 CE) only solidified Westernersâ€™ long-standing beliefs and cultural traditions surrounding merpeople. By 1492 Westerners had long lived in a world of merpeople: especially in wealthy, sea-faring societies like Venice or Genoa, merpeople became almost ubiquitous mainstays of art, ranging from tombs to tomes, sculptures to tableware. Unsurprisingly, by the time Westerners pushed further east and west into what were, for them, uncharted territories, they fully expected to find mermaids and tritons. They had, after all, lived their lives surrounded by these mysterious creatures. Importantly, before the â€˜Age of Discoveryâ€™, Europeans placed Jerusalem in the centre of the globe in terms of religious tradition. The further one got from Jerusalem, the stranger and more dangerous the world became. If merpeople lived anywhere, many early modern Westerners believed, it must be at the ends of the Earth, where monstrosities and curiosities thrived.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>The&nbsp;â€˜Age of Discoveryâ€™&nbsp;only solidified Westernersâ€™&nbsp;long-standing beliefs surrounding merpeople.<br></blockquote>
<p>As Westerners heightened their interactions with the Pacific and Atlantic worlds in a search for monetary, religious and imperial power, recorded sightings of merpeople multiplied exponentially. The Atlantic Ocean and its â€˜New Worldâ€™ shores were especially rife with such interactions, as famed explorers integrated merpeople into their understandings of strange—and potentially lucrative—environments. Yet, where in the medieval period interactions with mermaids and tritons usually uncovered a deeper lesson over lust, vanity or religion, early modern explorers transformed such contact beyond manifestations of the Christian creed and instead began to reflect in their â€˜mer-sightingsâ€™ emerging notions of exploration, growth and national prowess. Each Western country had its own stories of merpeople, and in each of these interactions the nation tried to assert its understanding of the globe. Monstrosities abounded in the New World, and Europeans were intent on uncovering their secrets. This was a period of legitimization for merpeople.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As sightings proliferated and European Christians steadily colonized the Americas, Western mapmakers began in earnest to chart these strange new worlds. Of course, such cartographic creations were as much about Europeâ€™s effort to position itself as a world power as they were about accurately recreating the New World topography. These maps were also, importantly, intended to demonstrate the exotic opportunity of the world, while also shrinking its size to suit Europeansâ€™ imperialist efforts. Therefore â€˜strangeâ€™ or â€˜foreignâ€™ lands like the Americas and the â€˜Far Eastâ€™ were often depicted with merpeople in their surrounding seas.This was no mistake, nor can it be boiled down to a temporary flight of fancy. Mapmakers intentionally included merpeople …</p></article></div>

The information in this paper is based on research done by Frances Brown
under my supervision; many of the ideas in it are hers, and many come from
collaborative discussion. The paper was originally given at the Criminalistic
Institute in Prague, and was written to be presented there. 

<p>


<strong>1. Introduction and theoretical base.</strong>This paper reports on a project that was undertaken in 1982-3,
funded by the Home Office. It came from the fact that while document examiners
in the UK know a great deal about what the handwriting of UK citizens is
like, and know in general terms how that handwriting was learned, they in
fact know very little about the way in which the learning of handwriting
actually goes on in schools. So the project began with a very general remit:
to investigate the way in which handwriting is taught and learned in the
UK. What it turned into was an investigation into the whole issue of the
relationship between the taught style of handwriting and the way in which
that handwriting is actually done.</p><p>

It was clear from the outset that there are two sources from which handwriting
is learned: from copybooks, and from teachers. The investigation thus split
into two: we used surveys and sampling investigation to find out how handwriting
is actually taught in schools, and we conducted an extensive examination
and analysis of a large sample of the copybooks used in the UK in the lifetime
of any contemporary adult. </p><p>

In general what the project showed was this. Handwriting of UK citizens
is, compared with that of those educated elsewhere in Europe or in America,
very various. No uniformity is imposed centrally, at the governmental level,
or locally, by Local Educational Authorities. There are several different
handwriting systems to be found in the available copybooks, and each copybook
may present its own version of the system it derives from. Individual schools
may favour particular systems or particular copybooks, but often it is left
to the individual teacher of handwriting to adopt whatever method they feel
comfortable with. Moreover, even at the beginning of learning to write it
is not usually expected or demanded that the child should faithfully copy
the learned system, and, later in life, it is common for teenagers who to
change their writing style to make it look beautiful. This is true for both
boys and girls, but the evidence is that girls spend a lot more time at
it. In fact handwriting that follows a copybook style closely is commonly
seen as 'immature', or 'naive', or 'lacking in personality'; and idiosyncratic
or unusual or even messy handwriting is seen as showing valuable personality
traits: individuality, creativity, and so on. As a result, the handwriting
of mature adults can vary considerably from the learned system, containing
a mixture of elements deriving from any combination of (1) the system itself,
(2) the particular copybook version of that system, (3) a school-teacher's
version of the copybook, (4) the individual's own idiosyncratic variation,
and (5) curious features that occur in no copybook but are nonetheless commonly
found, presumably having spread through the culture by some form of osmosis.
This means that when someone says: 'how would you characterize the handwriting
of the UK?' they are asking a question that is very hard to answer; in fact,
it is a question that no-one <cite>could</cite> answer before this project
was undertaken.</p><p>

So: the situation that we discovered is complex, but it is not chaotic.
General patterns were discovered, and interesting sub-patterns. Before giving
the detail of the findings, however, it is necessary to establish some terminology.</p><center><a href="http://www.unask.com/website/handwriting/new_web_pages/terms.htm"><strong>Summary of Terminology</strong></a>
</center>
<div><p>Handwriting in the UK is learned at school, usually beginning at the
age of 5 or so, by copying. What is copied is a formal <strong>system. </strong>We
discovered from a close analysis of some 50 handwriting copybooks, which
we believe represent all of the published styles available in the lifetime
of any adult, that their apparent diversity can be reduced to four basic
systems: <strong>Print Script, Round Hand, Looped Cursive, </strong>and<strong>
Italic.</strong> However the actual version of the system that the child
copies will normally come from a particular copybook, which may have its
own variation or dialect of the basic system; or what a child actually copies
may be work materials prepared by a teacher, with the teacher's own variations
added. If a child moves from one school or even one teacher to another,
he or she may be exposed to two different copybooks or even two different
systems. Nonetheless, it is usually possible to detect traces of the system,
though not the actual copy book version of it, that a given person has been
taught.</p><p>

By repeated attempts to copy this basic pattern the child learns the necessary
skills of motor-co-ordination. The child first learns Print Script, a simple
unjoined alphabet, and then learns a joined style based one of the other
three main systems. As the mature hand develops, eventually by the end of
the teenage years evolving into the stable final hand that will (usually)
serve the individual for the rest of his or her life, two kinds of characteristic
can be ascertained. We call these <strong>individual characteristics</strong>
and <strong>style characteristics</strong> . Individual characteristics
are those components of a given hand that make it unique: they are what
document examiners are mainly interested in. But in each hand there will
also be a residual set of style characteristics: those elements which are
shared with other members of a group or groups. Style characteristics come
in three kinds: <strong>system characteristics</strong> , that serve to
identify which of the four general classes or systems the learned style
derives from; <strong>copybook characteristics</strong> , that can definitely
be linked to a particular copybook version of the basic system; and, finally,
what we call <strong>underground characteristics</strong> , which are those
features which are shared with other writers, but which do not occur in
any copybook. So for example the following letter-forms, familiar to all
UK handwriting examiners, are not as far as we know part of any of the basic
systems or their copybook dialects:</p></div><center><a href="http://www.unask.com/website/handwriting/new_web_pages/underground.htm"><strong>Underground characteristics</strong></a><strong>.</strong>
</center>
<div><p>Some underground characteristics may actually be learned at the stage
when handwriting is initially acquired, deriving from the practice of teachers
who modify the copybook system that they teach, for whatever reason, thus
incorporating underground characteristics at this early stage. Normally,
however, they seem to be picked up later, presumably by imitation.</p><p>

Since in the UK (and in other countries too) the normal process of teaching
handwriting is to teach first one system, the unjoined Print Script, and
then a second, cursive or joined up system, it is the latter that normally
is the basis of the set of system characteristics in the mature hand. Rather
confusingly, however, the original Print Script is not seen as being a system
at all, but as 'basic writing', which is then 'joined up', under the influence
of some taught system, to form a cursive style. In fact what happens is
that two successive <cite>systems</cite> are learned, the latter superseding
the former: Print Script is as much a copybook system, with a history and
a designer, as any other. But because of the misconception that Print Script
is not a system, this form is not often seen in adult handwriting. It is
widely associated with semi-literacy, where the writer is assumed not to
have progressed on to the 'joined up' writing.</p><p>

The case of capitals is also curious. The child learns two forms: Print
Script is taught in a lower and upper case form. The cursive scripts that
follow it also have their own particular kind of capitals, and these are
learned; but they are only used when the writer is doing their normal writing.
When an adult is required to fill in a form and asked to write in capitals
for the purpose of clarity, they will usually produce Print Script capitals.
(The practice found elsewhere in Europe of producing a print script lower
case form when asked to write clearly--to 'print'--is rare in the UK.) These
Print Script capitals are known as <strong>block capitals</strong> , and
considered (incorrectly) to be a separate style: they are not associated
in most people's minds with the 'childish' style of Print Script. Since
for most people filling in forms is only a small part of the writing that
they do, block capitals are not much practiced and therefore retain quite
purely their Print Script style: they are less embellished than cursive
writing with individual or underground characteristics. Therefore block
capitals are commonly used in writing that wishes to remain anonymous. However,
some writers have more practice than others in writing block capitals, and
they have evolved styles of their own. All of these styles are underground:
no style of block capitals other than Print Script is taught or published.</p></div><center><a href="http://www.unask.com/website/handwriting/new_web_pages/caps.htm"><strong>Styled Block Capitals</strong> </a></center>
<div><p>As far as document examiners are concerned the relevance of this outline
of handwriting acquisition is as follows. The part of their job that concerns
handwriting examination can be said to have two aspects: <strong>identification</strong>
and <strong>categorization</strong> . Identification deals with those tasks
that involve stating whether or not a particular piece of writing was, or
was not, written by a particular individual. Categorization deals with the
problem of anonymous writing, and involves saying whatever can be said to
describe the anonymous writer. For example: was this writing done by someone
who was left-handed? At the moment the former is far more important, partly
because relatively little proper research has been done on the latter. </p><p>

Categorization deals entirely--by definition--with style characteristics:
those characteristics that are shared with other writers. Identification
deals with both: with individual characteristics--again, by definition--but
also with style characteristics, since in particular cases the appearance
of certain of these in a particular hand may serve to distinguish the …</p></div></div>

  <li>For each product, we need to cover the following disciplines: Frontend, Backend, Architecture, Operations, Mobile, UX, Design, QA, Leadership, and Product Management.</li>
  <li>There are broadly 3 experience levels:

  <li>No number of junior people can do some work a senior person can do.</li>
  <li>Not having a senior person in a discipline will mean that the product quality will suffer:
  <ul>
    <li>If a senior creates a plan, a team of mid-level+juniors can follow the plan for some time (2-3 years?) before the product becomes a big mess.</li>
    <li>To get out of a big mess, we need senior people.

      <li>We are already in a big mess with Product A and Product B.</li>
      <li>With the current team, it feels Product A is getting out of the mess.</li>

  <li>Independent (cross-functional) teams are more efficient:

    <li>More focus.</li>
    <li>No handoffs, faster feedback.</li>
    <li>No shared “resource” contention.</li>

  <li>People working in multiple products/teams are less efficient.</li>
  <li>Multidisciplinary (generalist) people:

    <li>Can cover the need for several of the disciplines.</li>
    <li>They can be junior in one discipline and senior in another.</li>
    <li>Allow focusing on any priority, without creating artificially important work for single-disciplined members.</li>

</ul><p>The ideal team would be one that has all disciplines covered at a senior level with multidisciplinary people working in just one team, and with enough overlap to avoid a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> of one. Additional people will bring additional capacity.</p><h2>Inverse Conway’s maneuver</h2><p>We have been working on bringing three of the products together for some time. They were already under the same product manager, but they were still three teams working on their own priorities. Merging them into one team, in a classic <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/01/08/do-i-need-a-gateway-api-team-dynamics/#content">inverse Conway’s maneuver</a> would hopefully accelerate the integration between the products.</p><p>One of the other products was small enough that for this task I decided to temporarily ignore it.</p><p>Following the principles above and the product considerations, the plan was to move the previous team setup from:</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day2/old-team-structure.jpg" alt="old team structure"> </p><p>To something like (boxes represent skills, not people):</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day2/new-team-structure.jpg" alt="new team structure"> </p><p>So two products, two cross-functional teams. Platforms and design teams will be reshuffled inside those two teams.</p><h2>Which parent do you love most? A computer will tell</h2><p>With a clear plan for the team, the next step was to <em>“just”</em> pick up who will work on each team, and who we will need to let go. The most painful decision in my career. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://danlebrero.com/2019/11/27/becoming-a-technical-leader-book-notes/#content">People with a strong technical background can convert any task into a technical task, thus avoiding work they don’t want to do.</a> <cite>Jerry Weinberg, Becoming a Technical Leader</cite></p>
</blockquote><p>And I didn’t want to do the task so, consciously ignoring Mr. Weinberg, I transformed the ordeal into an optimization problem, for which I wrote an application to help me with.</p><h3>The app</h3><p>The application took as input the amount of $$$ to cut, the list of people, their salary, and the skill level on each discipline mentioned above, and outputted the possible two teams that would be within budget and match the minimum requirements, sorted by a scoring system.</p><p>The minimum requirements and scoring system configuration looked like:</p>
<pre><code>{
"FE" [at-least-senior sum-skills]
"PM" [senior-plus-somebody-else (fix-points 5)]
"Design" [two-mid-or-senior (senior-better 6 2)]
...
}
</code></pre><p>The first function filters out invalid teams while the second scores the valid ones.</p><p>In the example we say that the team has to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least one senior FE developer. The more FE developers, the better team score.</li>
  <li>At least one senior product manager and one mid or junior one. Only one senior is not enough. No matter how many PMs the team has, the score for this discipline is 5. A team with loads of FE devs will score higher than one with loads of PMs.</li>
  <li>At least a senior designer or two mid-level designers, but we prefer one senior designer (6 points) instead of two mid-level ones (2 points).</li>
</ul><h3>The result</h3><p>As heartless as this may seem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It removed some bias. There is still bias on the skill level evaluation and in the team scoring system.</li>
  <li>I was part of the people on that list. To be honest, little consolation here. Big bias.</li>
  <li>It forced me to be very very precise on what a “functioning team” meant.</li>
  <li>It allowed me to see what different scoring systems would output.</li>
  <li>I noticed some people would never show in the output, and had to dig into why. It was enlightening.</li>
  <li>It allowed me to analyze tens of thousands of different team combinations, with different scoring systems.</li>
  <li>Programming gave me a respite from the task. This was the first time, but now I embrace more regularly “keep my sanity” programming days.</li>
</ul><p>Most important, the application gave me a few starting points. Of those, I still had to consider the team dynamics, existing teams, personalities, seniority, potential, personal situation, future needs, …</p>
<p>yes, I still have the code. No, I am not going to share it publicly. It would kill me to find there is a bug.</p><h2>Delivering the bad news</h2><p>Once the decision was made, it was time to swallow the last bitter pill.</p><p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the people affected are the first ones to know.</li>
  <li>Warn beforehand:
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use your regular one-to-one meeting slot.</li>
    <li>In your message, give a strong hint: “HR person will be in the meeting”, “Really bad news”.</li>
    <li>Give them time to get ready for the meeting.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You don’t need to do it alone. Our HR manager was present and was a huge support for both of us.</li>
  <li>Treat people like adults.</li>
  <li>At the meeting, follow Nadia van der Vlies’ <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/04/01/no-nonsense-leadership-summary/#bad-news">advice</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Deliver the blow:
    <ul>
      <li>Go straight to the bad news.</li>
      <li>Give one or two reasons.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Manage the reaction:
    <ul>
      <li>Be understanding. Do not justify yourself.</li>
      <li>Give space. Do not fill silences.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Solution, explanation, follow-up appointment:
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for the employee to be ready. When she starts asking “why” or “what now”.</li>
      <li>Reiterate reasons.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In a couple of days follow up with another more informal meeting. The news would have sunk, and the conversation would be more forward-thinking and productive.</li>
</ul>

    <p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/erporydxmaarwcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I recently found this piece of art (LINES 2A (2017)) created by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerxhobbs">Tyler Hobbs</a>. This picture kinda looked very hand drawn, but it’s completely generative. Something about this drawing and it’s texture kind of resonated with me, so I wanted to try to study and replicate (or make something inspired by this work) using p5js.</p>

<p>I started out by plotting a bunch of random points within a circle like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>w = 1000
function setup() {
  createCanvas(w, w);
  background('#F9F8F4');
}

function draw() {
  x = random(w)
  y = random(w)
  if (pow(w/2 - x, 2) + pow(w/2 - y, 2) &lt; 7e4) {
    point(x,y)
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-25.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a painfully slow process to generate random points in a circle. I found a better way to do this later. What I wanted to do next was to generate flow fields, but restricted to the circular region.</p>

<p>It’s super easy to generate flow field patterns using perlin noise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose a random point <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Plot <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Calculate <code>n = noise(x,y)</code></li>
  <li>Do <code>x+=cos(n * 2 * PI)</code> and <code>y+=sin(n * 2 * PI)</code></li>
  <li>Repeat 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re going to plot flow fields inside the circle. Let’s try this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const is_in_circle = (x, y) =&gt; 
  (pow(w / 2 - x, 2) + pow(w / 2 - y, 2) &lt; 7e4)

function draw() {
  if (is_in_circle(x = random(w), y = random(w)))
    while (is_in_circle(x, y)) {
      n = noise(x, y)
      x += sin(n * TAU)
      y += cos(n * TAU)
      point(x, y)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-28.png" alt=""></p>

<p>OK, not very good. The noise at this level is pretty rough. we’re going to zoom in to the noise function (by dividing the <code>x,y</code> inputs by some constant value) and probably use <code>circle(x ,y ,0.3)</code> to plot points instead if point function, because I feel it looks way smoother. Also, I’m adding a <code>random() &gt; 0.01</code> condition in the loop so that we also get short lines that are not trimmed away by the edge of the circle.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function draw() {
  if (is_in_circle(x = random(w), y = random(w)))
    while (is_in_circle(x, y) &amp;&amp; random() &gt; 0.01) {
      n = noise(x / 500, y / 500)
      x += sin(n * TAU)
      y += cos(n * TAU)
      circle(x, y, .3)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-27.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Actually.. not bad. I think we manage almost replicate the original texture. The inverted version also looks pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-19.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="going-further-animations">Going Further: Animations</h2>

<p>The code we wrote right now technically is animated. The animation however is not very smooth.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_03-52-31.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>To make smooth animations, we need to generate new points in the circle, keep track of these points outside the <code>draw()</code> function. I found this neat <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50746409">technique</a>, to find random points in a circle where a random radius <code>r</code> and angle <code>theta</code> are chosen and the <code>x,y</code> points are obtained as <code>x = centerX + r * cos(theta)</code> and <code>y = centerY + r * sin(theta)</code></p>

<p>Let’s try that first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function random_point() {
  r = random(w / 4)
  t = random(TAU)
  return [
    w/2 + cos(t) * r, 
    w/2 + sin(t) * r
  ]
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas((w = 1e3), w);
  background(255)
  k = w / 2
  m = (Array(w).fill(0)).map(random_point)
}

function draw() {
  for (i = k; --i;) {
    [x, y] = m[i]
    circle(x, y, .3);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-01-10-04-51-20.png" alt=""></p>

<p>and now we apply flow fields and try to move these points.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function random_point() {
  r = random(w / 4)
  t = random(TAU)
  return [
    w/2 + cos(t) * r, 
    w/2 + sin(t) * r
  ]
}

const w = 1000
function setup() {
  createCanvas(w, w);
  background('#F9F8F4')
  k = w / 2
  points = (Array(k).fill(0)).map(random_point)
}

function draw() {
  for (i = k; --i;) {
    [x, y] = m[i]
    x += sin(n = noise(x / 400, y / 400) * TAU) * h
    y += cos(n) * h
    stroke(i%255)
    circle(x, y,.3)
    if (pow(k - x, 2) + pow(k - y, 2) &lt; 7e4)  // if point is in circle
      points[i] = [x, y, t]
    else points[i] = random_point() // replace with new point if not
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a つぶやきProcessing version of course..</p>

<h2 id="adding-colors">Adding Colors</h2>

<p>There are many strategies to colorizing this sketch. One is by just giving each particle a random initial color.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-21.png" alt=""></p>

<p>However, I found that maintaining the initial x or y position in the particle array and using that to derive the hue information gives us some nice Jupiter/gaseous planet vibes.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_05-18-19.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>The fringing at the sides can be avoided by moving 50% of the points in the reverse direction.</p>

<p>More color variations</p>

<p>And that’s it. Hope this was educational!</p>

January 10, 2021 | https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/blocks-courtesy-of-konrad-zuse | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/blocks-courtesy-of-konrad-zuse">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apparently, I've got a theme going of Weird Syntax. Let's run with it.</p>

<p>Konrad Zuse was an early pioneer in computer science, although his name is perhaps somewhat less well-known than others. Zuse holds the honor of having built the first programmable computer—-the Z3—-back in the 40's, as well as several other computing firsts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup>. Of particular interest to this blog post is his early unimplemented programming language, Plankalkül.</p>

<p>Plankalkül was, like the Z3, in many respects ahead of its time. Zuse's explicit goal was to be able to describe programs at a high level, which meant he included control structures and datatype definitions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup> and other high-level constructs that were often missing in languages of the early years of computing. Zuse was working on Plankalkül at a time when his machines were not useable, which meant that his language work was more theoretical than it was technical, and consequently he allowed features that he wasn't entirely sure how to program. Despite his notes on it having been written in the mid-40's, they were not published until the 70's, and it was not implemented until the year 2000.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me, as I read programs in this notation that had been set down on a typewriter<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="nofollow">3</a></sup>, is that certain kinds of grouping were handled by explicit indication of scope: not via matched delimiters as in ALGOL-style languages, or via indentation in languages such as Python and Haskell, but by formatting the code so that a line bordered on the left of the scoped parts of the code:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/static/zuse-01.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is meant to capture the way grouping works in the hand-written or typeset notation, with brackets spanning multiple lines:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/static/zuse-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I think this is notationally interesting: it's like Python's significant whitespace, but not, uh, whitespace. It would be incredibly tedious to type out, but still entirely compatible with current programming notation:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 | @staticmethod
 | def new_tet()
 |  | n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 |  | for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 |  |  | if p in Board.permanent
 |  |  |  | Game.lose()
 |  | Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 |
 | def __init__(self, points, color)
 |  | self.points = points
 |  | self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>and would be entirely amenable to beautifying via judicious application of Unicode:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 ┃ @staticmethod
 ┃ def new_tet()
 ┃  ┃ n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 ┃  ┃ for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 ┃  ┃  ┃ if p in Board.permanent
 ┃  ┃  ┗  ┗ Game.lose()
 ┃  ┗ Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 ┃
 ┃ def __init__(self, points, color)
 ┃  ┃ self.points = points
 ┃  ┗ self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at this notation, however, an interesting possibility struck me: a programmer could explicit annotate information about the <em>kind of scope</em> involved in a given line. In this Python-like example, I could, for example, distinguish class scope using double lines, function scope with thick lines, and control structure scope with thin lines:</p>

<pre><code>class Tet
 ║ @staticmethod
 ║ def new_tet()
 ║  ┃ n = randint(0, len(Tet.Tets) - 1)
 ║  ┃ for p in Tet.Tets[n]
 ║  ┃  │ if p in Board.permanent
 ║  ┃  └  └ Game.lose()
 ║  ┗ Game.current = Tet(Tet.Tets[n], Tet.TetColors[n])
 ║
 ║ def __init__(self, points, color)
 ║  ┃ self.points = points
 ║  ┗ self.color = color
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage of this scheme is that a handful of lines, viewed in isolation, still give you a clear view of what surrounds them. For example, I can view these two lines in isolation and still tell that they are within a control structure used within a function declared within a class:</p>

<pre><code> ║  ┃  │ if p in Board.permanent
 ║  ┃  └  └ Game.lose()
</code></pre>

<p>You could also imagine a hypothetical language in which choice of scope delimiter is important. In Python, <code>for</code> and <code>if</code> do not form a new lexical scope. What if instead we could stipulate the kind of scope they form by this notational convention?</p>

<pre><code>def okay()
 ┃ if True
 ┃  └ n = 5   # n is declared in function scope
 ┗ return n   # n leaks out of the if-scope

def not_okay()
 ┃ if True
 ┃  ┗ n = 5   # n is declared in the if's scope
 ┗ return n   # error: no n in scope here
</code></pre>

<p>That being said, there are a number of reasons that this notation is in inferior to existing notations:</p>
<ul><li>It makes refactoring code <em>much</em> more difficult.</li>
<li>It requires that the programmer <em>pay attention</em> to the sequence of enclosing scopes on a <em>line-by-line</em> basis, which is generally too pedantic and not particularly useful for a programmer.</li>
<li>The ability to select “which kind of scope” is by no means only expressible by this notation, as other syntactic features such as keywords and delimiters could express the same thing.</li>
<li>There are only so many line-like characters which can serve as a scope marker, so this scheme is not very extensible.</li>
<li>It complicates parsing (especially by introducing an entirely new class of parse errors in which adjacent lines feature incompatible sequences of delimiting lines), and so it also...</li>
<li>Complicates parse <em>error messages</em>, which are an important part of a language's UI and should be considered seriously.</li></ul>

<p>So, as in my previous post on <a href="https://journal.infinitenegativeutility.com/2014/8/noun-case" rel="nofollow">grammatical case in programming languages</a>, I urge readers <em>not</em> to use this notation as the concrete syntax for a programming language. This is merely an entertaining peek through the looking glass at a curious notational convention which was never adopted.</p>

<p>That said: this makes a very nice notation for <em>viewing</em> code, where the programmer does not have to explicitly draw ASCII art around their code; indeed, it bears more than a passing similarity to the graphical interface used in <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">Scratch</a>, and Sean McDirmid's <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liveprogramming/typography.aspx" rel="nofollow">Experiments in Code Typography</a> features this very convention as an interactive ornament on code in a Python-like language.</p>

<p>Instead of Gekko, why not use for instance Python, or R, or GAMS, or MATLAB, or SAS, or Excel, or … ?</p>
<p>Software packages are typically aimed at some purpose, and this is reflected in, among other things, the underlying data structures and the syntax of the command language.</p>
<p>Since Gekko is timeseries-oriented, the syntax for handling and analyzing timeseries and timeseries-based models is concise and natural. Gekko does not try to do everything, but tries to focus on its strong points, while simultaneously providing good interfaces to other software packages.</p>

			<p><span>H</span>umans once lived in harmony with the natural world. Consider timekeeping. Until relatively recently, the human notion of time was based on the natural rhythms of nature. Time was measured by a new moon, the first snow, a migrating bird, or the ebb and flow of a river. Time meant situating ourselves as part of a larger web of life.</p><p>Western society has since lost its connection to nature. Human-created days, hours, minutes, seconds meticulously dictate our lives. Our sense of time is now detached from the world around us. Modern clocks provide many important services by establishing predictability in a complex and fast-paced world. But the loss of our interconnectivity with nature’s timekeepers has diminished our relationship with nature.</p><figure data-alt="Wilson_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18075_0bbe3f9c489c409d1d6e229ccd23ab00.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>OF TIME AND THE RIVER:</strong> The Anchorage Museum displays “Alaska River Time,” an art project by Jonathon Keats, which uses the natural flow of a river as a timekeeping standard. Keats’ project exemplifies the growing cultural awareness of our interrelationship with nature.</span><span>Courtesy of the Anchorage Museum</span></figcaption></figure><p>Timekeeping is not the only way in which we have lost touch with nature. Many elements of Western society treat humans as separate from and superior to the natural world. Nature was once perceived as living—even sacred. Now it is treated as a human commodity. Under Western legal systems, humans possess rights while the rest of nature does not. Entire cities have been built over once wondrous ecosystems that we sparsely acknowledge. Few people realize that entombed rivers still flow invisibly below cities such as New York, London, and Paris. Nature is still here, but it is often subjugated and ignored.<br></p><p>We can reclaim our deep relationship with nature, essential to solving the environmental crisis. It begins with two movements: cultural and legal. The cultural one arises from artists, writers, and other creatives whose work reshapes our thinking by underscoring that humans are part of nature, not separate from it. The legal one involves harmonizing human laws with the laws of the Earth. This means rewriting the legal system so it represents nature’s rights and interests directly alongside our own. A new generation of “Earth lawyers,” including me, have taken up this challenging task.</p><p><span>T</span>he illusion of separation between humans and nature began about 11,000 years ago, when the first agriculture-based societies emerged. From 800 to 300 B.C., philosophers and religions began to champion human superiority and dominion over nature. Scientists like Francis Bacon and philosophers like René Descartes popularized their conceptions of Earth as a machine or giant clock that was possible to control and exploit as long as we pulled the right levers.</p><p>Midway through the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution catalyzed the development of an economic system that viewed nature as a form of natural capital rather than a life source. New economic paradigms encouraged industry to incessantly exploit nature to fuel monetary growth without limits. Modern democracy and human rights also emerged during this period, but they focused on the well-being of individuals rather than the larger community of life. In accordance with the dominant systems of law and economics, society came to normalize the separation of humans and nature.</p><blockquote><p>The law establishes a legal duty for humans to protect and restore ecosystems to health because that is their right.</p> </blockquote><p>The next period, from post-World War II through the present, is sometimes called the “Great Acceleration.” Measures of human growth and impact, such as population, GDP, water and energy use, ocean acidification, and forest loss, began to increase nearly exponentially during this time.<sup>1</sup> New economic policies commodified nearly all aspects of life, including air, water, forests, countless plant and animal species, and food, among others. Corporations began to exploit unprotected ecosystems until they reached total collapse. Consumerism became a way of life.<br></p><p>We have killed off 68 percent of vertebrate animal populations over the last 50 years.<sup>2</sup> Nearly one in six species faces extinction due to climate change.<sup>3</sup> Humans felled 46 percent of all trees, as well as 20 percent of the Amazon in the last 50 years alone.<sup>4</sup> We destroyed half of the world’s coral reefs and are well on our way to a world where they are totally wiped out.<sup>5</sup> Humans suffer, as well, from the precipitous decline of nature. Some 7 million humans die each year due to air pollution, including 100,000 annually in the United States.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;</p><p><span>A</span>lthough most of the world largely continues with business as usual, a growing number of governments have embraced cutting-edge legal solutions that would allow humans to live in harmony with nature.</p><p>One of the most promising legal solutions is “rights of nature.” It recognizes that nature is a “legal entity” or “persons” with fundamental rights. This movement received global attention when Ecuador recognized the rights of nature in its 2008 Constitution. Now, rights of nature is recognized in some 12 countries through a combination of national and local legislation, landmark court decisions, treaty agreements, and other legal developments.</p><div>

</div><p>Rights of nature corrects shortcomings of modern environmental laws. Environmental laws operate as a tourniquet, creating rules to prevent nature’s loss but doing little to address root causes—such as an economy that incentivizes the maximum exploitation of nature for profit. By contrast, rights of nature establishes a legal duty for humans to protect and restore ecosystems to health because that is their right.</p><p>The rights of nature, although still in its early stages, is gaining momentum. In 2017, the Constitutional Court of Colombia declared the Atrato River—one of Colombia’s largest rivers—to be a “subject of rights,” with rights to protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration. The Court also created a guardianship body to serve as the voice of the river, just as a child might have a legal guardian. Finally, the Court ordered state authorities to create a plan—a blueprint is in the works—to decontaminate waterways in the Atrato River basin, to end illegal mining, and take other actions to uphold the rights of rivers.</p><blockquote><p>Two forces, law and culture, will converge to create transformative change. In the meantime, go meet your local river.</p> </blockquote><p>In New Zealand, the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017 recognized the Whanganui River as a living entity and legal person, solidifying a 2012 treaty agreement between the Whanganui Iwi (a Maori tribe) and New Zealand’s crown government. It establishes a guardianship body to promote the river’s health and well-being and serve as its “human face.” Already, the legislation is being put into practice. In 2020, a new governance structure for a port revitalization project on the Whanganui River announced that the river’s indivisible nature and the community’s collective obligation to benefit the river will guide its decision-making.<sup>7</sup><br></p><p>There are other instances of ecosystems being recognized as having rights or personhood. In 2019, the highest court in Bangladesh recognized the rights of all rivers and instituted a plan to address illegal river encroachment. In the United States, the Klamath and Snake Rivers are recognized as having rights by the Yurok and Nez Perce Tribes, respectively. In Mexico, three states have amended their constitutions to recognize the rights of nature, and lawmakers in Oaxaca, Mexico, are proposing to establish the rights of rivers and create a robust legal guardianship body for implementation.</p><p>Granting legal rights to nature could become society’s next major rights-based milestone as part of a larger movement toward the implementation of “Earth law” (like “human rights law” but for the planet). Establishing the rights of nature is an essential piece of the solution to the ecological crisis.</p><p><span>N</span>ot only does the rights of nature give ecosystems a voice in our legal system, it influences our culture. In the case of the Whanganui River, tens of thousands of people have learned how the Maori tribes that live along the Whanganui treat the river as their ancestor and see themselves as its guardians. Numerous global gatherings have celebrated the Whanganui River and other waterways that are now “persons.” A 2019 law journal article in <i>Ecology Law Quarterly</i> writes metaphorically about the “songs” of the Whanganui river and others—songs that are sad, discordant, muted, loving, trusting, or inspiring—and suggests to its predominantly legal readers, “Let us sit beside the river and wait patiently for its song.”<sup>7</sup> A new mindset is emerging in which humans learn to listen to and guard rivers rather than exploit them. The law influences culture, and culture influences the law.</p><p>Many varieties of cultural changes will accelerate the legal movement toward rights of nature. We can reinvent our language so that we no longer describe nature as our “property” or a “resource,” but rather refer to nature as persons, family members, kin, or co-inhabitants of the planet. Movies, songs, TV shows, books, and other artworks that showcase nature being alive and having its own rights can galvanize culture and will help fuel legal battles.</p><p>Timekeeping, too, can become part of the cultural movement toward the rights of nature. Specifically, we can create new standards of time that recognize our deep relationship with the natural world. Experimental philosopher, artist, and writer <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/79/catalysts/philosophy-is-a-public-service" target="_blank">Jonathon Keats</a> has collaborated with the Anchorage Museum to create <a href="http://alaskarivertime.org/" target="_blank">Alaska River Time</a>, which uses the natural flow of a river as a timekeeping standard. The speed of a clock increases or decreases based on the flow of a …</p></div></div>

Dominguez / CERN</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>I</span>n a recent experiment done at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, in Germany, physicist Alexey Grinin and his colleagues came a step closer to resolving one of the more significant puzzles to have arisen in particle physics over the past decade. The puzzle is this: Ordinarily, when you set about measuring the size of something, you’d expect to get the same answer no matter what you use to measure it—a soda can has the diameter it does whether you measure it with a tape measure or callipers (provided these are properly calibrated, of course). Something must be amiss if your attempts to measure the can return different answers depending on the equipment, yet this is precisely what’s happened over multiple attempts to measure the spatial extent of a proton. What’s potentially at stake is our understanding of the building blocks of reality: the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1061.abstract" target="_blank">differing measurements</a> could be heralding the existence of new forces or particles.</p><p>What does it mean for a subatomic particle to have a measurable “size”? Mathematically, fundamental particles are idealized as point particles, which is to say that, as far as we can tell, they have no meaningfully discernible spatial extent, or substructure, at all. True, all fundamental particles are associated with a quantum mechanical wave packet, which does have a spatial extent that depends on the energy of the particle. Yet these basic bits of Lego are entities whose wave packets you can, in principle, pack into as small a region as you’d like before the very notion of continuum geometry starts, at the Planck scale, to lose meaning. Fundamental particles organize into something analogous to a mini periodic table—consisting of the various force carrying particles, such as photons and gluons (the carrier particles of the strong nuclear force), along with three generations of quarks and leptons and the mass-generating Higgs boson—and can stack together in different combinations to form a zoo of so-called composite particles.</p><blockquote><p>There is less than one in about a trillion chance that the discrepancy could be a statistical fluke.</p> </blockquote><p>Perhaps the most familiar and ubiquitous of these is the proton. With at least one in every kind of element, it’s made up of two up quarks and a down quark that dance around each other in a tightly bound orbit maintained by exchanging gluons. This exchange process is so energetic that most of the mass of the proton (or for that matter, most of the material that makes us up) derives from the energy contained in these gluons—a consequence, as Einstein informed us, of <i>E</i> being equal to <i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;<br></p><figure data-alt=""><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18083_78b8d6620afcd434a4b7fb41b22e595b.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><i>Fundamental particles organize into something analogous to a mini periodic table (above).</i></span><span>CERN</span></figcaption></figure><p>So it’s not meaningless to ask what the “size” of the proton is. The study by Grinin’s team highlights the fact that defining this notion remains a rather tricky affair. And, as we’ll see, their results serve to sharpen the mystery as to why other measurement methods researchers have used previously disagree.<br></p><p>A physicist can reasonably infer a proton’s size from the “charge radius”—roughly the averaged spatial extent of quark orbits inside. This quantity is probed in slightly different ways by electrons and muons (another sort of fundamental particle), when you probe their orbital configurations as they form “bound states” with the proton—atomic hydrogen in the case of electrons, muonic hydrogen in the case of muons. Because muons are about 200 times heavier than electrons, their lowest energy orbital configurations are much more tightly bound around the proton than are electrons in atomic hydrogen. Consequently, the differences in the energies of various orbitals in muonic hydrogen are much more sensitive to the proton’s size as well as being more “high pitched” than that of regular atomic hydrogen.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, similar to how plucking a guitar string at a given tension produces a much higher note were we to fret it open, or at 1/200th its open length, the typical frequencies of the radiation emitted by transitions in muonic hydrogen are about 200 times higher than that in atomic hydrogen. These frequencies relate to something called the Rydberg constant—the tension of the guitar string in the analogy—which appears to be one of the potentially more significant sources of uncertainty proton size-wise. Orbital energy levels depend on both this constant and the charge radius of the proton.</p><p>Proton-size measurements didn’t conflict for decades. Different methods—like measuring the radius by observing electrons orbit within hydrogen atoms, or by scattering energetic electrons off of unbound protons—had converged on a value of 0.875 (give or take 0.006) femtometers. That’s a little less than a trillionth of a millimeter. That convergence was disrupted in 2010, when a paper came out titled, “The size of the proton.” As the researchers reported, <a href="http://www.quantum.physik.uni-potsdam.de/teaching/ss2015/pqt/Pohl2010.pdf" target="_blank">measurements</a> involving orbital configurations in muonic hydrogen returned a value of 0.842, give or take 0.001 femtometers. This may not seem like much of a difference, but it’s the accompanying error bars that matter. The measurements are, individually, so precise that their disagreement is over seven standard deviations—there is less than one in about a trillion chance that the discrepancy could be a statistical fluke.</p><p>There are only two possibilities for the anomalous result if the equipment used in the experiments and their calibrations all check out after careful scrutiny. Either some combination of physical constants, which researchers assume in order to experimentally infer the proton charge radius, isn’t known as accurately as we thought, or there is something different about the way muons interact with protons, compared to electrons, that renders particle physics incomplete.</p><p>The latter possibility, if substantiated, would, of course, cause a flurry of excitement among theoretical physicists to say the least, as it could imply the existence of new forces and particles. Not only would it reshape our understanding of the universe, it would represent a throwback to the days when physicists discovered particles (<a href="https://timeline.web.cern.ch/anderson-and-neddermeyer-discover-muon" target="_blank">such as the muon itself</a>) using equipment that could fit on a proverbial tabletop.</p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>Over the past few years, various teams have been attempting to get to the bottom of the matter by looking at different orbital transitions in atomic hydrogen that are sensitive to different combinations of the Rydberg constant and the charge radius. A 2019 <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/1007" target="_blank">measurement</a> by a group of researchers at York University in Canada looked at a particular orbital transition that was independent of the value of this constant, finding a value of 0.833 ± 0.010 femtometers, consistent with the smaller value obtained in muonic hydrogen.&nbsp;</p><p>Grinin’s team went a step further. They used a technique known as frequency comb spectroscopy. It involves pulses of laser light that are a superposition of equally spaced frequencies—a ruler in frequency space if you will—that allowed them to look at two different orbital transitions in atomic hydrogen sensitive to two different combinations of the proton size and the Rydberg constant. This permitted them to determine both with unprecedented accuracy. The technique reduced, to only about one part in ten trillion, the observational uncertainties in the frequency of light these transitions emitted—a staggering degree of accuracy by any standard.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did Grinin’s team find a value for the charge radius of the proton consistent with the value obtained in muonic hydrogen, they inferred a much more precise value for the Rydberg constant. This accounted for some part of the discrepancy seen in other measurements in atomic hydrogen (which presumed a less accurate value).</p><p>It thus appears that the experimental value of the proton charge radius Grinin’s team obtained in atomic hydrogen is converging on the smaller values for the proton charge radius other researchers initially obtained in muonic hydrogen. The smaller value has by now even been adopted as the <a href="https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?rp" target="_blank">official value</a> on the National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/codata-values-fundamental-physical-constants" target="_blank">CODATA</a> list of recommended physical constants—the official almanac for nuclear and atomic chemists and physicists.&nbsp;</p><p>Although this convergence, based on the continued refinement of experimental techniques, did not deliver the new physics some may have been hoping for, even the most despondent theoretical physicist can acknowledge the experimental artistry that seems to be bringing the matter closer to conclusion. What remains unresolved is the reason why measurements, relying on different spectroscopic methods in atomic hydrogen, return different values for the charge radius of the proton. The mystery, and along with it, the diminishing hope of particle physicists, endures for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>This was enough motivation for a team of theoretical physicists, led by Cliff Burgess at the Perimeter Institute, in Canada, to systematically catalogue all possible sources of theoretical uncertainty in atomic spectroscopy over a <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&amp;size=25&amp;page=1&amp;q=find%20a%20burgess,%20c%20and%20a%20zalavari" target="_blank">series of papers</a>. By isolating the ways in which new forces and particles might leave a tell-tale signature, they’ve thrown the gauntlet firmly back to the experimentalists. Future experiments, as always, will be the ultimate arbiter in this matter.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Subodh Patil is an assistant professor at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at Leiden University.

<p>A reader recently complained to me about the hyperlinks on this blog. The reader thought the links were too hard to distinguish from the rest of the text. And the reader’s right. The Swedish Greys desktop theme that I thought looked cool eight years ago, while attractive in an aesthetic sense (to me at least), is not the most usable or accessible. I’ll be looking for another theme.</p>

<p>I was able to style my blog however I wanted to and it looks the same in all browsers. That’s the flexibility of good HTML/CSS standards. Every site can look and behave exactly as the creator envisioned. It’s also why the Web’s a usability nightmare. We have to learn to use every site we visit because every site is designed differently. How come when we talk about Web standards the focus is almost entirely on technical standards? Where is the worry about design standards?</p>

<p>I recently finished reading the classic book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2JZgkSD">The Design of Everyday Things</a></em> by Don Norman and it talks about standards. Normans says “When all else fails, standardize.” Basically when you have no other way of implementing good design, you turn to standardization so at least every user only needs to learn how to use the similar things (in this case web pages) once. And I think we have no other way, because if we did, we would have figured it out in the past 30 years.</p>

<p>It wasn’t always this way. I remember using the pre-CSS and pre-JavaScript Web as a little kid on Mosaic. You knew there that the blue underlined text was always a hyperlink. And you knew that the back button always took you back a page. And you didn’t have to worry what different actions buttons did, because there was no JavaScript. I’m not saying we should go back there, but in many ways having the constraints made pages easier to use. There was no need to think. Now we have no constraints, but that’s why we need standards.</p>

<p>Every other major consumer computing platform but the Web has design standards. Apple’s platforms are famous for their Human Interface Guidelines. They are an attempt to ensure all apps follow some standard design conventions. Not every app does, but Apple has some ability to enforce them through its app stores, and some users even demand developers follow them. So, they are at least kinda sorta followed by most major apps. If the Web had design standards, maybe users would demand developers follow them too. Google and Microsoft have design suggestions and guidelines for their developers. This is why a good app for each platform feels “at home.”</p>

<p>But we have no design guidelines for the Web that are widely accepted. Sure, people have tried. But the only way we’re going to get something that’s actually followed is if we have a standard. And a standard needs to come from a standards body (Apple, Microsoft, and Google are the standards bodies for their respective platforms). W3C, please put some focus on a design standard. Not everybody will be forced to follow it, but it could do a lot of good in terms of usability.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <main>
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I’ve been writing code in vim for the past several years, and in this post I’d like to share some tips on configuring a development environment. This post contains some notes on configuration that would have helped me when I first started using vim and working on my own config. I hope that as a result of reading this, you will be able to improve your workflow with some new features and make the development process easier and more convenient.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at common tasks that occur when editing code and try to automate and improve them using vim. Each section contains a brief description of the problem, a proposed solution, overview of alternatives, a full code listing for the configuration, and a screenshot or animated screencast with a demonstration. At the end, additional links to useful plugins and resources will be provided.</p>
<p>Most of the tasks come down to installing and properly configuring one or more plugins. I assume that you are an experienced vim user and already use one of the plugin managers.</p>
<p>All of these tips are applicable in both vim and neovim. Also, despite the title, some of these tips can be applied not only to C++, but also to any other language.</p>
<h2 id="removing-trailing-whitespaces">Removing trailing whitespaces</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a very simple problem. Some code conventions restrict the leaving of trailing whitespaces. For example, the Linux Kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#spaces">prohibits</a> from doing this.</p>
<p>So we’d like to see when we accidentally leave a space at the end of a line. Let’s add the following lines in your vim configuration file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>highlight</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>ctermbg</span>=<span>red</span> <span>guibg</span>=<span>red</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>BufWinEnter</span> * <span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>InsertEnter</span> * <span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+\%#\@&lt;!$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>InsertLeave</span> * <span>match</span> <span>ExtraWhitespace</span> <span>/\s\+$/</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>BufWinLeave</span> * <span>call</span> <span>clearmatches</span>()<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>As a result, extra whitespaces will be highlighted as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/trailing-ws.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We also want to remove extra spaces by the single key binding. Let’s define it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>" Remove all trailing whitespaces</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>leader</span>&gt;<span>rs</span> :<span>let</span> <span>_s</span>=@<span>/ &lt;Bar&gt; :%s/</span>\<span>s</span>\+$<span>//</span><span>e</span> &lt;<span>Bar</span>&gt; :<span>let</span> @/=<span>_s</span> &lt;<span>Bar</span>&gt; :<span>nohl</span> &lt;<span>Bar</span>&gt; :<span>unlet</span> <span>_s</span> &lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>So we can solve this simple problem.</p>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/82yv3p/anyone_know_how_to_get_the_dots_for_leading/dveznas?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">can show</a> all whitespaces and line breaks in the source code.</li>
<li>There is <a href="https://editorconfig.org/">editorconfig</a> <a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim">plugin</a> for vim that supports the <code>trim_trailing_whitespace</code> option. When it is set to <code>true</code> the plugin will remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters.</li>
<li>See <a href="##formatting-source-code-with-clang-format">clang-format</a> section below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accessing-standard-library-documentation-using-cppman">Accessing Standard Library documentation using <code>cppman</code></h2>
<p>Vim ships with a man page viewer that works out of the box on any modern *nix via <a href="https://vimhelp.org/filetype.txt.html#ft-man-plugin">:Man</a> command. But the system man pages do not contain the definitions for C++. Let’s fix it by installing <a href="https://github.com/aitjcize/cppman">Cppman</a>.</p>
<p>Cppman is a set of C++ 98/11/14/17/20 manual pages for Linux, with source from <a href="https://cplusplus.com/">cplusplus.com</a> and <a href="https://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>. You can easily install using <code>pip</code> or the package manager for your distribution according to their <a href="https://github.com/aitjcize/cppman#installation">Installation guide</a>. Next, let’s configure vim.</p>
<p>By default, when you press <code>K</code>, vim grabs the keyword under the cursor, separated by <a href="https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27iskeyword%27">iskeyword</a> symbols. There is one problem. The <code>:</code> symbol often found in C++ definitions is not included in the <code>iskeyword</code> array. So, for example, when you press <code>K</code> under the keyword <code>std::string</code>, vim will try to find the man page for <code>std</code>, instead of the full identifier. Let’s fix it with this small function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>function</span>! <span>s</span>:<span>JbzCppMan</span>()<span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> <span>old_isk</span> = &amp;<span>iskeyword</span><span>
</span><span></span>    <span>setl</span> <span>iskeyword</span>+=:<span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> <span>str</span> = <span>expand</span>(<span>"&lt;cword&gt;"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> &amp;<span>l</span>:<span>iskeyword</span> = <span>old_isk</span><span>
</span><span></span>    <span>execute</span> <span>'Man '</span> . <span>str</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>endfunction</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>command</span>! <span>JbzCppMan</span> :<span>call</span> <span>s</span>:<span>JbzCppMan</span>()<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We also need to remap the default <code>K</code> key binding to use our function in C++:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>au</span> <span>FileType</span> <span>cpp</span> <span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>buffer</span>&gt;<span>K</span> :<span>JbzCppMan</span>&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Here is a result:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/cppman.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="browsing-online-documentation-from-vim">Browsing online documentation from vim</h2>
<p>But what if you also want to quickly access online documentation for your favorite library or framework? Or may be search for unknown keywords on StackOverflow, Google or similar sites? And it is desirable to make a solution that can be easily extended to support more search engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tyru/open-browser.vim">open-browser.vim</a> can help us. This is a plugin that allows you open URLs in your favorite browser using vim.</p>
<p>Install it using your package manager. Then let’s add a simple configuration to access cppreference and Qt documentation pages:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>let</span> <span>g</span>:<span>openbrowser_search_engines</span> = <span>extend</span>(<span>
</span><span></span>\ <span>get</span>(<span>g</span>:, <span>'openbrowser_search_engines'</span>, {}),<span>
</span><span></span>\ {<span>
</span><span></span>\   <span>'cppreference'</span>: <span>'https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;search={query}'</span>,<span>
</span><span></span>\   <span>'qt'</span>: <span>'https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/search-results.html?q={query}'</span>,<span>
</span><span></span>\ },<span>
</span><span></span>\ <span>'keep'</span><span>
</span><span></span>\)<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>And add some convenient key bindings by this way:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>leader</span>&gt;<span>osx</span> :<span>call</span> <span>openbrowser</span>#<span>smart_search</span>(<span>expand</span>(<span>'&lt;cword&gt;'</span>), <span>"cppreference"</span>)&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>leader</span>&gt;<span>osq</span> :<span>call</span> <span>openbrowser</span>#<span>smart_search</span>(<span>expand</span>(<span>'&lt;cword&gt;'</span>), <span>"qt"</span>)&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>As a result we can quickly browse online documentation for the word under the cursor:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/openbrowser.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Further use of this plugin is limited only by your imagination. For example, you can use it to search for similar C++ snippets in open source projects on GitHub:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>'github-cpp'</span>: <span>'http://github.com/search?l=C%2B%2B&amp;q=fork%3Afalse+language%3AC%2B%2B+{query}&amp;type=Code'</span>,<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Or integrate it with <a href="https://grep.app/">grep.app</a> or <a href="https://codesearch.debian.net/">Debian Code Search</a>. Or add integration with your favorite online translation service, if you work with multiple languages. You get the idea. The main thing is to write the configuration correctly.</p>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KabbAmine/zeavim.vim">zeavim.vim</a> is a plugin that implements the integration with <a href="https://zealdocs.org/">Zeal</a> – free and open source offline documentation browser. In fact, it solves the same problem. You may want to use it if you don’t have an internet connection, or you need access to documentation for a specific version of the framework that isn’t available online.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rhysd/devdocs.vim">devdocs.vim</a> is a plugin for <a href="https://devdocs.io/">devdocs</a> which also provides multiple API documentations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="switching-between-source-and-header-file">Switching between source and header file</h2>
<p>Switching between source and header files is another common operation when working with C++.</p>
<p>After searching and trying many solutions, I settled on <a href="https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-fswitch">vim-fswitch</a> plugin. Personally, I like this plugin for its simple configuration for various file types and the absence of third-party dependencies.</p>
<p>Install it with your favorite package manager. It will perfectly works out of the box, but sometimes you want to configure switch destination files like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>au</span> <span>BufEnter</span> *.<span>h</span>  <span>let</span> <span>b</span>:<span>fswitchdst</span> = <span>"c,cpp,cc,m"</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>BufEnter</span> *.<span>cc</span> <span>let</span> <span>b</span>:<span>fswitchdst</span> = <span>"h,hpp"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>It also will be convenient to set up some key bindings:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>A</span>-<span>o</span>&gt; :<span>FSHere</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>" Extra hotkeys to open header/source in the split</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>localleader</span>&gt;<span>oh</span> :<span>FSSplitLeft</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>localleader</span>&gt;<span>oj</span> :<span>FSSplitBelow</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>localleader</span>&gt;<span>ok</span> :<span>FSSplitAbove</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span><span></span><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>localleader</span>&gt;<span>ol</span> :<span>FSSplitRight</span>&lt;<span>cr</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many other options described in this <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Easily_switch_between_source_and_header_file">vimwiki article</a>. You can try them or write your own solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ctags</code> is a convenient indexing tool that allows you to go to symbol definition from your project using <code>tags</code> database. This is an old and reliable tool, that is <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/FAQ/CodeBrowsing">recommended</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33682137/8541499">to use</a> for large code bases like Linux Kernel where other tools like LSP may get stuck.</p>
<p>The most actual and maintained implementation of ctags is <a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">universal-ctags</a>. It is available in all popular distributions.</p>
<p>Vim has integrated ctags support. But here is one annoying thing. We need to generate <code>tags</code> database for each project using something like <code>ctags -R .</code>. Moreover, we need re-generate <code>tags</code> when editing the project.</p>
<p>This of course can be automated. Install <a href="https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags">vim-guttentags</a> is a plugin that will asynchronously (re)generate tag files as you work. I also suggest adding a simple configuration to avoid indexing of some unwanted files:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>set</span> <span>tags</span>=./<span>tags</span>;<span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span> <span>g</span>:<span>gutentags_ctags_exclude_wildignore</span> = <span>1</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span> <span>g</span>:<span>gutentags_ctags_exclude</span> = [<span>
</span><span></span>  \<span>'node_modules'</span>, <span>'_build'</span>, <span>'build'</span>, <span>'CMakeFiles'</span>, <span>'.mypy_cache'</span>, <span>'venv'</span>,<span>
</span><span></span>  \<span>'*.md'</span>, <span>'*.tex'</span>, <span>'*.css'</span>, <span>'*.html'</span>, <span>'*.json'</span>, <span>'*.xml'</span>, <span>'*.xmls'</span>, <span>'*.ui'</span>]<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>This makes your workflow simpler and more convenient. See also <a href="https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Browsing_programs_with_tags">this</a> detailed vimwiki article if you need more information about using ctags.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-source-file-structure-with-vistavim">Exploring source file structure with <code>vista.vim</code></h2>
<p>When you are working with unfamiliar source code, it may be convenient to browse the structure of the current source file. What classes, functions, macroses are defined here?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">vista.vim</a> is a plugin that helps us. It opens a split with the current file definitions. Here is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/vista.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This plugin shows both LSP and ctags symbols. The LSP configuration is beyond the scope of this post, but it is a very useful feature that can give more accurate information.</p>
<p>To use it, install <a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">vista.vim</a> with your favorite package manager and add a convenient key binding to toggle Vista split:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>nnoremap</span> &lt;<span>silent</span>&gt; &lt;<span>A</span><span>-6</span>&gt; :<span>Vista</span>!!&lt;<span>CR</span>&gt;<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preservim/tagbar">tagbar</a> is another plugin that provides a way to get the overview of the file structure. Unlike vista.vim, it doesn’t support LSP symbols and doesn’t provide useful utility functions for retrieving the information about the symbol under the cursor. But it’s simpler and more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display-the-current-function-in-the-status-line">Display the current function in the status line</h2>
<p>Another feature of <a href="https://github.com/liuchengxu/vista.vim">vista.vim</a> is that it shares information of the symbol under the cursor. Using this we can display the current function name in the status line. This helps us navigate when moving through a large file.</p>
<p>Bellow is an example of configuration for the <a href="https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim">lightline</a>, but you can easily adapt it to your status bar:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="vim"><span>function</span>! <span>LightlineCurrentFunctionVista</span>() <span>abort</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>let</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> = <span>get</span>(<span>b</span>:, <span>'vista_nearest_method_or_function'</span>, <span>''</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>  <span>if</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> != <span>''</span><span>
</span><span></span>    <span>let</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> = <span>'['</span> . <span>l</span>:<span>method</span> . <span>']'</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>endif</span><span>
</span><span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>l</span>:<span>method</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>endfunction</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>au</span> <span>VimEnter</span> * <span>call</span> <span>vista</span>#<span>RunForNearestMethodOrFunction</span>()<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://idie.ru/static/posts/vim-modern-cpp/current-function.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Is you need the complete lightline configuration, see <a href="https://github.com/jubnzv/dotfiles/blob/dd46c2d940c13a0db8d94b02934659018358579a/.config/nvim/init.vim#L435-L462">this snippet</a> and take a look at lightline documentation.</p>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many alternatives provided by popular LSP plugins. For example, <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim">lsp-status.nvim</a> can provide the same information for Neovim’s built-in LSP server.</li>

    <p>When retrieving logs from an application, you are often looking for outliers
(such as a unique error) or what pattern occurs the most. However, defining
patterns manually is time-consuming and requires rigour across projects. In
this series of blog posts, we are going to explore automated Log Pattern
Recognition.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I recently began using <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/patterns/">Datadog Log Pattern</a>
and became addicted to it. Unfortunately, I was not able to find such a feature on
Kibana or a query proxy able to do this analysis. If that does not exist, I
might as well learn more about it and make one!</p>

<p>To my surprise, I did not find as many papers as I thought I would. And the
number of papers with public implementations is even lower. Our series begins
with a paper called <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/Papers/LogMine.pdf">LogMine: Fast Pattern Recognition for Log Analytics</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/trungdq88/logmine">an implementation made by Tony Dinh</a>
that helped me a lot to study LogMine’s behavior.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I searched for anything related to LogMine on Hacker News
and only found Tony Dinh’s submission.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-terms-used-in-this-article">Defining the terms used in this article</h2>

<p>Some terms used in this article can have several meanings. In Logmine’s context,
the terms I use mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>log</code>: a log line (<code>string</code>)
    <div><div><pre><code>12:00:00 - My awesome log
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><code>pattern</code>: Expression extracted by the algorithm (array of <code>field</code>)
    <div><div><pre><code>[&lt;date&gt;, "-", "My", "awesome", "log"]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><code>field</code>: Part of a <code>pattern</code> / Word from a <code>log</code> (Either a fixed value, a wildcard or a <code>variable</code>)</li>
  <li><code>cluster</code>: represents a group of logs that were identified as close to each
others</li>
  <li><code>variable</code>: a user-provided regex used to identify a known format
    <div><div><pre><code>number = \d+
time = \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-logmine">An introduction to LogMine</h2>

<p>The LogMine paper describes a method to parse logs, group them into clusters and
extract patterns without any prior knowledge or supervision. LogMine can be
implemented using MapReduce and works in a single pass over the dataset.</p>

<p>LogMine’s approach to grouping logs roughly works by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parsing logs into patterns</li>
  <li>Grouping patterns into clusters if the <a href="#clustering">distance</a> between them is small</li>
  <li>Merging clusters into a single pattern</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 2 until you are satisfied</li>
</ol>

<p>LogMine classifies fields into three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Fixed value</code>, a field that is constant across all logs in a cluster. This is
detected at the pattern extraction step.</li>
  <li><code>Variable</code>, a field that matches a pattern provided by the user. This is
detected at the pre-processing step.</li>
  <li><code>Wildcard</code>, a field that is not constant across all logs in a cluster. This is
detected at the pattern extraction step.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s illustrate how it works, step by step, using three simple logs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10:00:00 - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
10:30:00 - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
11:11:11 - [ERROR] - An error occurred while disconnecting user 456
12:12:12 - [DEBUG] - User 789 disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will also define a variable <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> that follows the pattern
<code>\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}</code>.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>A good practice would be to define more variables to avoid forming two clusters
from logs with low similarity. For instance, we <strong>should</strong> define <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>
as <code>\d+</code>.</p>

  <p>Depending on the pattern of your logs, defining a common field like <code>&lt;log-level&gt;</code>
as <code>[(DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR)]</code> might end up hiding information. This is
because a <code>WARNING</code> log with an error message might not be that important yet
the same log message with an <code>ERROR</code> level might have the exact information
you would like to highlight.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="log-parsing-and-dense-clusters-identification">Log parsing and dense clusters identification</h3>

<p>The first step is to parse logs into patterns and identify dense clusters. Dense
clusters are clusters where <strong>raw logs are almost identical</strong>.</p>

<p>To do this, we begin by splitting logs into patterns (an array of field). The
separator used by default is any whitespace character.</p>

<p>I stopped at the word <code>while</code> for readability reasons, but there’s no limit to
the number of fields.</p>

<h4 id="identifying-dense-clusters">Identifying dense clusters</h4>

<p>Once this transformation is done, we will reduce these patterns into dense
clusters. Identifying dense clusters can be seen as a special use-case of the
clustering algorithm: we identify clusters but <strong>we skip the pattern extraction
step as these patterns are nearly identical</strong>.</p>

<p>As such, I’ll first introduce the clustering algorithm and the notion of
distance between patterns.</p>

<h3 id="grouping-patterns-into-clusters">Grouping patterns into clusters</h3>

<p>The clustering algorithm takes a list of patterns and identifies patterns that
are close to each other. Both the Tony Dinh’s implementation and the paper uses
the distance defined as:</p>

<p>If the distance between the two patterns is inferior to a threshold <code>MaxDist</code>
defined internally, then the two patterns are considered a member of the same
cluster.</p>

<div>
  <p>This comparison process can be optimized by skipping unnecessary work if the
sum is already greater than our <code>MaxDist</code>.</p>

  <p>This is valid because the elements inside the sum can’t be negative.</p>
</div>

<p>The scoring function proposed in the paper allows for tweaking weights depending
on the field type.</p>

  k2 &amp;\text{if } x=y &amp;\text{and both are variable} \\
  0 &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>In order to keep performance, the scoring function can’t return a negative
value. Therefore <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code> can’t be negative.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>The definition of this scoring function seems to have left some place for interpretation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tony Dinh’s implementation <a href="https://github.com/trungdq88/logmine/blob/a7595c6a0b313b43969199c18465cc8bec3b57d1/src/line_scorer.py#L29">checks for equality</a>
if both value are fixed values.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/logpai/logparser/blob/master/logparser/LogMine/LogMine.py">LogPai’s LogParser</a> dropped the concept of variables and uses k2 to tune wildcards weight</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p>Let’s define <code>k1=1</code> and <code>k2=1</code>, these are the weight used by Tony Dinh’s
implementation and recommended by the original paper.</p>

<h4 id="applying-the-clustering-algorithm">Applying the clustering algorithm</h4>

<p>For this example, I will use the original paper recommendation (<code>MaxDist=0.01</code>).
The MaxDist parameter is used to tune the algorithm sensitivity: the higher
<code>MaxDist</code>, the more patterns are detected.
If <code>MaxDist</code> is too high, patterns are grouped into very large clusters and
pattern extraction become meaningless.</p>

<p>The two logs do not belong to the same cluster as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>11</mn></mfrac><mo>&gt;</mo><mtext>MaxDist</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1 - \frac{3}{11} &gt; \text{MaxDist}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>As we are using <code>MaxDist=0.01</code>, and since the logs in my example are very short,
we will only identify logs that are identical. For this reason, <strong>we can use the
clustering algorithm to identify dense clusters</strong> by skipping the pattern
recognition step.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="pattern-detection">Pattern detection</h3>

<p>In sequential (as opposed to MapReduce) mode, each time a pattern is inserted
in a cluster, LogMine will try to extract patterns from them. LogMine knows
only how to identify two types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed values</li>
  <li>Wildcards</li>
</ul>

<p>While it seems rather strict, remember that the early pattern detection during
tokenization already took care of identifying user-defined patterns.</p>

<div>
  <p>Generating the pattern each time a new pattern is added allows LogMine to only
keep one representative for each cluster. This is a very important factor to
reduce memory usage.</p>

  <p><strong>MapReduce behavior is described later in this article.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>As patterns in the same cluster can have a different number of fields, the paper
uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm">Smith-Waterman</a>
algorithm to align them. The Smith-Waterman is mainly used in Bioinformatics to
align sequences. It is interesting to see an algorithm like this applied to
log pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Once the two patterns are aligned, we compare one by one the field:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the value is equal, we assign a fixed value</li>
  <li>If the value is different, we assign a wildcard pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>The Smith-Waterman algorithm adds placeholders to align logs. These placeholders
are <strong>never equal</strong> to a field value. This means that aligned parts of a log are
always identified as wildcards.</p>

<p>The output of the pattern detection algorithm is a <strong>new list of patterns</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s assume that the previous algorithm identified a cluster with two patterns:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 789 disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To stay consistent with how they were presented earlier, we will call them

<h4 id="result-of-applying-the-smith-waterman-algorithm">Result of applying the Smith-Waterman algorithm</h4>

<p>Because examples in this article would have gotten very complex, I decided to
not use non-aligned logs in my examples. However, you might be curious as to how
the Smith-Waterman works.</p>

<p>On the implementation, LogMine would have aligned the two following patterns by
adding a <code>None</code> value in a field. For instance:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 has disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>would become:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 &lt;None&gt; disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 has disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
  <p><strong>The Smith-Waterman does not understand patterns</strong>. The Smith-Waterman uses
the same scoring function as the clustering algorithm. As such, if two fields
are not equal, there is no guarantee that the placeholder will be inserted
properly.</p>

  <p>If we tweak our previous example to:</p>
  <div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 456 has disconnected
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>The Smith-Waterman algorithm would transform it to:</p>
  <div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User &lt;None&gt; 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 456 has disconnected
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>The alignment was added <strong>before</strong> the user identifier.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="repeat-until-satisfied">Repeat until satisfied</h3>

<p>As the pattern extraction algorithm returns a list of patterns, we can relax
<code>MaxDist</code> and feed this list back into the clustering algorithm.</p>

<p>In <strong>3.4 Hierarchy of Patterns</strong>, the paper describes a process to generate a
hierarchy of possible patterns from very strict to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>SQL is the good old friend that has always worked. It’s something you always come back to, even as Pandas, Julia, Spark, Hadoop, and NoSql attempt to dethrone and replace SQL as the new de-facto data tool.</p><p>Eventually though, they all fail in the face of the consistently reliable SQL. And that's why SQL continues to get asked in interviews. </p><blockquote><strong>A note before we start...</strong></blockquote><blockquote>This guide should be used for anyone who is preparing for an interview in which they know SQL will show up. This guide<strong> is not</strong> a search engine optimized listacle (top 50 sql questions for 2021...really?).</blockquote><blockquote>Rather, this is <strong>real advice and REAL interview questions and exercises </strong>gathered from hundreds of data scientists, engineers, and analysts. We sprinkle exercises throughout this post after learning concepts. Be sure to try attempting the questions first before we walk through solving them. &nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Lastly, if you enjoy this article, <strong>please give us a share</strong> and check out our <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/courses/data-science-course">SQL course</a> that goes a little deeper with more exercises and problems. </blockquote><h2 id="1-why-does-sql-show-up-on-the-interview">1. Why does SQL show up on the interview?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-6.png 600w"></figure><p>SQL allows data scientists and engineers to do a couple of important things.</p><p>One is to <strong>effectively store and retrieve information at scale for analytics</strong>. Even though Google Sheets allows users to easily manipulate and visualize data, it cannot store and scale like a SQL database can. Other popular programs –namely Hadoop and Spark– can scale much further than SQL, but still don’t have a clean and easy-to-use language like SQL to retrieve data efficiently.</p><p>Another great thing about SQL is that understanding the fundamentals bridges the gap between <strong>engineering and data science</strong>. Knowing SQL well gives you a competitive edge over any other candidate, whether you're competing for a position as a product manager, software engineer, or even as a business analyst. Having the skillset to write and pull your own queries is like being a magician that can come up with analyses out of thin air. </p><p>And at the end of the day, you could just be really good at SQL if you wanted to and make tons of money creating ETL jobs or pulling dashboards with efficiency. That's how valued SQL is. </p><h3 id="how-often-does-sql-show-up-in-interviews">How often does SQL show up in interviews?</h3><p>One prevailing question is how often SQL shows up in interviews. </p><p>At Interview Query, we analyzed a dataset of Glassdoor data science interview experiences and responses submitted by our users. The analysis came back that SQL was asked:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/facebook/data-scientist" rel="nofollow">70% of the time during Facebook’s data science interviews</a></li><li><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/Amazon/business-analyst" rel="nofollow">94% of the time during Amazon’s business intelligence and analyst interviews</a></li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-7.png 600w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/image-7.png 1000w, https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2021/01/image-7.png 1262w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/interview-experiences/facebook/data-scientist">Skills tested in Facebook's Data Science Interview as of 2021</a></figcaption></figure><p>Due to its nature in being able to get and manipulate your own data, this is by far the most important skill now towards nabbing a data science position. And while pandas and other languages are useful, note that <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-why-your-data-scientist-interviewer-wont-ask-pandas-questions/" rel="nofollow">SQL will always be the one that matters</a>.</p><h2 id="2-strategies-for-the-live-sql-interview">2. Strategies for the live SQL interview</h2><p>Let's go over the common strategies when tackling SQL interview questions. </p><p><strong>1.Repeat the problem statement</strong></p><p>When presented with a SQL question, listen carefully to the problem description and repeat back what you think the crux of the problem is. The interviewer can then help verify if your understanding is correct.</p><p><strong>2. Understand the edge cases</strong></p><p>If time permits, write out a base case and an edge case to show that you understand the problem. For example: if the interviewer asks you to pull the average number of events per user per day, write out an example scenario where you're verifying this metric. </p><p>Do duplicate events matter? Are we looking at distinct users? These are questions we need to clarify. </p><p><strong>3. Try working backwards if the problem is tricky</strong></p><p>Sketching out what the output of the SQL question will look like is a great strategy towards solving the problem. Usually, if I know what the end output table is supposed to look like, I can work backwards from there on what functions need to be applied before. </p><p>For example, if the output looks like this:</p><pre><code>date        | average events per user
------------+-----------------------
2021-12-01  |  3.5
2021-12-02  |  4.0</code></pre><p>I know that the table before this aggregation would have to look something like this.</p><pre><code>date       | event | user_id
-----------+-------+--------
2021-12-01 | click | 1
2021-12-01 | view  | 1
......</code></pre><p>And then, I can figure out what functions I should use to get to my desired output!</p><p><strong>4. Pattern match to different functions</strong></p><p>As you practice more and more SQL exercises, what you'll find is that many SQL problems follow similar patterns. There are techniques we can use in SQL, like utilizing <code>HAVING</code> on aggregations, self-joins and cross-joins, and applying window functions. But, additionally, we'll see problems that run in a similar vein. </p><p>For example, writing a query to get the second highest salary or writing a query to isolate every fifth purchase by a user utilizes the same <code>RANK</code> function in SQL. </p><p>Understanding the commonalities between questions will help you understand the first step to solving SQL questions faster because you can re-use similar code and stitch together techniques on top of each other. </p><p><strong>5. Start writing SQL</strong></p><p>Finally, it's important to just start writing SQL. It's better to start writing an imperfect solution vs trying to perfectly understand the problem or trying to perfect the solution on the first try. </p><p>Verbalize your assumptions and what you're doing as you write SQL and your interviewer can then be put on the same page as you. </p><h2 id="3-the-7-different-sql-interview-questions">3. The 7 different SQL interview questions</h2><p>SQL questions asked during interviews can vary widely across companies, but even more so across positions. You won't see data scientists asked the same SQL questions as software engineers, and that's because data scientists have to write different types of queries compared to software engineers. </p><p>Generally, each SQL interview question can be bucketed into these categories:</p><ul><li>Definition based SQL questions</li><li>Basic SQL questions</li><li>Reporting and metrics SQL questions</li><li>Analytics SQL questions</li><li>ETL SQL questions</li><li>Database design questions</li><li>Logic based SQL questions</li></ul><p>In this next section, we'll go over which types of SQL questions are expected for different roles and what those different kinds of SQL questions are in detail. </p><h2 id="4-sql-questions-for-data-scientists-and-analysts">4. SQL questions for data scientists and analysts</h2><p>SQL interview questions for data scientists and data analysts will likely show up in three parts of the interview process: the technical round, the take-home challenge, and the onsite interview. </p><p>The technical round and take-home challenge will usually consist of SQL questions <strong>designed to filter out candidates</strong>. Since SQL is commonly used as a filter mechanism for data scientists, it's important to perform well on this part of the interview in order to demonstrate competence. </p><p>Depending on what type of data science role you're interviewing for, you'll find that most SQL questions will be split into these three types:</p><ul><li>Basic SQL Interview Questions</li><li>Reporting and Metrics SQL Interview Questions</li><li>Analytics SQL Interview Questions</li></ul><h3 id="basic-sql-interview-questions">Basic SQL Interview Questions</h3><p>Basic SQL questions are what they sound like. These questions will be generally easy and focus on assessing if you know the basics. </p><p><strong>Definition based SQL questions </strong>are grouped into this category because they're super easy to learn. All you have to do is study a list of definitions of SQL terms and applications. These questions will include understanding the differences between joins, what kinds of aggregations exist, and knowing the basic functions like <code>CASE WHEN</code> or <code>HAVING</code>. </p><p>Basic SQL interview questions that involve a user actually writing a query are slightly different. These will involve getting the <code>COUNT</code> of a table, knowing what the <code>HAVING</code> clause does, and figuring out how to utilize <code>LEFT JOIN</code> versus <code>INNER JOIN</code> to give you the values that you need.</p><blockquote>Read more on the the <a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-three-sql-questions-you-must-know-to-pass/">basic concepts you need to know to pass your data science interview</a> here. </blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.interviewquery.com/blog-three-sql-questions-you-must-know-to-pass/"><div><p>Three SQL Concepts for your Data Scientist Interview</p><p>I’ve interviewed a lot of data scientist candidates and have found there are a a lot of SQL interview questions for data science that eventually boil down to three generalized types of conceptual understandings.</p><p><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/favicon.ico"><span>Interview Query Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.interviewquery.com/content/images/2020/02/sql_join.jpeg"></p></a></figure><p><strong>Basic SQL Concepts to Review</strong></p><ul><li>What's the difference between a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and an <code>INNER JOIN</code>?</li><li>When would you use <code>UNION</code> vs <code>UNION ALL</code>?

        <p>The premise of the movie "Idiocracy" is simple: in the future mankind has de-evolved into morons. Technology does so much for everybody that nobody knows how it all works anymore. &nbsp;If we can't fix it, we're all going to die.</p><p>One character asks the other what he likes, The answer is money.</p><p>"I can't believe you like money too!" the first character says without irony, "We should hang out!"</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/JRJcXbeoSOlkRRzbC7HJ_idiocracy.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The gag here is that of course, most everybody likes money. If you reduce all of your life enough, it's just food, sex, money, and looking cool. But who would want to do that? Over the centuries, humans have created massively-complex societies because everybody has different things they like doing and thinking about, but all of that complexity can be reduced to, well, an idiocracy if you try hard enough.</p><p>The movie, however, is just a joke, right? We would never allow that to happen, of course, because that's not the goal of technology. Technology's goal is to make us better, not dumber.</p><p>Wait one. Is that true? What <em>is</em> the goal of technology, anyway? Has anybody ever clearly stated it?</p><p>Recently I've heard two goals:</p><ol><li>The goal of technology is to become a <strong>brain extension</strong>, <em>helping you to decide what to do</em> and then helping you get it done.</li><li>The goal of technology is to become a <strong>hand-held power tool</strong>, helping you accomplish the things you've <em>already decided to do</em></li></ol><p>That's not the same thing. It turns out the difference is critical.</p><p>The old goal was much simpler: make something people want. I like that goal! It boils down the job of creating technology to the most important parts, need and ability. But was that sustainable? At the end of the day, don't we always end up making some combination of stuff that either helps us <em>make decisions</em> or helps us <em>implement decisions</em> we've already made? And aren't the two fundamentally incompatible in a future society?</p><p>Yelp tells you which restaurant to go to. Your GPS automatically takes you there. These are not just different problems, they're different <em>kinds of problems</em>. Getting from point A to point B is a matter of math and geometry. Which restaurant is the best tonight? You could spend hours debating that with friends.</p><p>If you reduce anything down enough it becomes idiotic. Each piece of technology we deploy can have the goal of helping us do what we've already decided or helping us decide what to do. The first option leaves the thinking up to us. The second option "helps" us think.</p><figure><iframe width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZHCVyllnck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>You like money too? Wow! I like money! We should hang out!</p><p>Human brains are not computers. Brains are designed to help us survive and pass on our genes using the minimum amount of energy available. If the GPS takes me where I'm going, I don't need to know how to use maps anymore. So I stop knowing how to use maps. Dump those neurons, they're not needed. If Yelp picks the restaurants for me enough, I stop having nuanced preferences about restaurants. That energy expenditure is no longer needed for survival and reproduction. Dump those neurons. Over time people stop caring about the tiny details of what the difference is between a good and a great restaurant. Yelp handles that.</p><p>For some folks, who cares? It's food. Go eat it. For other folks, picking the right place can be a serious undertaking, worthy of heavy thought and consideration. But if over the years apps like Yelp boil all of that down to four or five stars, then our collective brain is not going to bother with it. Human brains are not computers. If computers do the work for us, we turn off those neurons and save energy.</p><p>Meanwhile, on social media there's currently this huge discussion. One bunch of folks says that social media is being overbearing in its censorship of fringe and sometimes hateful opinions. The other bunch of folks says social media is a festering sore full of people who are ugly, hateful, and abusive to those weakest among us. The community has to set standards.</p><p>There doesn't have to be a right and wrong here. I think the crucial thing to to understand that both sides can be entirely correct. We are dealing with the same kind of question.</p><p>All three of these topics -- whether humanity is becoming idiots or not, what the ultimate goal of technology is or should be, and how social media should work -- are intricately related. They're related because of this: <em>the platform is the enemy</em>.</p><p>The minute we create a platform for something, whether it's rating movies, tracking projects, or chatting with friends about work, as that platform takes over mindshare, <em>the assumption becomes that this is a solved problem</em>.</p><p>The telephone was great. Once we had the telephone, people didn't have to worry about how to talk to people far away anymore. Just pick up the phone. Solved problem.</p><p>Facebook is great. Once we had Facebook, people didn't have to worry about how to interact with their friends in a social setting anymore. Just click on the little FB notification (Which seems to be always flashing for some reason to get my attention) Solved problem?</p><p>But these are entirely different things! With the phone, I know who I want to call and why. I push buttons and we are connected. The tech helps me do what I've already decided to do. With Facebook, on the other hand, they get paid to show me things in a certain order. The premise is that I'm waiting (or "exploring" if you prefer) until I find something to interact with. The phone is a tool for me to use. I am the tool Facebook is using. I am no longer acting. I am reacting.</p><p>And even if they weren't paid, interacting with friends socially is an extremely complex affair. What kind of mood are they in? What's their life history? What things are bad to bring up? How does their body language look? Facebook's gimmick is "Hey, we've reduced all of this to bits and bytes, and we'll even show you what bits and bytes to look at next!"</p><p>Solved problem.</p><p>Many, many people do not use the internet, the internet uses them. And this percentage is constantly growing.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/9EBNeUmSy6TMDUpKTLL6_terminator-robot.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Just like the restaurant example, maybe that's fine. I have friends, I have opinions, who cares? It's all idle chat anyway.</p><p>That logic can be true for a bunch of things, but can't be true for <em>everything</em>. Otherwise, at some point 100 years from now, we're comparing our life values and end up saying something like "I like money too". Everything can't all be reduced down to the lowest common denominator. If it does, we all die.</p><p>Life is not a bit or byte, a number to be optimized. It's meaning we define ourselves, in ways we should not quantize.</p><p>Platforms, by their very nature, constantly send out the subtle message: <em>This is a solved problem. No further effort on your part is required here. No thinking needed.</em> Platforms resist change. They resist their own evolution by subtly poisoning the discussion before it even starts.</p><p>Are restaurant choices more or less important than which movie to watch tonight? There's no right or wrong answer to these questions. We have nice categories like restaurants and movies because currently people consider those things to be different kinds of choices. But why? If the algorithm is king, why shouldn't an algorithm determine both of those things for me? And if it does, why should I bother with worrying about which category is which?</p><p>Human brains are not computers. Let the platform decide. Energy not needed. Dump those neurons.</p><p>This is the more important point. It's not that the platforms turn what might be complex things into simple numbers, or even that they monetize attention. It's that by turning everything into numbers, over time they destroy the distinction between the categories entirely. Platforms are the enemy because they resist analysis in the areas they dominate.</p><p>Platforms turn into settled fact things that should be open for debate, like whether or not Taco Bell is a Mexican restaurant, or whether Milo is an artist with something useful to tell us. (I'm going with "no" and "no" for both of these.) More dangerously, they do the work of deciding <em>what categories various things go into</em>. This category over here is important. That category over there is not. We all make these decisions, and they're all different, and the categories each of us pays careful attention to and loves obsessing about are all different, and because we all have different viewpoints and priorities humankind advances in thousands of directions simultaneously. We survive. We evolve.</p><p>Twitter has to decide whether PERSON_X can speak or not because on the Twitter platform, that question has to have a yes or no answer based on the person. Twitter's category for deciding who can speak is "who is that?" Is that the right category for social conversations? For political conversations? For conversations about philosophy? Math? Who knows? Who cares? Twitter has decided. Solved problem.</p><p>Everybody has different things they like doing and thinking about. Different conversations and audiences have different criteria. Some problems should never be solved. Or rather more directly, some problems should never have a universal answer.</p><p>An aside: We see the same thing in programming. One bunch of folks creates various platforms in order to do the thinking for another bunch of folks. Sometimes these platforms take off and become industry standards. That's quite rare, however. Most of the time we end up training morons who can weakly code against the platform but can't reason effectively about the underlying architecture or reason for the platform to exist in the first place. In our desire to help, we harm the very people we're trying to assist -- by subtly giving them the impression that this is a solved problem. Programmers are just a decade or so ahead of the rest of us.</p><p>Popular platforms aren't just a danger economically because they control commerce. They're not just a danger politically because they selectively control and amplify political discourse. They're an extinction-level, existential danger to humans because they prevent people from seriously considering what kinds of categories are important in …</p></div></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This year Google will stop supporting and remove Google Hangouts. Google Hangouts, if you're not aware, was Google's replacement for their chat program Google Talk. Google Talk was a XMPP-based chat client that was available for all users of Google services. Google Hangouts was rolled out around the same time as Google+, and was a wrapper for many different Google services (phone, video chats, and Hangouts on Air). What was nice about it was that anyone that you knew the GMail address of had access to Google Hangouts. This meant that many of my friends had Hangouts access. JoDee and I used Hangouts for much of our IM communication. Unfortunately for whatever reason Google decided to remove yet another of the things that I liked about Google services, and proves once again that Google can't be trusted with any social platform.</p>
<p>Today I downloaded the "Google Takeout" of Hangouts and removed all of the old chats. There were a lot of nice memories in there, and now they can live in a collection of photos and one long JSON dump file that I'll probably never read again.</p>
<p>If you want to find me I'm on Signal and Quicksy (an XMPP-based service using phone numbers and OMEMO for encryption). If you have my phone number you can use these services to get a hold of me. I'm still on IRC and have accounts on other platforms. But what seems a constant is that communication will be fractured over multiple platforms and the dream of having one application doing everything well dies on July, 2021. And the irritation of having yet-another-platform to talk to that one person is the reality we'll all have to deal with until something better comes along. Nothing is perfect and everything is terrible.</p>
<p>RIP Hangouts. You helped me not have to think about messaging.</p>
