<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

While the NLP community had success with <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Language Modeling</a> and Translation using LSTM networks <span data-cites="hochreiter_long_1997">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)</span> and Encoder-Decoder architectures <span data-cites="sutskever_sequence_2014">Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le (2014)</span>, it was not until the invention of the <strong>attention</strong> mechanism <span data-cites="bahdanau_neural_2016">Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2016)</span> that things started to work spectacularly well.</p> <p>When processing language, each token, which could be a character, a word, or something in between, is fed into a recurrent network, such as an LSTM, which maintains a kind of memory of previously processed inputs. In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer. The optimizer is responsible for figuring out how to adjust the parameters of the network to make it learn the objective. Most optimizers are <a href="https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/">based on variations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</a>. However, many of these optimizers contain tunable parameters such as a learning rate themselves. Finding the right settings for a specific problem not only reduces training time, but can also lead to better results due to finding a better local minimum of the loss function.</p> <p>Big resarch labs often ran expensive hyperparameter searches that came up with complex learning rate schedules to get the best out of simple but hyperparameter-sensitive optimizers such as SGD.

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain.

<p>Galaksija was to be in Yugoslavia what Commodore and Sinclair were in the west. Whether it succeeded or not, its deceptively simple design can still teach us a lot of interesting tricks on how to make a usable computer and operating system with as few transistors and bits as possible.

<div data-url="https://kislayverma.com/organizations/independence-autonomy-and-too-many-small-teams/" data-title="Independence, autonomy, and too many small teams">
<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-300x205.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-768x526.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1070x732.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size.jpg 1505w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1024x701.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-300x205.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-768x526.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size-1070x732.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dev-prod-with-team-size.jpg 1505w"></figure>
<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1024x809.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-300x237.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-768x607.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions-1070x845.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/narrow-missions.jpg 1484w"></figure>
<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>
<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-300x102.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-768x262.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1536x523.jpg 1536w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams-1070x365.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sequential-teams.jpg 1916w"></figure>
<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly performing plant.</p>

<br><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/i.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="11"><span size="+1">n
October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/selections/charlotte/charlotte1.htm">Charlotte</a>.</span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hook="post-description"><article><div><div data-rce-version="7.15.3"><div dir="ltr"><div><p id="viewer-foo"><span>I’ve recently co-founded a startup, and after working so long in more mature enterprises with diverse toolchains, it was actually massively educational to return to first steps and figure out what our critical needs were, balanced with essentially zero budget. As we’ve grown and raised money, we’ve graduated in some areas to other tools, but I wanted to share what we felt were the absolute can’t-live-without-tools for a team building SaaS software. I don’t have any vested interest in any of these apps, they’re just the ones we settled on as we spun up, they worked perfectly, integrated where we needed, and were either free or very cheap.</span></p><ol><li id="viewer-33kep"><p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Google Apps</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>.</span></strong><span> We knew going in we’d want to centralize authentication around Google SSO, and didn’t want to have to go back later and move everything over after setting up simple sign-in. A bonus for us has been how strong Google now plays with Microsoft docs - when we receive Keypoint presos, Excel sheets, Word docs like MSAs etc., we’re able to do everything in Google and send it back, and not a one of us have a MS license. And an added unexpected bonus has been that Google Meet (or whatever its called this week) has worked surprisingly well for our internal meetings and standups etc. And at $6 per user pm, it fit our budget.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-fdt4q"><p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Slack</strong></u></span></a><span>. No-brainer. Used free for months, and only started paying once we wanted to bring in external users etc., and even then it’s insanely cheap for the value we derive.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-7irdv"><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>AWS</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re building on AWS, and never really considered using anything else. There are a number of ways to get your hands on AWS credits too, some banks (eg </span><a href="https://www.svb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>SVB</u></span></a><span>) offer startup credits, as well as some credit cards etc. - we found that by leveraging our networks and partners we were able to get most of our AWS usage free for the first year, which is massive when there’s no revenue.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4mdtf"><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Jira</strong></u></span></a><span>. We’re all Atlassian old-timers, so didn’t really consider anything else, and it being free to start again matches our budget. We have looked at a few other issue trackers eg Clubhouse since starting up to figure out integrations, and tbh just aren’t seeing that anything yet comes close to the power of Jira’s workflows, issue states, etc. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-48g4s"><p><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Github</strong></u></span></a><strong><span>/</span></strong><a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Bitbucket</strong></u></span></a><span>. Not much to say here, you gotta put your code somewhere and we’re using both for various projects. And they’re only getting more free by the day. </span></p></li><li id="viewer-576uc"><p><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Quickbooks</strong></u></span></a><span>. I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now. Stripe integration with our app was brain-dead simple, and the cost is peanuts compared to the value we get, especially given they only get paid when we do.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-4fpta"><p><a href="https://reclaim.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Reclaim</strong></u></span></a><span>. We didn’t know we needed Reclaim until we did. Startup life began as a welcome return to meeting-free days with time to work and GSD… for like two weeks. Reclaim works perfectly and noise-lessly to manage our calendars, and is free.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-34v18"><p><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Miro</strong></u></span></a><span>. From day one, our team was remote, with team members ranging from San Francisco to Boulder to Slovenia. I was initially suspicious of a whiteboarding app that might whistle me back to the kind of horrid multi-day “planning offsite” navel-gazing exercises that I’ve come to dread, but we’ve found Miro to be awesome for working thru ideas with remote team members. And again, free. Amazing.</span></p></li></ol><p id="viewer-b9h22"><span>That’s it, that’s what you need to start. Everything a SaaS startup needs to get up and running, for under $100 a month. </span></p><p id="viewer-61iv0"><span>--- </span></p><p id="viewer-8hurk"><span><strong>Epilogue</strong></span> </p><p id="viewer-dpf11"><span>As we’ve grown, there are other apps we’ve added or replaced. We needed a CI tool so we went with CircleCI. We eventually outgrew QBO for payroll once we added health insurance benefits and international payments so went to Rippling for that portion, still keeping QBO for everything else. We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month. It’s a great age to build a company with the wealth of inexpensive, amazing tools on the market.</span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <p>Large projects and mono repos can be a pain to navigate. <strong>gg</strong>
is a small script I use almost everyday to make it easier.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with WordPress —&nbsp;or really most CMSes for
that matter — the base application configuration, themes,
plugins, etc. are typically given their own sub directories to
help isolate them. For WordPress development, I use the
<a href="https://roots.io/">Roots</a> stack and it does a great job of
making the project structure relavant, however, since it is
still WordPress, the project structure is not exactly flat.
Often I’ll need to jump to Trellis’ directory to start the
development VM, run a deploy, or update an environment’s
configuration, but shortly after jump back to the directory of
the theme or plugin I’m working on. Remembering the level of
depth and simply writing out the path can be a tedious and
erroneous task.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h2>
<p><strong>gg</strong> is a very simple Bash script I wrote to make is 100%
easier to jump between directories in a large project. Here’s a
short clip of it in action with a Roots project:</p>

<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0SjUNTfzKk" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-the-script">Breaking down the script</h2>
<p>There are a few requirements you will need before you get started:</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>: <code>git</code>, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"><code>ag</code></a></p>
<p>You most likely should be able to achieve the same thing with
built-in tools or alternatives to <code>fd</code> and <code>ag</code> (maybe even
<code>fzf</code>), but for this tutorial, I’ll use the tools listed above.
One note before diving into the script, I do have the following
set for my FZF default command:</p>
<pre><span>export </span><span>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>='</span><span>ag -g ""</span><span>'
</span></pre>
<p>The script itself is pretty simple. There are two parts to it.
First, if we want to see all of the directories within our
project, even if we are already in a nested directory, we will
need to jump to the root of the Git repo. Luckily, it is
relatively easy to do this with Git. Using Git’s <code>rev-parse</code>
subcommand with the <code>--show-toplevel</code> flag, we can get “the
absolute path of the top-level-directory.” Since this is useful
in itself, but still a tad cumbersome to remember and write out,
we’ll create a function for it:</p>
<pre><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>If you already have a set of Git-aliases, you might find naming
conflicts with the ones I will create in this tutorial and in
that case, or in the case you don’t like the names I’ve picked,
you will need to use a different name.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an easy way to find a sub-directory.
If you’ve ever used a fuzzy-search tool, you’ll know that that
they are pretty great. Knowing the fuzzy-search capabilities of
<code>fzf</code>, I know I can do something like <code>cd $(fzf)</code> to almost
achieve what we’re looking for, however, that finds directories
and files, the latter of which we do not need. Luckily, we can
use a finder tool with <code>fzf</code> to get what we need. I’ll use <code>fd</code>
to achieve this:</p>
<pre><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>We are telling <code>fd</code> to just find directories, follow symbolic
links, allow hidden directories, but exclude the <code>.git</code>
directory. Luckily, <code>fd</code> already respects <code>.gitignore</code> so we do
not need to worry about dependencies or build files polluting
our search selection. Also, we are making it fancy with a
preview window of the selected directory’s contents.</p>
<p>I prefer to leave these as separate functions in case I want to
just jump to the Git repo root or jump to a sub-directoy within
the current directory. For the final <code>gg</code> command, we can just
use an alias:</p>
<pre><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>
<p>And that’s it. Here’s the full and final script:</p>
<pre><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to Git root
</span><span>gr</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`</span><span>git</span><span> rev-parse</span><span> --show-toplevel</span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to sub-directory
</span><span>gd</span><span>() {
</span><span>  </span><span>cd </span><span>`
</span><span>    </span><span>fd --type</span><span> d</span><span> --hidden --follow --exclude</span><span> .git \
</span><span>    </span><span>| </span><span>fzf --preview </span><span>"</span><span>ls -Ap {}</span><span>"
</span><span>  </span><span>`
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span># Go to a directory within the current Git repository
</span><span>alias </span><span>gg</span><span>="</span><span>gr &amp;&amp; gd</span><span>"
</span></pre>

The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p>Early on at Compression.ai, our main image compression algorithm used to look a lot more like most other Machine Learning (ML) based image compression algorithms — an auto-encoder. We had a branched neural network as the encoder, a branched neural network as the decoder, and an entropy coding module sandwiched in the middle. We then trained this whole network using the 1M ImageNet dataset, which contain just over 1 million images.</p>
<p>It was super simple. And it worked! Our model compressed images at 0.8 bit-per-pixel (bpp), while keeping the MS-SSIM over 0.99. Comparing against all the published work at the time, we were at the top in terms of visual quality to compression ratio. It was great, and we thought we had something.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*SlUT3YbVlYw0N6HF" alt="A typical auto-encoder" width="337" height="226"></p><p>Figure 1: A typical auto-encoder</p>
</div>
<p>But trying to get people to adapt a new file format was way harder than we originally thought, it was nearly impossible. No one wants to download a codec (that handles decompression) to open their images, even if it’s anything open source – let alone a proprietary one. We figured this out early on, and knew that if we were to make something substantial in the compression space, it had to be about taking an existing standard and improving on it, rather than creating a completely new one.</p>
<p>JPEG, first introduced to the world almost 3 decades ago, is still the most widely used image compression standard in the world. It is surprisingly simple, yet extremely effective. We figured if we needed to create something for the masses, it needed to be JPEG. This is when we began our work in improving JPEG with ML. In this blog post, I’ll detail the process we took, and how we ultimately created the best image compression algorithm there is.</p>
<h2>Enter JPEG</h2>
<p>To really understand how we can bring ML to JPEG, we’d need to start with JPEG itself and understand how JPEG compresses images. For a given image, the following explains how the JPEG algorithm works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the image is broken in to 8×8, non-overlapping blocks</li>
<li>Then for each 8×8 block, the algorithm:
<ul>
<li>Converts the color space to YUV</li>
<li>Performs subsampling on the UV channels (In case for 4:2:0 for example)</li>
<li>Applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)</li>
<li>Quantizes using a Q-Table</li>
<li>Entropy codes to obtain a bit string</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lastly, this bit string (each per block of 8×8), together with metadata (such as the Q-Table) comprises the JPEG file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JPEG decoder, on the other hand, performs the above in reverse to reconstruct the image. If we take the output after quantization, perform de-quantization (basically by multiplying element-wise with the Q-Table) followed by an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), and convert the color space back to RGB, then we end up with 8×8 blocks of the original image. To go into more depth into how the JPEG compression works, refer to the following articles:</p>
<ol>
<li>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-jpg-works-a4dbd2316f35/</li>
<li>https://medium.com/breaktheloop/jpeg-compression-algorithm-969af03773da</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enter Machine Learning</h2>
<p>So how do we go about improving this process with Machine Learning? When you take a step back, you realize that the above computational steps can be executed in tensor-flowy fashion.&nbsp; Take an image, say of dimensions (a, b, 3), and create 8×8 patches of it (N, 8, 8, 3), N being the number of patches. (It helps if the image dimensions are divisible by 8, otherwise zero-padding would do. Anyway, details don’t matter much here, let’s focus image flow for now).&nbsp; On each 8×8 patch, we apply DCT, followed by a quantization step. A dequantization step&nbsp; followed by IDCT will yield back the original color space.</p>
<p>Now, if we had trainable parameters, we can imagine this process as a flow of a tensor, and use a framework like TensorFlow to code the model. You can then start training it with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and optimize the network for MS-SSIM, for example.</p>
<p>Quantization in the JPEG algorithm consists of two operations. The first is to divide the numbers element-wise using a table commonly referred to as a Q-Table. This division is then followed by rounding to the nearest integer (to convert from floating-point numbers after DCT to integers in order to save space).</p>
<p>What we realized was, all the meaningful compression in the JPEG algorithm happens at this Quantization step – it is when the output of the DCT gets divided by the Q-Table. If we then use a neural network to approximate the best Q-Table possible, while guaranteeing a minimum MS-SSIM score, we have a winner.</p>
<p>Compression.ai’s newest JPEG compression engine was built using this concept. At its heart, we have a neural network outputting the best Q-Table guaranteeing the smallest output files size for the highest MS-SSIM score, tailored for each and every input image. A super fast implementation of the traditional JPEG compression algorithm is then used to create the final output image file.</p>
<p>So there you go. There’s a peak into the machine learning side of our algorithms.</p>
<p id="b8c5" data-selectable-paragraph="">At Compression.ai, we develop spectral compression solutions, such as the above, in addition to 16-bit greyscale video compression, and <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Lists/CCSDS%201230P11/123x0p11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">CCSDS-123 compliant hyperspectral lossless data compression</a>.

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Aaron Tilley of the Wall Street Journal has an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-forces-businesses-to-confront-cloud-computing-costs-11595849519">interesting piece</a> (paywalled) today that speaks to one of the challenges that businesses are facing on the pandemic related technology front. The net of it is that companies are spending more and more on cloud costs, sometimes independent of their business outcomes. It doesn't compute long term. <br></p><p>More importantly, we think this moment signals a shift, with the pendulum swinging in the direction of the private cloud. The direction of repatriation. &nbsp;<br></p><p>We are not suggesting that the public cloud is a phenomenon. On the contrary, it has established itself as one of the foundational components of the enterprise technology stack. It is a multi-billion dollar business for nearly a dozen companies, led most famously by the exceptionally talented and driven team at Amazon. Their web services business generates $40 billion per year, and while the S3 business represents the lion’s share of the revenue, there are valuable services that continue to proliferate, reducing AWS’s exposure to that line of business.</p><p>Why did the cloud become so ubiquitous so quickly?</p><ol><li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – AWS and others made it simple to solve problems. Need compute? Done. Need storage? Done. Want to add to that storage? Done. Want to analyze the data inside that storage? Done. The public cloud dramatically reduced the friction associated with cloud and shifted the balance of power to the developer community and away from IT.</li><li><strong>Elasticity</strong> – The public cloud offered a novel model: pay for what you need, when you need it. The concept of spinning up storage and compute and then spinning it down was entirely new and offered an attractive alternative to sunk costs and over-provisioning.</li><li><strong>A Microservices Mentality</strong> – One of the least appreciated implications of the cloud is that it came ready with an unbelievably rich catalog of applications, services and APIs that dramatically accelerated the development of data rich applications.</li></ol><p>While these themes powered the rise of the public cloud, they are not fundamentally competitive differentiators. That is to say, that the same attributes can be replicated on other public cloud options and more notably the private cloud, with a number of other benefits. Specifically, on the private cloud you get:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Security</strong> – While the public cloud offers an increasing array of security options, it suffers from some key gaps, namely complexity and management.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> – As we have noted in many of our <a href="https://blog.min.io/tag/benchmarks/">benchmark papers</a>, the public cloud is plenty fast. Object storage is the primary storage platform in the public cloud for a reason: it offers superior throughput, albeit higher latency. For data-rich applications and analytics, this is the ideal tradeoff. In the private cloud, proximity comes into play and delivers better performance than the public cloud at a fraction of the cost. This is a function of how expensive bandwidth is compared to storage.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> – Ultimately, the public cloud, for all its benefits, doesn’t deliver cost saving at scale. This is what is driving the <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3532030/cloud-repatriation-rescues-cios-from-mounting-costs.html">repatriation phenomenon</a> for large enterprises and keeping other ones <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-americas-350-million-internal-cloud-bet-striking-payoff-2019-10?IR=T">out of the cloud.</a> The ease of spinning up an instance, coupled with the ease of forgetting about it, results in massive bills. If your enterprise is dealing with petabytes the economics favor the private cloud.</li></ol><p>Having said that there are some good reasons a company <em><strong>should</strong></em> move the public cloud. The answer is to learn. To develop cloud-native muscle. To change the DNA of your organization.</p><p>Once you have achieved that, you come back to the private cloud – to run your business at scale. Let’s explore that concept a little further:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Out of Your Comfort Zone</strong> – There are a number of skills you will never learn from sliding another blade into the rack and seeing it come up on your “single pane of glass”. This is not an insult to IT admins, as they have significant amounts of tribal knowledge that are immensely valuable. Further, the success of the blade vendors is predicated on making things simple. None of those blade vendors want to talk about Kubernetes, containers or programming skills or databases - but those are the components of the public cloud and they have to be mastered. What better place to do it than the cloud, where sampling different software solutions is as easy as cruising the marketplace.</li><li><strong>Cloud-Native Muscle</strong> – The cloud-native mentality is fundamentally different from the traditional IT mentality. The traditional IT mentality is about hardware appliances, integration testing, validation and labs. The cloud-native mentality is about software, applications, containerization, orchestration, APIs and microservices. The cloud-native way is to rapidly assemble infrastructure, applications and workflows, and then deploy that in the service of a business problem. The cloud-native way is the future. Kubernetes is the dominant model in the build/package/deploy framework. It was designed for the cloud-native world that we now live in. These are the skills that a modern enterprise needs to develop. Learning them in the traditional IT framework makes no sense. Moving to the cloud demands that the organization master the cloud-native skill set because that is the only skill set that works there.</li><li><strong>Understand Scaling</strong> – In the public cloud, simple scales, failure domains are kept small and building blocks represent the way things are built. Massive, monolithic systems don’t exist. Massive systems exist, just ask the CIOs with 8-figure AWS bills, but they are composed of smaller blocks. The basic premise of cloud-native architecture, whether it is for compute or storage, is to consume resources in small, discrete chunks. As you scale, you add additional instances and pack them as densely as possible in your infrastructure instead of scaling one instance up infinitely.</li><li><strong>Internalize Simplicity</strong> – One of the great gifts of the cloud is simplicity: the ability to <a href="https://min.io/pricing">start with a credit card</a>, to provision infrastructure with a click of the mouse, to add products and services. Simple wins in the cloud. For too long, IT used complexity as a method of control. Only certain, credentialed and certified individuals were given the keys to the castle. In the cloud, simple wins. If your app or service is simple to provision and deploy, more people will adopt it. Like water, consumers choose the path of least resistance. Simple does not mean lacking in features or power. Simple is often more powerful than complex – it just takes more effort to deliver the experience. Simplicity democratizes data. Every organization wants to democratize data – they need to learn its secrets and apply them at scale.</li></ul><p>Good? Now apply at scale.<br></p><p>As noted, the public cloud is an amazing place to learn but not an amazing place to scale – unless of course, you are the landlord (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba). The place to scale is on the private cloud, using the same technologies that you used on the public cloud: S3 storage, dense compute, high-speed networking, Kubernetes, containers and microservices. <br></p><p>This offers the ideal mix of operational costs, flexibility and control. It is true that you will take on CapEx, but by starting small and taking advantage of key cloud lessons (elasticity and scaling by components) enterprises can minimize the initial outlay and maximize the operationational savings.<br></p><p>The net effect is to drive superior TCO and ROI through the private cloud. <br></p><p>So go to the public cloud and learn the “way of the cloud” then apply it on-prem. That is where the economics, control and security reign supreme. <br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've wanted to join YC for the last 8 years. I've applied to and been rejected by YC three times.</p><p>But when we got into YC with <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a>, we turned it down. Here’s why…</p><h2 id="yc-as-an-employee">YC as an Employee</h2><p>I first learned about YC in 2012 from <a href="https://twitter.com/zebulgar">a friend</a> who was obsessed with startups. Soon, all of my smartest friends were dropping out of school to do YC. In 2014, I joined them by bailing on an internship to work for <a href="http://picnichealth.com/">Picnic Health</a> as they went through YC S14.</p><p>That summer I lived in a house in Redwood City with the rest of the team. YC forced us to focus and make progress each week. This culminated in Demo Day which allowed us to raise a seed round without much real traction.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_8nvbj2oFDnwe9iRc.jpg" alt="The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF."><figcaption>The Picnic Health team after graduating from a house in Redwood City to a real office in the Mission District of SF.</figcaption></figure><p>At my mom's urging, I left Picnic Health to finish college, but that summer left a lasting impression. After graduating and joining <a href="http://benchling.com/">Benchling</a> (another YC startup), I watched jealously as friends started companies and got into YC.</p><h2 id="rejected-rejected-rejected-accepted">Rejected, Rejected, Rejected, Accepted</h2><p>After leaving Benchling to start my own company, I quickly learned that starting a company was much harder than expected. I applied to YC and got rejected. Rinse and repeat. I ended up starting 3 companies and getting rejected from YC three times.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_eGdhBVmpHcqwD4nj.png" alt="Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with Scooter Map."><figcaption>Here I am after interviewing for (and getting rejected from) YC with <a href="https://scootermap.com/">Scooter Map</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>This March, as COVID spread in the US, I stayed up late talking with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/danqing_liu">Danqing</a> about what we could do to help. From these conversations, we built <a href="http://zmurl.com/">ZmURL</a> to help <a href="https://zmurl.com/whit2">a friend of mine</a> sell tickets to her Zoom Yoga classes.</p><p>In just a week, ZmURL went from an idea to being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/how-to-prevent-zoombombing/">featured on TechCrunch</a>. To keep up with the growth, we focused on building product 7 days a week. For one weekend we took a break to lift our heads up, talk about the future, and to apply to YC.</p><p>To my surprise, after getting rejected three times, we got into YC for the current batch. Even more surprisingly, after weighing our options, we decided to turn down YC.</p><p>I realized that we applied to YC just because it was "the thing to do" and that YC is no longer the right fit for every startup. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_dTo3agVed4ANcClE.png" alt="The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever."><figcaption>The ZmURL team in NYC meeting in person for the second time ever.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-benefits-of-yc">The Benefits of YC</h2><p>Before explaining why we turned down YC, it's helpful to know what makes YC so awesome. From going thru YC with Picnic Health, YC helped us with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — Learn how to startup. Attend inspirational dinners.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — You're forced to deliver results every week. Compete with your batchmates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network</strong> — Bond with other smart founders. Reach out to YC alums</p></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — YC is cool, it's cool to be part of YC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you are selling to startups, YC is full of them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — Demo Day builds buzz and FOMO.</p></li></ul><h2 id="yc-without-yc">YC Without YC</h2><p>Today, many of these benefits can be gained without joining YC while other aspects of YC have gotten worse due to the increased the batch size.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Coursework</strong> — YC has open sourced <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> and <a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/">Startup Class</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accountability</strong> — Write a <a href="https://victor.pont.is/article/weekly-update">weekly update</a> to friends or post your progress to Twitter.</p></li><li><div><p><strong>Network</strong> — Join an early stage startup. Meet interesting people online.</p><p>I was able to build an invaluable network of mentors over the past 5 years working at startups and starting companies in San Francisco. I've made interesting friends from posting on Twitter and reaching out just to chat with interesting people. (See Tweet below.)</p></div></li><li><p><strong>Branding</strong> — You can build a personal brand by writing online, but the YC brand is very good.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sales Leads</strong> — If you aren't selling to startups, you don't benefit as much from YC’s network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fundraising</strong> — From the founders I've talked to, the first remote Demo Day failed. This could have been due to COVID, so it'll be interesting to see how the next Demo Day goes...</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://assets.contents.io/asset_3qWItqVzC2aoeI6N.png" alt="I've met friends, investors, and mentors on Twitter.

YC is a great fit for you if are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A Tech Outsider</strong> — YC helps you meet other founders and can introduce you to any VC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Selling to Startups</strong> — Stripe, Segment, Gusto, and Brex grew quickly by selling to other YC companies. As a YC founder, it's easy to reach out to alums and pitch them, although this is getting worse as the large batch sizes dilute the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hungry for Prestige</strong> — YC used to be for outsiders. "Why would you start a company instead of work for Google?" But now joining YC is cool, so it's a valuable stop on the Harvard → McKinsey → MBA trajectory. (This has also contributed to YC's dilution.)</p></li></ul><p>While increasing the batch size is the right thing for YC (and for the world), it's made the experience worse for founders who get less facetime with partners and end up directly competing with batchmates. While YC told us there wouldn't be competitors in our batch, we've already seen at least 3 very similar companies in the current YC batch...</p><p>After weighing our options, we decided to skip YC and to try to raise a seed round. I'll talk about how that went in my next post...</p></div></div>]]>

			<p>The most powerful books reach beyond their pages—beyond those few hours in which they’re read—and indelibly transform how serious readers see the world. Few books achieve such transcendent impact, yet given their physical constraints, it’s remarkable that any do. As a medium, books have no direct means of communicating with readers over time. The physical text is stuck on the page, generally read linearly and continuously in a few sittings.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat1.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To be transformed by a book, readers must do more than absorb information: they must bathe in the book’s ideas, relate those ideas to experiences in their lives over weeks and months, try on the book’s mental models like a new hat. Unfortunately, readers must drive that process for themselves. Authors can’t easily guide this ongoing sense-making: their words are stuck on pages which have already been read. How might one create a medium which does the job of a book, but which escapes a book’s shackled sense of time? How might one create <em>timeful texts</em>—texts with affordances extending the authored experience over weeks and months, texts which continue the conversation with the reader as they slowly integrate those ideas into their lives?</p>
			
			<p>Each year, hundreds of thousands of students study <em>Molecular Biology of the Cell</em>. The text presents endless facts and figures, but its goal is not simply to transmit reference material. The book aspires to convey a strong sense of how to think like a cell biologist—a way of looking at questions, at phenomena, and at oneself. For example, it contains nuanced discussions of microscopy techniques, but readers can’t meaningfully try on those ways of thinking while they’re reading. Readers must carry this book’s ideas into their daily interactions in the lab, watching for moments which relate to the exercises or which give meaning to the authors’ advice.<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat1.png" role="presentation"> This model of change is brittle: the right situation must arise while the book is still fresh in readers’ minds; they must notice the relevance of the situation; they must remember the book’s details; they must reflect on their experience and how it relates to the book’s ideas; and so on.</p>
			<p>As we consider alternative approaches, we can find inspiration in the world’s most transformative books. Consider texts like the Bible and the Analects of Confucius. People integrate ideas from those books into their lives over time—but not because authors designed them that way. Those books work because they’re surrounded by rich cultural activity. Weekly sermons and communities of practice keep ideas fresh in readers’ minds and facilitate ongoing connections to lived experiences. This is a powerful approach for powerful texts, requiring extensive investment from readers and organizers. We can’t build cathedrals for every book. Sophisticated readers adopt similar methods to study less exalted texts, but most people lack the necessary skills, drive, and cultural contexts. How might we design texts to more widely enable such practices?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat2.png" role="presentation">
			<p>Guided meditation smartphone apps offer a promising design approach. Meditation’s insights unfold slowly. Aspirants are typically advised to practice daily. Over weeks and months, they may begin to experience the world differently. Some concepts in meditation make no sense if you still can’t perceive your breath clearly, so they’re best introduced later. A book on meditation isn’t well-suited to this kind of slow unfurling: much of it may not make sense initially; readers will need to re-read it again and again as their practice progresses. But a guided meditation app’s experience is naturally spread over time. Each day’s session begins and ends with brief instruction. Instructors offer topical prompts throughout the practice. Intermittent repetition can keep old ideas active in students’ minds until they’re ready to engage. Rather than delivering a bound monograph on meditation, instructors can slowly unfurl an idea over hundreds of days. Critically, these apps are a mass medium, just as books are: lessons can be “written” once and redistributed cheaply to huge audiences. Could this approach be applied more generally?</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/leftFloat3.png" role="presentation">
			<p>To engage with a book’s ideas over time, readers must remember its details, and <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books">that’s already a challenge</a>. One promising solution lies in <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">spaced repetition memory systems</a>, which allow users to retain large quantities of knowledge reliably and efficiently. Like meditation, these systems involve a daily practice: every day, a reader maintains their memory library by reviewing a few dozen lightweight prompts. Each prompt asks a detailed question, like “What types of stimuli does George Miller’s span of absolute judgment describe?” Each day’s session is different because each prompt repeats on its own schedule. When a user remembers or forgets the answer to a prompt, the system expands or contracts that prompt’s repetition interval along an exponential curve. These expanding intervals allow readers to maintain a collection of thousands of prompts while reviewing only a few dozen each day. Practitioners generally complete their review sessions in moments which would otherwise go unused, like when waiting in line.</p>
			<img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/timeline.png" alt="This figure illustrates pages of a book being presented along a timeline of expanding intervals.">
			<p>Despite their efficacy, these systems are not yet widely adopted. One important barrier to adoption is that it’s surprisingly difficult to write good prompts. To explore one potential solution, we created an experimental quantum computing textbook, <em><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a></em>. It’s written in a “<a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">mnemonic medium</a>,” interleaving expert-authored spaced repetition prompts into the reading experience. Our goal was to help readers engage with challenging technical material by supporting their memory. <img src="https://numinous.productions/timeful/images/rightFloat2.png" role="presentation">As we interviewed readers, though, we noticed that the regular review sessions didn’t just build detailed retention: the ongoing practice also changed readers’ relationship to the material by maintaining their contact with it over time. These people didn’t just read the book once and proceed with their lives. <em>Quantum Country</em>’s review sessions returned readers to its ideas again and again over weeks and months.</p>
			<p><em>Quantum Country</em>’s prompts are designed to help readers remember technical material, but it may be possible to adapt similar mechanisms to support future timeful texts.</p>
			<p>Consider <em>The Elements of Style</em>, a classic writing primer by Strunk and White. The authors demonstrate the value of parallel construction with this example from the Bible: “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” But it’s not enough to read an example. Good writers’ ears become automatically alert to these constructions. They notice opportunities to create parallelisms, and they notice dissonance when similar phrases are presented differently. It takes time to develop this awareness.</p>
			<p>What if, a week after learning about parallel construction, a reader’s review session included this prompt?</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The following quote has been modified to remove a parallel construction. How might you rewrite it to add parallel construction? How do the two differ in effect?</p>
				<p>“My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Instead, reflect on what you can contribute to these United States.” (modified from a quote by John F. Kennedy, which would be revealed in its original form once the reader had finished with the prompt)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A week or two later, a similar prompt might appear with a different distorted quote. For example: “You can fool all the people some of the time, and you can mislead many listeners consistently. But you won’t be able to fool everyone reliably.” (adapted from Abraham Lincoln)</p>
			<p>Such prompts might seem onerous or strange on their own, but what if most educated people maintained a regular review practice of the kind we’ve described? The example reflection prompt would sit between others on physics, poetry, and whatever else you’d been thinking about. If you found the prompt useful, it would recur in another week; if not, perhaps it would reappear in a few months. A book like <em>The Elements of Style</em> might include dozens or hundreds of prompts like these on various topics, so that you’d see one or two each day over weeks and months as you integrate its ideas into the way you view and practice writing.</p>
			<p>In early chapters of <em>Quantum Country</em>, readers see every prompt as they read the text, and the prompts remain the same in the ensuing review sessions. But in the final chapter, we added a new kind of prompt which changes over time in a programmed sequence. Perhaps future timeful texts could unfurl their contents over the course of many sessions, much as we observed that digital meditation lessons do.</p>
			<p>Of course, spaced repetition is just one approach for writing timeful texts. What other powerful tools might it be possible to create, making future books into artifacts that transcend their pages, as they slowly help readers shape their lives?</p>

One even sees increasing talk about the need for better online social networks — ones that foster positive human experience and development, reasonable thinking and imaginative creation.</p><p id="a079">What I haven’t yet seen, however, is much real understanding of why our current online social networks are the way they are, and what might be done to fix them.</p><p id="46c1">What we need to create a better social network, in my view, is relatively straightforward to state:</p><p id="eb94"><strong>1.</strong> Code should be open source.</p><p id="e4af"><strong>2. </strong>Ownership and control should be decentralized… so there is no company and no government tasked and burdened with calling all the shots. Embedding blockchain technologies deep in the technical design of the network is the right way to achieve this.</p><p id="f752"><strong>3.</strong> Major decisions should be made democratically. If some group systematically doesn’t like the outcomes votes are getting, they can fork the code and make a new version, or copy the code and create a new network using the same software.</p><p id="d04a"><strong>4.</strong> Recommendations of connections and content should be made using AI that has the ability to explain the reasons behind its judgments — and these explanations need to be shown routinely to users in a way they can understand.</p><p id="c2c7">Due to SingularityNET and a variety of other recent developments, we already have the basic technologies needed to support this sort of approach — as far as tech is concerned, we could have decentralized, democratic, transparent and ethical alternatives to Facebook Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and so forth right now. We even have some existing websites — such as <a href="http://minds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minds.com</a> — embodying significant parts of the above.</p><p id="ab48">What we still don’t have — yet! — is the alignment of resources to get alternatives fulfilling all four of the above points fully built-out … and then pushed toward wide adoption.</p><p id="6e32">In this essay, I’m going to dig a bit into the collective-psychology implications of current centralized social networks and future potential decentralized alternatives. Given the key role that social networks currently play in channelling, guiding and crystallizing collective human thought and emotion, these are not just issues regarding the infrastructure of a particular technology sector — they may actually be critical to the future path of humanity.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2576/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png" width="1288" height="709" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pzRyZbUayGqqpqpmUC6eFw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="7b1f">The current mode of organizing social networks presents companies like Facebook with seemingly unsolvable problems. Should Facebook take down racist posts? What about posts with indirect racist implications? Posts explicitly aimed at affecting political elections using false information? What about questionable information? What makes information “too questionable”?</p><p id="5947">In relatively free regions like e.g. the US or Western Europe, government’s role in modulating public speech is restricted to extreme cases of directly dangerous speech (directly advocating violence, explicit forms of “hate speech” etc.). I believe this is for the best, as the alternative of giving government stronger control over speech has glaringly obvious failure modes — i.e. it can be used by fascist-minded government leaders to squelch the public dialogue needed to organize opposition to their rule.</p><p id="19e4">However, less extreme, less directly dangerous instances of public speaking can also have a dramatic and systematically destructive impact on individual minds and the public mind — and in the current situation in the “free world”, these are being modulated by corporations in a very ad hoc way. And these corporations, run by digital marketing and tech geek types, are wholly unsuited to the subtle problem of modulating online information, knowledge and relationship flow for humanity. These organizations are optimized for delivering software and delivering ads and making money — not for guiding the public mind toward the broader good.</p><p id="dfa8">On the positive side, there are all sorts of brilliant ideas and wonderful creations being put out there on the Internet every minute of every day — but most of these have a hard time finding the audience they deserve because most of the currently widely operational information dissemination mechanisms are oriented toward corporate profit maximization rather than general human (or transhuman!) benefit maximization.</p><p id="8343">So given that it’s best to keep governments out of the modulation of non-extreme, not-directly-dangerous public speech — and given also that corporations running social media networks are not well suited for the job — then what can we do?</p><p id="fb1f">What we can do, of course, is roll out information and relationship coordination systems that allow the community of individuals engaged in social networks to carry out intelligent information and relationship management themselves — via their explicit judgments and decisions, and their implicit actions.</p><p id="2b59">SingularityNET’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation system</a> is one tool designed to help with this — it provides a framework for leveraging data regarding user behaviours to estimate the reputation or value that a given user assigned to another person or an information source or piece of information. Using tools like this, each person guides what information they see, based on AI algorithms calibrated for their own benefit rather than the benefit of corporations seeking to profit from them.</p><p id="82b6">You can learn more this here <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03857.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighted liquid rank reputation systems for marketplaces</a>, also on the following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.singularitynet.io/computing-reputation-for-discourse-users-with-aigents-25b806277e74]">Discourse forums</a>.</p><p id="c6ed">But how can people know these AI algorithms are acting for their own benefit? Transparent and explainable AI is another key ingredient here. SingularityNET reputation system can leverage either opaque or transparent AI for making predictions of how much a given user will appreciate a given other person, source or datum. Embedding neural-symbolic AI into the reputation system is one strategy that can enable a reasonable degree of explainability, as symbolic patterns can generally be simplified and rearranged into explainable form via automated transformations.</p><p id="5a97">Creating analogues of modern social networks architected according to the above principles would not be incredibly hard given available technologies. There would be a lot of engineering required, but mankind is now capable of doing a lot of engineering.</p><p id="51c0">The essential reason fair and democratic and non-stupid large-scale social networks built along these lines do not exist, is that nobody with adequate financial resources has wanted to put in the money to build one.</p><p id="81c9">One may ask why such a thing hasn’t just been created by volunteer OSS developers or entrepreneurial devs. One core issue is that such a social network framework would only be valuable once it had a lot of users. Because of this, the reality or perception is that getting such a project off the ground at this stage — with huge entrenched centralized competitors — would require a massive marketing budget.</p><p id="fa00">I would love to see SingularityNET and OpenCog used as foundational tools for the implementation and operation of this sort of social network, and would welcome partnerships with other groups interested to collaborate on this sort of work.</p><p id="40ff">But what I want to explore a little more here in this article are some of the subtler reasons why <strong><em>transparency, explainability and decentralization are so important in social network construction</em></strong>.</p><p id="c6a9">I’m going to get a little theoretical here — but before long I’ll get back to the practical.</p><p id="9d73">How and why did our social networks become this way?</p><p id="d63e">Of course, the profit motive underlying the companies that build and operate these social networks — Facebook, Twitter and the rest — is part of the problem. The goal of the social network becomes maximum addictiveness because this is the most straightforward way to maximize profit in this particular business niche … and human psychology being what it is, the way to achieve maximum addictiveness is to appeal to a mix of emotions in a rather perverse way.</p><p id="df6a">Much as junk food perverts our taste and smell system to create unhealthy addictive food experiences of a sort that didn’t exist in the Paleolithic environment we evolved for, similarly, current social networks pervert our social, cognitive and emotional systems to create unhealthy addictive informational and relational experiences of a sort that didn’t exist before Internet tech came along.</p><p id="2f30">But the drive to profit from maximum addictiveness is only one of the more proximal aspects of the problem. The destructive perversity we see in modern social networks is a self-organizing phenomenon, which is fed by the drive on the part of social network designers to create addictive experiences but has additional special properties.</p><p id="17af">The nature of addiction is that: <strong><em>Not only is the addictive thing enjoyable, but its absence is painful … and the amount needed to get enjoyment keeps going up.</em></strong> So if you’re addicted to something, the more you use it, the more urgently you need to use it more… etc. in a feedback loop.</p><p id="220e">One may rephrase this as:<strong><em> The more an addictive thing is done, the less psychological energy it takes to do it again … and the more psychological energy it takes to not do it again.</em></strong></p><p id="a5c6">In a way addiction is a lot like long-term potentiation (LTP), a basic principle of learning in the brain — the more a synaptic connection between two neurons is used, the easier it gets for the charge to spread along that connection. I.e., the more that charge flows along with a connection, the less energy has to be spent to get a given amount of charge to the other end of that connection.</p><p id="d2d7">LTP in the brain — also known as “<a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Hebbian_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebbian learning</a>” after 1940s neural learning theorist Donald Hebb — leads to the formation of complex cell assemblies representing knowledge, ideas, behaviours and so forth. Similarly, addictive dynamics in social networks — addiction to messaging in particular groups, or to particular people, in particular …</p></div></div></section></div>

<figcaption>Ma Yuan, Scholar Viewing a Waterfall</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Georges Dumézil in his 1929 book Flamen-Brahman proposed that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social groups: The productive class, which practiced agriculture, pastoralism, and artisanship; the martial class, which waged war and defended the tribe; and the sovereign class, wielding authority both juridicial and spiritual, whose place it was to rule. As societies grew more complex and division of labor became more granular, further specializations came to be recognized, but they remained grounded in the original tripartite: worker, warrior, and priest.</p>

<p>The earliest incarnation of the priestly class made sense of the chaos of the natural world, locating agency in what appeared to be random processes. They performed rituals in an effort to beseech or control the spirits or gods that governed the land. They read the auspices by which the gods made their will known to mortals. They served as the memory of a people and enacted judgment against transgressors.</p>

<p>The priestly role is, in a word, systematization. Their chief purpose is to construct the reality in which their adherents live. They provide order and grounding, defining the base truths those of a society take axiomatically. It is on these axioms that all else is built.</p>

<p>It is customary to divide the history of communication into four periods: oral, manuscript, print, and electronic. Systems native to each period were in large part defined by the the means they provided to catalog and disseminate information. Writing enabled the development of institutions of knowledge unbound by the limits of memory and generational transmission, marking a shift from teaching and knowing to study and interpretation. Print allowed for texts to be distributed to the masses directly rather than dictated by an intermediary and enlisted their participation in the act of interpreting. The internet now is the means by which anyone may author and transmit their own texts unencumbered by previous physical constraints.</p>

<p>The Church in the manuscript era constructed a shared reality, a substratum of truth binding its members together and which they sought to recruit all peoples into, which we may call Christendom. The Reformation, waxing alongside print, irrevocably destroyed this framework; however, the Protestant faiths by nature could never provide the same unity of purpose. Instead, the writers who reformulated concepts such as rights and sovereignty such that they could stand alone, as axioms, laid the groundwork for the new reality to follow. In this way secularism, republicanism, and such can be seen neither as a salve for the century of bloodshed the Reformation inaugurated, nor as the culmination of the ideas Luther put forward. Rather, they formed a distinct set of beliefs competing for and eventually winning preeminence in lands Catholic and Protestant alike over a longer, multi-century period of religious war. This worldview likewise energizes its adherents to spread it across the globe, and it remains the most powerful and widespread meaning-making system to this day, commanding the mass of peoples that we may call the Public.</p>

<p>With the internet, we are in the early stages of its destruction. The trend from the rotary press to the television was cohesion, toward a unitary Public. The trend for the past two and a half decades has been one of fragmentation, a diffusion of various publics. Just as the Church formed the basis of people's understanding of themselves and the society they lived in in the era of the manuscript, and the press did the same in the era of print, a new mode is emerging shaped by present technology.</p>

<p>The major platforms at present incentivize the profusion of cloistered micro-communities, exchanging ideas among themselves and with their immediate neighbors that come to form their own realities inscrutable to outsiders. This is not a necessary consequence of the underlying technology, but rather the result of design decisions made by the programmers who author these systems. Discourse over how platforms "ought" to function tends to focus on a tension between the desire of tech companies to operate as simple businesses disinterested in higher questions against a perceived necessity for them to fill the role once occupied by the press as defenders of liberal democracy. This framing, however, misses the wealth of options available beyond letting events run their course or stemming the unwinding of the present order. A programmer class conscious of its potential to fill the now-vacant priestly role could leverage this position for arbitrary ends, design its systems to shape the reality of its choosing. Whether one finds this intriguing or frightening is a matter of taste.</p>

<p>❧</p>

<p>Before there was writing, there was speech. Orality is best regarded as a technology in its own right, with its own techniques and affordances. In contrast to a common view of oral culture as necessarily egalitarian and collaborative, the priestly role, concerned with narration and preservation of societal memory, was a specialized one. The guru-shishya system of preserving the Vedas was the most highly developed form and serves as a testament to the possibility for thoroughness without relying on the written word. Students learned various recitations, or pathas, of the corpus—continuous, word-by-word, with or without euphonic combinations—and their consonance served as a built-in form of error-checking. Phonology was standardized as the Vedic pitch accent, sidestepping the problem many traditions have with linguistic drift. Putting the Vedas to paper was later done almost as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Most cultures were not nearly as thorough or organized, however, and over time many traditions drifted or diverged from their original forms. Especially in times of upheaval, there are no caches of texts to rediscover after the crisis abates. Tellers must simply make do with what they are given, and indeed the kernel of a shared tradition can often be found in wildly divergent bodies of knowledge from cultures cleaved from each other by distance, war, or time.</p>

<p>The advent of written language allowed oral cultures to be centralized and canonized, relieving the burdens and lossiness of memory. Traditions were made into texts, singular and authoritative. Externalizing memory to papyrus or parchment enormously expanded the scope of what could be retained. It also eliminated the necessity for exactitude and endless repetition when instructing students, allowing for a stronger focus on meaning and interpretation.</p>

<p>Socrates called writing "the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom" in a dialogue with Phaedrus, remarking that it enabled surface-level understandings and made up for deficiencies of recall. He goes on however to make a rather subtler point:</p>

<blockquote> Writing, Phaedrus, has this strange quality, and is very like painting; for the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they spoke as if they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing. And every word, when once it is written, is bandied about, alike among those who understand and those who have no interest in it, and it knows not to whom to speak or not to speak; when ill-treated or unjustly reviled it always needs its father to help it; for it has no power to protect or help itself.</blockquote>

<p>Writing, he argues, cannot elaborate on its meaning any further than what is written, a quality unlike that of a speaker. But where Socrates sees this as an objective deficiency, it instead comes to serve as a defining characteristic of the written word. With no necessity for chain of transmission from author to student, independent interpretation and commentary become central to text. Where the priesthoods of orality focused on memory, the priesthoods of the manuscript monopolized meaning.</p>

<p>As the Vedic guru-shishya traditions exemplify a structure defined by orality, Catholic Christianity serves as one shaped by the manuscript. Catholicism had since its institutionalization with the conversion of Constantine, been intensely hierarchical and strictly focused on the precision of doctrine. Many of its major controversies centered on theological disagreements by the clergy on unsettled questions of interpretation. In contrast to explicitly outsider folk movements such as the earlier gnostics or later medieval heresies, those pushing positions later declared anathema under labels such as Arianism, Nestorianism, or Monophysitism were insiders made into outsiders by conciliar fiat. The Great Schism, despite originating as a political dispute, became a dogmatic one as the two churches diverged, with East moving toward an experiential focus with theoria and hesychasm, while West embraced pagan philosophy and the austere studiousness defined of an emerging scholasticism.</p>

<p>Catholicism, in other words, evolved into a system organized around command structure and authoritative interpretation of texts exclusively done by the priestly class. As dogma proceeded down the hierarchy and completely excluded the input of the laity, much of the role of the clergy was to dictate to congregants passages of text and their proper meanings. The primary duty of lay members in Catholicism was to receive, in faith, the sacraments. Their access to and understanding of scripture was mediated by the figure of the priest, who offered narration during Mass and guidance during Penance. Lay Bible-reading was not only unnecessary for salvation but actively discouraged all the way until Vatican II, and to this day the practice is comparatively rare next to the Protestant traditions.</p>

<p>Being the educated class par excellence, the priesthood and the rulership were long intertwined. Pepin the Short, in concert with Pope Zachary, …</p></div></div>

But, until now, there has been little independent research published on their performance (both relative to each other and against state of the art open source models). We ran a standard dataset through all three tools to see how they stack up against each other.</p><p>If you are considering using computer vision services from Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure in your product (or you have trained an object detection model of your own and are wondering where you stand in comparison to AutoML) this is the post for you.</p><p>In this post, we review <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/">Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Azure Custom Vision</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl">Google Cloud AutoML Vision</a>. We'll weigh the pros/cons between them and we'll also compare them against results from <a href="https://models.roboflow.ai/object-detection/yolov5">YOLOv5x</a>, a current-generation open source model.</p><p>We evaluate each product on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Training Time (how long to train the model)</li><li>Training Cost (how much to train the model)</li><li>Model Performance (how accurate is the model)</li><li>Inference Time (how long to predict on a test image)</li><li>Inference Costs (how much to predict once on a test image)</li></ul><p>We also provide insight into the major limitations of each platform and ease of use.</p><h3 id="summary-">Summary:</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg" alt="google cloud automl vs aws rekognition vs azure custom-vision" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/autoML_table.002.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Our overall conclusion:</strong> AutoML tools are a great way to assess the feasibility of a computer vision project, even if you plan to eventually train a custom model architecture. Evaluating tradeoffs among the big three cloud providers depends on your project specifications (how important is inference speed; what accuracy threshold is required; what inference volume do you expect; what is the size of your dataset). Open source model architectures, while expensive to build and maintain, perform on par with big cloud provider options.</p><p>Unfortunately, each platform uses its own proprietary API and data format so it is very cumbersome to get started and compare solutions. Moreover, once you're up and running, you're locked in. (Luckily, <a href="https://roboflow.ai/">Roboflow</a> solves this by seamlessly integrating with all three.)</p><h2 id="overview-of-the-automl-process">Overview of the AutoML Process</h2><p>No matter which platform you choose, you will be entering a similar workflow to create and deploy your computer vision model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-54.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-54.png 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The AutoML Process in a diagram</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong> - In order to train a computer vision model, you first need to acquire images that appear in your domain of interest. The narrower you keep your domain the better your model will perform. Then, your images will need to be labeled providing supervision to train your model to learn the vision concepts in question.</p><p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation</strong> - you will kick of training, a process where the computer formulates an algorithm based on training images to apply to images that it has never seen. Your model will then be evaluated based on how well it performs during predictions. This may be an iterative process as you add data and adjust training length. </p><p><strong>Model Deployment and Inference - </strong>Once you have a suitable model, you will deploy this model to a compute instance and stand up an API endpoint that you can hit to receive predictions based on what your model is seeing in your production images. </p><p>The cloud providers separate data labeling from AutoML, and we will be focusing on reviewing the AutoML service in this post, <strong>assuming you have already collected a labeled dataset.</strong></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-ms-coco">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - MS COCO</h2><p>The original plan was to benchmark these services on the modern standard, the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">Microsoft Common Objects in Context Object Detection</a> (COCO) dataset.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>all three tools failed this challenge</strong> and we were unable to complete training on COCO.</p><p><strong>Rekognition Custom Labels</strong><em> -</em> has a hard-cap on the maximum training time of 72 node-hours per job. If your dataset takes longer than that to converge, the job will time out. Rekognition did not complete the MS COCO job before its time limit was exceeded and, thus, failed our test. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/limits.html">Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML</strong> - there was a limit of 100MB for annotation upload. We were able to work around this by splitting the file into several chunks but the estimated budget for training MS COCO on Google Cloud AutoML was $6000. Sorry, but there's no way we're spending that on a blog post... <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/quotas">Quotas and Limits Page</a></p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision</strong> - maxes out at 100,000 training images (COCO has over 200,000). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/limits-and-quotas">Limits and Quotas Page</a></p><h2 id="the-big-cloud-automl-challenge-pascal-voc">The Big Cloud AutoML Challenge - Pascal VOC</h2><p>In order to compare the accuracy of AutoML vision solutions, we fell back to an older benchmark object detection task, the<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/"> Pascal VOC 2012 Object Detection dataset</a>.</p><p><strong>The object detection task - </strong>Object detection challenges the computer to learn to draw bounding boxes around objects belonging to collection of object classes of interest.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-55.png" alt=""><figcaption>Azure Custom Vision displays an image in Pascal VOC</figcaption></figure><p>The Pascal VOC 2012 dataset has 13,690 training images and 3,428 validation images across 20 object classes.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-56.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-56.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-56.png 1324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The class distribution for the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (via <a href="https://docs.roboflow.ai/dataset-health-check">Roboflow Dataset Health Check</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Pascal VOC withholds the dataset's test set so we evaluate the cloud platforms with their performance on the validation set.</p><h2 id="training-costs">Training Costs</h2><p>Once you have loaded your dataset into Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud AutoML Vision, or Azure Custom Vision, you are ready to train your model.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-57.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-57.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-57.png 1449w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Kicking off training on Pascal VOC in Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels</figcaption></figure><p>Training a model is a computationally intensive task, as the computer iterates through your dataset it will be optimizing millions of neural network parameters. To do this efficiently, the AutoML services will boot up GPU nodes.</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Cost - </strong>Training is started and runs until the model has reached maximum performance. You are unable to control how long training occurs for. Training costs $1/hr/instance and Amazon may provision multiple compute instances to train your model. So your training job may complete in two hours but you will be billed for more if more instances were started. Training can run for a maximum of 72 node hours. If it times out, your training cost is refunded. Be careful, you cannot stop training jobs that have started! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/pricing/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Cost - </strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision trains their model with 8 nodes with Tesla V100 GPUs. Each node hour is $3.15/hr, so ~$25 per wall clock hour. AutoML Vision allows you the ability to start, stop, and resume model training, which can be nice to anticipate the costs before the training job has started. There is no limit to the amount of training time you can provision in Google Cloud AutoML Vision. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/pricing">Pricing Page</a>.</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Cost - </strong>Azure Custom Vision is less verbose in explaining their training costs - it costs $20/compute hour, but the underlying hardware is undisclosed so it is unclear how this stacks up against the Google and Amazon price/performance. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/">Pricing Page</a>.</p><h2 id="training-time">Training Time</h2><p>It is hard to benchmark training costs without factoring in training time. Each service may be running a larger or smaller model architecture, and may have varying levels of training time software optimization.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/ezgif.com-video-to-gif--10-.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Waiting for training to complete in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>When starting your training job, you have the ability to choose between large or compact models based on your downstream inference time needs in Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon Rekognition just provides one size fits all. </p><p>Smaller models train faster, infer faster, but perform less well.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-59.png" alt=""><figcaption>Choosing model size in Google Cloud AutoML Vision</figcaption></figure><p>In this face off, we optimized all models for accuracy (and tried to train with a similar budget).</p><p><strong>Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Training Time- </strong>Rekognition completed the training job on the Pascal VOC 2012 training set in 26 node hours, costing $26. To make a fair comparison, we sought to use this as our training budget across platforms.</p><p><strong>Google Cloud AutoML Vision Training Time - </strong>To stick with with the Rekognition training cost baseline, we would need to use 9 node hours in Google Cloud AutoML Vision, but the minimum time allowed was 20 hours for our PascalVOC 2012 dataset, costing $60. The <strong>recommended</strong> training time was 1,080 node hours - which would have cost a whopping $3402. We chose to train for the minimum time allowed (which still cost &gt;2x Rekognition).</p><p><strong>Azure Custom Vision Training Time - </strong>Sticking with the Rekognition baseline, we provisioned 1 hour of training time for Azure Custom Vision, costing $20.</p><p>It is worth noting that Google Cloud AutoML Vision and Azure Custom Vision could have likely earned better evaluation performance with a larger training budget. Rekognition does not let you configure this tradeoff at all.</p><h2 id="reported-evaluation-metrics">Reported Evaluation Metrics</h2><p>Object detection systems are rated by <a href="https://blog.roboflow.ai/what-is-mean-average-precision-object-detection/">the mean average precision metric</a>, a measure of how well the model is detecting objects in test images that it has never seen.</p><p>Google Cloud AutoML Vision is the only platform that reports unbiased evaluation metrics. <strong>Azure Custom Vision and Rekognition are slanting their results in their favor.

July 28, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/5-steps-that-decreased-our-bounce-rate-by-a-huge-41-percent">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/bounce2.png"></center>
<p>When my mother in law told me the solitaire game she loved was no longer online, my friend and I thought that it might be a fun project to launch our own site. We had previously built a consumer business that reached 30M students yearly, and thought solitaire could be a fun playground to learn about gaming and even tie in and test concepts like mental stress and cognition. </p>
<p>We launched our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">free solitaire game</a> on Solitaired.com. </p>
<p>As users came in, we saw that our bounce rate averaged around 37%. â€œNot bad,â€� we thought. Most content sites had much higher bounce rates, and our past businesses that were optimized had bounce rates in that range. When we studied other gaming sites though using Similar Web, we saw that they had lower bounce rates. What if we can achieve something similar or better?</p>
<h2 id="1investigatingbrowserissuesmovingfrom37to34">1. Investigating browser issues: moving from 37% to 34%</h2>
<p>From past experience, we know getting our site to work across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari is no easy feat. Each browser has its nuances, and even if our solitaire game works smoothly on one browser, it doesnâ€™t mean it will work smoothly on others. </p>
<p>Having quickly launched our solitaire site, MVP style, we hypothesized this may be a good place to look based on past experience. </p>
<p>Low and behold, we saw that Safari had a terrible 56% bounce rate. </p>
<p>When we loaded the game in the browser, we noticed that upon clicking the cards, they sometimes did not move as expected. It was a major bug!</p>
<p>We also saw that IE Explorer had an even worse bounce rate of 73%. </p>
<p>With IE Explorer being less than 1% of our traffic and being phased out for Edge, we decided not to invest our time there, and instead fix the Safari bug. </p>
<p>The result: bounce rate decreased by 8%, and dropped to an average of 34%!</p>
<h2 id="2optimizingmobileresponsivenessmovingfrom34to30">2. Optimizing mobile responsiveness: moving from 34% to 30%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/mobile.png"></p>
<p>We saw in our data that mobile users represented approximately 20% of our user base, so we knew that was a segment we needed to pay attention to. </p>
<p>When we looked at our mobile bounce rate in Google Analytics, it was well above our new average of 34%, hovering at 51%. That was clearly an issue. </p>
<p>We first saw in our vertical orientation on mobile that the cards were almost illegible. When we increased the size, mobile bounce rate improved meaningfully to 40%. </p>
<p>Still though, the cards were small because they were limited by the length of the phone in vertical orientation. </p>
<p>What if we optimized our horizontal orientation?</p>
<p>First, we made sure that when tilted horizontally, the cards would take up the entire screen, making the card interaction easier. Then, we created a graphic to encourage uses in vertical orientation to try horizontal orientation for a better experience. </p>
<p>The result: overall bounce rate dropped to 30%!</p>
<h2 id="3changingthecardbackmovingfrom30to28">3. Changing the card back: moving from 30% to 28%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/design2.png"></p>
<p>In our support center, a user asked if we could offer a better design for our card back. We reached out to this user, and asked why.</p>
<p>She said that our current design looked pixelated and didnâ€™t contract well with the green felt. Instead, a red card back that looked like a real card could be better, and indicate that our site was a high quality one. It was one of those insights where you kick yourself and say â€œduh.â€� </p>
<p>To be sure, we ran a user survey via hotjar showing a new card design. 71% of respondents said they preferred our current red card back on the site.</p>
<p>After making this change and our bounce rate decreased to an average of 28%</p>
<h2 id="4addingimportantfunctionalityandreducingbouncerateto26">4. Adding important functionality and reducing bounce rate to 26%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Features.png"></p>
<p>In classic solitaire, there are two popular forms of games played. One is where you turn 1 card at a time over from the stockpile, and another where you turn 3 cards over from the stockpile. </p>
<p>We default to turn 1, but only in our all games menu did we link to the turn 3 options. </p>
<p>We hypothesized that many of our users wanted a turn 3 option, and may have been bouncing when they didnâ€™t see that immediately available. We ran a quick user survey via HotJar and which confirmed this, giving us confidence itâ€™s worth adding this to the game. We added a tab that allows you to flip between modes.</p>
<p>Not only did we see turn 3 solitaire play increase materially, but we further reduced our bounce rate to 26%. 
Whatâ€™s interesting is our users did not naturally write in saying they couldnâ€™t find turn 3. Those users who were looking for it likely just naturally bounced. We had to research and hypothesize to unearth this.</p>
<h2 id="5leveragingdatatodropthebouncerateto22">5. Leveraging data to drop the bounce rate to 22%</h2>
<p><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/getstarted.png"></p>
<p>Once we added Google event tracking to all our buttons, we were able to get insights into what features were most engaged, and it was eye opening. </p>
<p>It turned out that the hint button was a popular feature. In retrospect, it made sense. Itâ€™s easy to get stuck in solitaire, and undoing is the only way to get you back on track. </p>
<p>We found that after the new game and undo feature, this was the next most popular one, with 20% of our audience clicking it. </p>
<p>However, the hint was on the far right of our navigation. Knowing that internet users look at websites in an F-shaped pattern, this meant that some users who might be new to solitaire might not even notice this feature. If they donâ€™t know how to play, the hint feature is critical to getting them started.</p>
<p>We moved the hint button right after the undo button, closer to the left of the screen. We not only did this increase clicks on it by 25%, we reduced our bounce rate to 22%. Users who had to brush up on how to play solitaire suddenly had an easy way to do that.</p>
<h2 id="youcanalwaysimproveuserexperience">You can always improve user experience.</h2>
<p>Focusing on bounce rate is a great place to start when improving your site. Improving your bounce rate is the rising tide that lifts all business KPIs.</p>
<p>Start collecting data and try user tracking tools like HotJar to understand where there are opportunities to improve. Youâ€™ll be surprised by how much you can improve.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3e42f2d53b29461b2add"><div><p>Magnetism is a common phenomenon for all, yet poorly understood by most. We become acquainted with magnetism from a very early age, maybe noticing that they’re used to pin photos and documents to the refrigerator by our parents or maybe we experience them as toys. Maybe we were lucky enough to experience magnetic sand at a science museum. If we were born in Japan, Germany, or Russia, we may have had first-hand experience with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#New_York,_United_States,_1968"><span>magnetically levitated trains</span></a>. In any event, we were each almost certainly astounded by our first encounter with magnets; a seemingly magical action-at-a-distance between two otherwise ordinary looking objects. If you can’t remember the feeling, watch&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/qI8AM8UM7kI?t=29"><span>this kid</span></a>.</p><div><p>But action-at-a-distance is not a matter of magic, it is a matter of physics. Our sense of wonder for magnets may turn to an inquiry into the science behind the familiar phenomenon. Perhaps that is what led you to this page. Unfortunately, as of this publication, the overwhelming majority of explanations for magnetic action terminate in one of two dead-ends. First, you will learn that atoms&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM"><span>are each tiny magnets</span></a>&nbsp;and so composite materials simply behave depending on the coordination of their subunits. This obviously punts the question of what makes the tiny magnets attract? For that line of inquiry, we are generally met with the second fatal roadblock:&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms interact magnetically due to magnetic fields. Of course, this explanation, however deep one dives into the mathematical descriptions of fields, begs the question: what&nbsp;<em>is</em>a magnetic field?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"><span>The magnetic field</span></a>&nbsp;of physics is a dynamic description — that is, it has both a shape and motion. This is evident from the basic unit of magnetic field strength, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere"><span>ampere</span></a>/m. The ampere signifies charge per time and is the basic unit of current. Hence, a magnetic field is dynamic: it what some<em>thing</em>&nbsp;is doing. Therefore, in alternative to traditional visualizations, our explanation of magnetism begins not with an activity like a field but with an actor: the atom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Magnetism is presently understood as one side of a double-headed atomic phenomenon called electromagnetism. Electricity being the simpler of the two faces, it is all but imperative that you go back and&nbsp;<a href="https://demystifyingscience.com/blog/how-to-visualize-electricity"><span>read our work-up</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OakgcRuBBbg"><span>watch the animation</span></a>&nbsp;for visualizing electricity before proceeding here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are short on time, I’ll provide you with an extremely brief re-cap. We integrate contemporary mathematical descriptions of electricity into an explanation that we believe improves upon traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XWeQuEhU4"><span>hydraulic</span></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rb9guSEeVE"><span>and electron-bead-flow</span></a>&nbsp;models.&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, we illustrate the concept of charge through the rotation of atomic surfaces. These surfaces, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.orbitals.com/orb/index.html"><span>electron shells (e-shell) or orbitals</span></a>, behave per quantum mechanical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function"><span>electron wave functions</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surface-to-surface transmission of e-shell rotation between aligned shells of atoms constitutes electricity. Although there are never electron beads moving along in our wire, our visualization of electricity is entirely consistent with modern mathematical representations. Current flow is merely reimagined as propagation of&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;e-shell surface rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We utilize the simplest and most abundant atom, hydrogen, for our explanation of both electricity and magnetism, since it has only a single electron forming one e-shell orbital. We fashion a simple, hypothetical single-atom-thick wire from ionized hydrogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ionization indicates that the atoms electron surface is not localized by enmeshed with its neighbors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can extend the electromagnetic principles applied to hydrogen across other more complex elements and molecules by the careful addition of orbital surfaces, recognizing that new e-shells may participate in conduction and bonding alone while others may rotate freely and separately contribute to magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic action is next explained as a natural extension of the aligned rotation of conducting electron surfaces in a current-carrying wire. Through the vertical transmission of rotational momentum between atoms through polar surface contact, a horizontal interaction is also introduced toward their equators. The magnetic field, B, of the atom describes this surface motion, which occurs 90 degrees orthogonal to current, I (see&nbsp;<strong>Fig 1A</strong>).</p><p>The reason that magnetic action extends beyond the current-carrying wire’s apparent surface is that while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Chemistry/armstrong/chem_101a/h_orbitals.pdf"><span>99.999% of the electron exists within 430 pm of the nucleus</span></a>, there is a small chance of finding that surface extended to incredible distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, under Quantum Mechanics,&nbsp;<a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Book%3A_An_Introduction_to_the_Electronic_Structure_of_Atoms_and_Molecules_(Bader)/3%3A_The_Hydrogen_Atom/3.3%3A_The_Probability_Distribution_of_the_Hydrogen_Atom"><span>the radial distribution function</span></a>&nbsp;for the electron has no limit on reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;For our model, we represent this unusual quality of the atom as rarefied extensions of the electron shell:&nbsp;&nbsp;incredibly thin filaments, radially organized about the atom (<strong>Fig 1B)</strong>.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595356514575_50369"><p>We imagine the physical extensions of the atomic surface are responsible for the action-at-a-distance. Lateral magnetic motion of conductive rotating e-shells thus synergizes between current-aligned wires, pulling them together as shown in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong>&nbsp;below (panels&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>). This illustrates the basic principle of magnetic attraction. By inverting one of the wires, we find that currents are now opposed, as are the magnetic actions of each column’s atoms (<strong>Fig 2C</strong>). The clash of opposing effort between e-shells in each column drives the wires apart and illustrates magnetic repulsion.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_18181"><div><p>To construct the most basic magnet imaginable, we coil up our single-file hydrogen wire as shown in below in&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3</strong>. Coiling of the wire aligns the lateral motion of all e-shells on the surface of the composite cylinder (<strong>Fig 3B</strong>). The combined flow of the coil’s composite surface appears to track out from one end of the coil and into the other. The composite magnetic field describes this pole-to-pole flow of the coil’s atomic surfaces.</p><p>It is now easy to understand how the magnetic attraction between current-aligned wires multiplies through the coil’s architecture, since lateral efforts align and combine.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we bring the North pole of one coil near the South pole of another, the radial extensions of the e-shell enmesh laterally and pull the coils together magnetically (<strong>Fig 3C</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverting one coil and pitting South vs. South or North vs. North poles has the opposite effect, where the conflicting effort of each coil’s atoms push them apart (<strong>Fig 3D</strong>).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595376469685_54398"><div><p>Again, any visualization of intricate physical processes inherently necessitates simplification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we have utilized a single-atom-thick wire of ionized hydrogen for our demonstration and readily acknowledge this as a hypothetical object only. If such a wire exists naturally, its likeness is probably only found in the deep reaches of outer space. In our every-day reality, we only encounter synthetic electromagnets comprised of more complex atoms. This means those metals have additional surfaces. In common conducting materials, such as copper, there may be several polar contacts available for electromagnetic interaction.</p><p>Even more complex metals, like those found in a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet"><span>bar magnet</span></a>, appear to utilize separate orbitals for bonding and conduction than those involved in magnetism. We would visualize distinct magnetized e-shells as freely rotating, and spatially isolated from the conductive bonding lattice. This is why “permanently” magnetized materials do not exhibit a current. Furthermore, the relevant magnetic e-shell surfaces in bar magnets still retain the essential pattern of the spiraled coil from our depiction. We are working toward an animation of these complex atoms and will present an appropriate visualization in a future post/video.</p><p>One final note is that often the strongest magnet is a combination of a magnetizable metal with a coil. A magnetizable metal has unencumbered e-shells distinct from bonding and these surfaces are readily incited to magnetic cohesion through contact with coil’s extended atomic surfaces. Often, cores of electromagnets utilize iron or nickel for the very reason that these elements are highly&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility"><span>susceptible</span></a>&nbsp;to the magnetic behaviors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"><span>moment</span></a>) of proximally excited atoms in the coil.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contributing aligned e-shells to lateral rotatory action, the iron/nickel atoms amplify the strength of the coil’s electromagnetism.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Several teams that&nbsp;ranked behind the Iroquois Nationals have been invited to compete in Alabama.</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee —&nbsp;a confederacy of six First Nations: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations — invented lacrosse and call it the&nbsp;Creator's Game.</p>  <p>The Iroquois Nationals are member in good standing of World Lacrosse. But it's the International World Games Association (IWGA) that determines eligibility for the Alabama tournament.</p>  <p>The IWGA has not responded to requests for comment. The organizing committee for the World Games in Birmingham&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/petition-calls-for-boycott-of-world-lacrosse-games-after-iroquois-nationals-excluded/">told APTN</a>&nbsp;that IWGA follows the&nbsp;criteria established by the International Olympics Committee, which states that "the expression country means an independent State recognized by the international community."</p>  <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy more than meets that definition, says Iroquois Nationals executive director Leo Nolan, a Mohawk from the Onondaga Nation. Here is part of his conversation with&nbsp;<em>As It Happens </em>guest host Susan Bonner.</p>  <p><strong>Take us through the moment you found out the Nationals were not invited to the World Games. What was your reaction?</strong></p>  <p>We found out through a third party in late September, early October.</p>  <p>We immediately sent a letter to World Lacrosse asking about our lack of inclusion. And the response back was that we didn't meet what they believed were — and this is their belief — that we wouldn't meet that criteria as a nation state to be included in the Olympics.</p>  <p>All of this is a precursor of the Olympics, which, you know, we're right now on provisional status, lacrosse as a sport. And once the provisional status is lifted, then hopefully lacrosse will be reintroduced to the Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.2707570.1595882465!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/haudenosaunee-passport.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>The Iroquois Nationals travel with Haudenosaunee passports — a fact that has led to travel delays in previous competitions. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Candace Maracle)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does the team rank worldwide?</strong></p>  <p>In the men's ... we are third in the world. And we've won the bronze medal the last two competitions, in 2014 in Denver and then in 2018 in Israel.</p>  <p>In the indoor game, we've won a silver every year it's been competed since 2003.</p>  <p><strong>So what do you think this is about then, Mr. Nolan?</strong></p>  <p>I'm not one to point fingers or to speak ill of anyone. I mean, I don't think that's the way we should operate in this time and age.</p>  <p>I think part of it could be a lack of appreciation, understanding and just basic knowledge about who&nbsp;we are as a nation state, so to speak.&nbsp;</p>  <p>There's always speculation about, you know, racism, and I think that it's wrong for us to even push that kind of thing. I don't have strong evidence of that aspect of it, and I don't think that that's the way we want to go forward with this. So I think it's more a lack of ...&nbsp;understanding our status.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>We are the originators of the game.

<p>As a nonprofit coding organization running physical events, a lot of what CodeDay does (in a normal year) requires sending things in the real-world. Broadly speaking, this includes event supplies to event teams, and swag/awards to community members and volunteers.</p>



<p>In our early days, I was shipping merch from my office, and every quarter I’d get together with a couple volunteers to assemble and ship out all the event supply boxes for the upcoming events. Eventually, this started to take up too much time.</p>



<p>This isn’t unique to organizations in STEM education, I had the same problem when I ran a startup. People love to represent the startups they use, so sending swag is a great way to market! I have fond memories from my last startup of walking around SoMa in the mornings, trying to find mail dropoffs that weren’t too full so I could stuff a some shirts in for our customers.</p>



<p>Today I’ll share our journey to a fully-automated swag distribution infrastructure. I believe this is something any startup could quickly replicate, so I hope this can save you time!</p>



<h2>First Attempt: Less Steps to Get Things Out the Door</h2>



<p>The first thing we tried was cutting out steps to get things out the door. There were two types of work I was doing: packaging, and labeling.</p>



<h3>Packaging</h3>



<p>90% of people who need swag are getting a single SKU: a t-shirt, a set of stickers, a thank-you letter, etc. So I + some volunteers started by just folding all the shirts and then packaging everything into individual envelopes.</p>



<p>Most of the time was spent on folding the shirts. We’ve recently switched to a printer that will just do this for us, <a href="https://www.gorillaprintshop.com/home">Gorilla Screen Printing in Seattle.</a> Super nice folks, and they will happily deliver individually bagged shirts with size stickers on request.</p>



<p>We kept a database of the final shipping weights of each type of packaged product.</p>



<h3>Labeling</h3>



<p>At this time, all our backend infrastructure was in PHP, so we started out by writing a PHP library to build shipping labels for UPS and USPS. Nowadays <a href="https://www.easypost.com/">Easypost </a>can do this for you, but as you’ll see soon, I don’t think this is the best route anymore.</p>



<p>The system worked like this: someone shared they were going to CodeDay on social media and then filled out a form with their address, the system generated a shipping label, and it was automatically printed with the Dymo LabelWriter API. Every morning I’d grab the printed labels, stick them on the corresponding items, and then take it to the mailbox.</p>



<p>(On the supplies side, our event management monolith, Clear, would automatically generate labels for event supplies once a quarter.)</p>



<p>A few months after we started using this library, I came across <a href="https://www.shipstation.com/">ShipStation, </a>which provides an easy API for entering shipments, and can batch-print shipment labels from a web UI. It was technically less automated than before, but it was nice to have a way to verify what was being shipped and manually add shipments, so we switched everything over.</p>



<p>This worked fine for a year or so, but eventually the volume increased a lot, and they closed the post office next to our office, so we started looking for a better solution.</p>



<h2>Second Attempt: Fully Automated Fulfillment</h2>



<p>To fully automate things, we started looking at 3rd-party logistics providers. These are companies that operate warehouses and employ workers to receive your items, stock them on a shelf, and then pick and ship them when you call an API.</p>



<p>We did some research into a few, which I included at the end, but most providers were focused on e-commerce or larger volumes. We ended out selecting <a href="https://www.shipbob.com/">ShipBob </a>because they had the most sensible pricing for this application.</p>



<p>Speaking of pricing, here’s how it works with ShipBob:</p>



<ul><li>You pay a <strong>receiving fee</strong> for each shipment you send to one of their warehouses. This is on the order of $25 and is insignificant if you’re restocking once or twice a year.</li><li>You pay a <strong>storage fee</strong> for each uniquely addressable item. This ranges from $5/mo – $40/mo depending on how much physical space they allocate to it. If you have 1 shirt in 2 colors and 5 sizes each, that’s 1*2*5=10 unique items. So consolidate your merch variations.</li><li>You pay a <strong>pick/pack</strong> fee for each item someone has to pack in a box… in theory. First several are free, and most orders are 1 or 2 items.</li><li>You pay <strong>shipping fees</strong> which are generally going to be less than what you’re paying now, unless you have a negotiated rate.</li></ul>



<p>All in all, our storage cost was about 1.5-2x what we were paying for a storage locker in Seattle, which feels reasonable to me. We were shipping enough that we had negotiated rates with UPS, so the shipping costs didn’t really change, but for most people that may offset some of the increase in storage.</p>



<p>And obviously this is probably saving a lot of money if you value your time highly.</p>



<h2>What About Print-on-Demand?</h2>



<p>If you’re going to ship a lot of swag, the pricing won’t work out, and the quality is also not amazing. (Not ideal for something you’re counting on people to wear for marketing.)</p>



<p>We’ve been trying Scalable Press for some of our really one-off items like a “CodeDay professional gamer” beanie we give out for our community gaming tournaments. The interface is really bad, but it can work for these use-cases.</p>



<h2>Where We Are Now</h2>



<p>CodeDay’s shipping infrastructure is now fully automated! For example, when a volunteer needs a new staff t-shirt, or some stickers for promotion, they just fill out a form, and a week later, it arrives in the mail. If we need to add something manually, we put it in ShipStation and it gets synced to ShipBob.</p>



<p>Every year, we order a year’s worth of supplies from our vendors and ship them to the warehouse. (Gorilla Screen Printing for shirts and hoodies, Zebra Prints for awards, Consolidated Label for holographic award stickers, Sticker Giant for other stickers, and GS-JJ for pins.)</p>



<p>We can go back to thinking about education! Everything is now magic!</p>

<h2>Fulfillment Partner Options</h2>



<h3>Amazon FBA</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Best prices on picking and shipping fees.</li><li>Presumably low rate of picking errors (since I’ve never gotten the wrong Amazon product).</li><li>Wide geographic distribution.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Complicated fee structure which is structured for e-commerce.</li><li>The “long-term storage fee.” Amazon wants high inventory turn-over, and fees increase substantially for items which are stored for more than a year.</li></ul>



<h3>Flexe</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible.</li><li>Wide network of partner warehouse.</li><li>Have CodeDay alums working for them. 🙂</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Highly flexible. Shipping isn’t our core competency so we want an opinionated solution.</li><li>Focused on higher volume sellers.</li></ul>



<h3>ShipBob (Our Pick)</h3>



<p>Pros:</p>



<ul><li>Own a decent number of warehouses in key markets.</li><li>Not too flexible, there is a “right way” to do it.</li><li>Documentation and pricing is less tied to e-commerce than other providers.</li><li>Reasonable fee structure (pay for shelf/pallet space, picking, and shipping) which is theoretically predictable.</li></ul>



<p>Cons:</p>



<ul><li>Higher picking error rate for visually similar items like shirts, even when items are barcoded.</li><li>Don’t consistently handle sets. A few times they have opened our sticker sets (a stapled bag labeled “THIS IS A SET DO NOT SEPARATE”) and sent people individual stickers.</li><li>Pricing is unpredictable in practice. Several times they have shipped a shirt in a 3′ cube box for $90, or stored a few small items on a pallet.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-980">
		
	
	<div>
		
<p>Let’s jump straight to the strange behavior: up until&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.configuration.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHP 7.2.16</a>&nbsp;it was possible by default to exfiltrate local files via the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/load-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL LOCAL INFILE feature</a> through the connection to a malicious MySQL server. Considering that the previous PHP versions are still <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the majority</a> in use, these exploits will remain useful for quite some time.</p>



<p>Like many other vulnerabilities, after reading about this&nbsp;<em>quite</em>-unknown attack technique (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2018/04/abusing-mysql-local-infile-to-read.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://russiansecurity.expert/2016/04/20/mysql-connect-file-read/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>), I could not wait to find a vulnerable software where to practice such unusual dynamic. The chance finally arrived after a network penetration test where&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/smaury92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@smaury</a>&nbsp;encountered&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.knowledgebase-script.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PHPKB</a>, a knowledge-base software written in PHP which he felt might be interesting to review, and that was my trigger.&nbsp;😏</p>



<p>After deploying it and having a look at the source code, I noticed that during the installation it was possible to test the database connection before actually starting to use it. After going back to review my <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burp</a> HTTP history, I discovered that the API endpoint wasn’t protected or removed after the configuration was completed, and hence it remained available for any unauthenticated user forever after. A PHPKB patch was released shortly after my report and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MITRE</a> assigned it <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>.</p>



<p>Moving on to the exploitation technique, despite it being around for quite some time the malicious servers available weren’t neither really&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/allyshka/Rogue-MySql-Server/blob/master/rogue_mysql_server.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debug-friendly</a>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://gist.github.com/bmaia/adc503231ffff19a77aaf0c7abd2e895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standalone</a>. That’s why I chose to invest some time to write one which met both those requirements — the result is available on&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/ShielderSec/CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. The script can work in two main modes:&nbsp;<code>server-only</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>exploit</code>. The exploit mode just adds the HTTP GET request needed to trigger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVE-2020-11579</a>, while the server-only exposes the malicious MySQL instance and waits for connections. For example, we can now exfiltrate an arbitrary file from a vulnerable PHPKB host in just one command:</p>

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

<figcaption>Becoming and Unbecoming. Macintosh Operating System 10.14.6, Preview.App 10.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<figcaption>Pointillism I. Sublime Text 3.2.2, ImageMagick 7.0.8–59</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3
# width, height, depth
10 10 1
0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Pointillism II. Vim 8.0.1365, FFmpeg 4.1.4</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<pre><code>P3
# horizontal, vertical, perchannel
10 10 1
0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1

0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1  0 0 1

</code></pre>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://beyondloom.com/blog/images-figures/iv.png" alt="Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0">
<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

<figcaption>The Cobbler. Sublime Text 3.2.2, as 10.0.1</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<pre><code>w:h:5
fc:1
draw:{,(;,"blue";5 5#0)}
</code></pre>

</figure>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<!-- For the record, this GIF was created in the Windows version of Krita 4.30. Thanks, Michal! -->

</figure>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<figcaption>Composition in Blue and Blue. Gnuplot 5.2, Sublime Text 3.2.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

It’s used because browsers operate at the HTTPS layer by default, so DNS-over-TLS doesn’t make sense (as things stand now) for a browser to implement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Google can’t use DNS-over-TLS in their browser because they can’t modify the code on Windows or MacOS operating systems (which only support DoT at the moment)&nbsp; in order to encrypt DNS requests done outside of the browser. And that works for Google and Firefox, because they only need to encrypt DNS requests </span><i><span>inside</span></i><span> of their browsers.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile at DNSFilter, we need to operate DNS encryption not just in the browser, but at the operating system level. That’s why we use DNS-over-TLS: Because it can be enabled at a </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> layer and protect DNS requests outside of the browser (e.g. Slack messages, links embedded in Excel, or miscellaneous desktop applications). And right now, DoT is the primary way to enable standardized DNS encryption at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Note that DoH is being enabled at the OS level for new versions of iOS, MacOS, and Windows. Because Android is a Google product, and Google Chrome uses DoH, Android devices are already using DoH at the operating system level.</span></p><h2><span>Which is better?</span></h2><p><span>DoH is on everyone’s minds because it’s what Google uses, but it’s not necessarily </span><i><span>better</span></i><span> than DoT. It’s just </span><i><span>different</span></i><span>, and in some ways it’s actually inferior to DoT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a lot of ways, DoT is more efficient because of which layer within the TCP/IP model it is enabled in. Remember, DoH is </span><b>two</b><span> layers removed from the internet layer while DoT is only </span><b>one</b><span> layer removed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Because there is another layer of encapsulation in DoH, it results in:</span></p><ul><li><span>More coding required</span></li><li><span>More libraries required</span></li><li><span>Packet sizes are larger than DoT</span></li><li><span>Ever-so-slightly higher latency</span></li></ul><p><span>These are a few of the reasons why DNSFilter chose DoT over DoH. Basically, we would have needed to send more data across another layer. Though it should be noted that both DoT </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> DoH increase latency, DoT has lower latency because of where it’s enabled.</span></p><p><span>But the most important reason for us, and our users, in choosing DoT was the ability to enable DNS encryption at the </span><i><span>lowest possible layer</span></i><span> since our users do not just send DNS requests over their browsers. That’s why we use DoT.</span></p><p><span>But that doesn’t mean we think DoT is the </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> answer. We </span><i><span>are</span></i><span> planning on having a DoH implementation for clients who need it.</span></p><p><span>As an example, Android devices, such as Chromebooks, use DoH. This is because Android devices were created by Google. While Windows and MacOS do not currently support DoH, Google was able to modify their Android devices so that DoH would be possible.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-is-adding-dns-over-https-doh-to-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Microsoft has even announced adding support for DoH</span></a><span>, while also keeping their DoT support.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though, just because Microsoft supports DoH for their operating system doesn’t mean the higher latency or additional coding requirements go away. No matter what, DoH is still implemented at a higher layer than DoT. The only change would be that now DoH can be implemented at the operating system level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This addition of DoH support is likely less about Microsoft giving their users more options and more about them following Google’s lead.</span></p><h2><span>Other DNS protocol variations</span></h2><p><span>DoH and DoT are not the only encryption protocols available, though at this point they are more robust and the most widely used. But before encryption standards were available, there was also DNSSEC.</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC was an early DNS standard that provided </span><i><span>no</span></i><span> encryption or privacy for your DNS requests. It </span><i><span>only</span></i><span> prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. And if it is not applied properly, it will </span><i><span>break</span></i><span> your website. </span><a href="https://ianix.com/pub/dnssec-outages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>You can check out a feed of websites broken by improper DNSSEC implementations here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>DNSSEC is prone to frequent outages and it was never widely adopted. Due to that, and because it only does a portion of what DoH and DoT do, are just a few reasons that at DNSFilter we don’t recommend using DNSSEC, though we do support it.</span></p><p><span>DNSCrypt is another DNS encryption option, though far less popular than the two protocols we’re comparing right now. Like DNS-over-TLS, it is applied at the transport layer. DNSCrypt prevents localized man-in-the-middle attacks and encrypts DNS traffic between the user and recursive DNS servers, though it does not provide end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the biggest difference between DNSCrypt and other standards (like DoT) is that there is no </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>RFC</span></a><span> (Request for Comments) like there is for DoH or DoT. This means it hasn’t been peer-reviewed and battle-tested. Implementations can vary greatly, and all of the definitions and specifications for DNSCrypt come from a single source.</span></p><p><span>You can access the RFCs for </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DoH</span></a><span> here.</span></p><h2><span>DNS encryption is </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> evolving</span></h2><p><span>There is no right answer when it comes to DoT or DoH, because these standards support varying use cases. But if DoH continues to be adopted like it has been, we might see DoT go by the wayside.</span></p><p><span>With that being said, it’s not just a matter of choosing DoT or DoH. There is still work that needs to be done in both DNS encryption </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> SNI (Server Name Indication) encryption.</span></p><p><span>SNI is the layer above TLS and an extension of the TLS layer. Once you make a DNS request and TLS makes a secure connection with that IP address, SNI tells the server in clear text (not encrypted) what the name of that domain is. While this does not impact things like man-in-the-middle attacks, it </span><i><span>does</span></i><span> impact privacy. Currently, SNI is </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> encrypted, though it is something that is being worked on.</span></p><p><span>While DoT and DoH are the most secure and standardized methods for encrypting DNS, they </span><i><span>do not</span></i><span> encrypt the request that goes to the authoritative DNS. That request is received in clear text. This is a point of vulnerability in both DoT and DoH, as well as DNSCrypt. Right now there is no standard for encrypting this information.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" data-src="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png" alt="authoritative dns" width="600" height="145" data-srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" srcset="https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526.png 1920w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-300x73.png 300w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1024x248.png 1024w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-768x186.png 768w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-1536x372.png 1536w, https://www.dnsfilter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DoT-or-DoH-Blog_07162020_AuthoritativeDNS-e1594910168526-500x121.png 500w"></p><p>As a DNS resolver, we support and welcome a standard for encrypting messages to authoritative DNS, and we’d love to work with providers to help put this in place.</p><p><span>But the point I’m trying to make here is that neither DoT nor DoH are perfect DNS encryption solutions at this moment. More work still needs to be done, like enabling 0-RTT for all DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS implementations.</span></p><p><span>While everyone is talking about DoH, it’s not because it’s the most secure or most efficient solution. It’s because right now, it’s the solution that’s getting the most press. </span><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/why-vhs-beat-betamax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>When VHS overtook Betamax</span></a><span>, it wasn’t because VHS was better in every way.

With DoH becoming the de facto standard, it makes performing DoH bypasses on system-level DNS settings nearly impossible. There’s no standard method at this time for alternative workarounds. We’ll go into this subject in more detail in a later blog post, as there is a lot to consider when discussing the impact on MSPs.</span></p><p><span>For more reading on DNS-over-TLS and how it’s implemented by DNSFilter, </span><a href="https://docs.dnsfilter.com/docs/dns-over-tls" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>visit our support documentation</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog post is my attempt to give an overview of the sub-field of machine learning interpretability. I do not intend for this post to be necessarily comprehensive, but my goal is to review conceptual frameworks, existing research, and future directions.</p>
<h2>What Are Existing Overviews?</h2>
<p>Most of these ideas are based heavily off of Zach Lipton's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03490.pdf">Mythos of Model Interpretability</a>, which I think is the best paper for understanding the different definitions of interpretability. For a deeper dive into specific techniques, I recommend <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01933.pdf">A Survey Of Methods For Explaining Black Box Models</a> which covers a wide variety of approaches for many different ML well as model-agnostic approaches. For neural nets specifically, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14545.pdf">Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated</a> provides an in-depth read. For other conceptual surveys of the field, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/44/22071">Definitions, methods, and applications in interpretable machine learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08883.pdf">Explainable Machine Learning for Scientific Insights and Discoveries</a>. The Explainable Machine Learning paper in particular is quite nice because it gives a hierarchy of increasingly more interpretable models across several domains and use cases.</p>
<p>(Shout-out to <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/d516daff247f7157fccde6649ace91d969cd1973/The-Mythos-of-Model-Interpretability/">Connected Papers</a> which made navigating the paper landscape for interpretability very bearable.)</p>
<p>As always, you can find code used to generate the images <a href="https://github.com/owenshen24/interp-exp">here</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we'll go over many ways to formalize what "interpretability" means. Broadly, interpretability focuses on the <em>how</em>. It's focused on getting some notion of an explanation for the decisions made by our models. Below, each section is operationalized by a concrete question we can ask of our ML model using a specific definition of interpretability. Before that, though, if you're new to all this, I'll explain briefly about why we might care about interpretability at all.</p>
<h2>Why Care About Interpretability?</h2>
<p>Firstly, interpretability in ML is useful because it can aid in trust. As humans, we may be reluctant to rely on ML models for certain critical tasks , e.g. medical diagnosis, unless we know "how they work". There's often a fear of unknown unknowns when trusting in something opaque, which we see when people confront new technology. Approaches to interpretability which focus on transparency could help mitigate some of these fears.</p>
<p>Secondly, safety. There is almost always some sort of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565v1.pdf">shift in distributions</a> between model training and deployment. Failures to generalize or Goodhart's Law issues like <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-AI-ingenuity">specification gaming</a> are still open problems that could lead to issues in the near future. Approaches to interpretability which explain the model's representations or which features are most relevant could help diagnose these issues earlier and provide more opportunities to intervene.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and perhaps most interestingly, contestability. As we delegate more decision-making to ML models, it becomes important for people to appeal these decisions made. Black-box models provide no such recourse because they don't decompose into anything that <em>can</em> be contested. This has already led to major criticism of proprietary recidivism predictors like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)#Critiques_and_legal_rulings">COMPAS</a>. Approaches to interpretability which focus on decomposing the model into sub-models or explicate a chain of reasoning could help with such appeals.</p>

<p>Lipton's paper breaks interpretability down into two types, transparency and post-hoc.</p>
<h2>Transparency Interpretability</h2>
<p>These three questions are from Lipton's section on transparency as interpretability, where he features on properties of the model that are useful to understand and can be known before training begins.</p>
<h3>Can a human walk through the model's steps? (Simulatibility)</h3>
<p>This property is about whether or not a human could go through each step of the algorithm and have it make sense to them at each step. Linear models and decision trees are often cited as interpretable models using such justifications; the computation they require is simple, no fancy matrix operations or nonlinear transformations.</p>
<p>Linear models are also nice because the parameters themselves have a very direct mapping–they represent how important different input features are. For example, I trained a linear classifier on MNIST, and here are some of the weights, each of which correspond to a pixel value:</p>
<pre><code>0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  3.90594519e-05,  7.10306823e-05,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00, -1.47542413e-03,
-1.67811041e-04, -3.83280468e-02, -8.10846867e-02, -5.01943218e-02,
-2.90314621e-02, -2.65494116e-02, -8.29385683e-03,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  1.67390785e-04,  3.92789141e-04,  0.00000000e+00,
0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00
</code></pre>
<p>By themselves, these weights are hard to interpret. Even if we knew which pixels they corresponded to, it's difficult to try and pin down what a certain pixel even represents for large images. However, there is an easy trick to turn these weights into something interpretable. We simply reshape them into the same shape as our model and view it as an image, with the pixel color represented by the weight value.</p>
<p>Here are the weights for the model that looks for 0:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-0.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 0 highlighted"></p>
<p>And here are the weights for the model that looks for 3:</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/linear-3.png" alt="a picture of a grid with 3 highlighted"></p>
<p>In both cases, we can see that the blue regions, which represent positive weight, correspond to a configuration of pixels that look roughly like the digit being detected for. In the case of 0, we can see a distinct blank spot in the center of the image and a curve-like shape around it, whereas the curves of the 3 are also apparent.</p>
<p>However, Lipton points out that this desiderata can be less about the specific choice of model and more about the <em>size</em> of the model. A decision tree with a billion nodes, for example, may still be difficult to understand. Understanding is also about being able to hold most of the model in your mind, which is often about how the model is parameterized.</p>
<p>One approach towards achieving this for neural nets is <a href="http://www.shallowmind.co/jekyll/pixyll/2017/12/30/tree-regularization/">tree regularization</a> which adds a regularization term that corresponds (roughly) to the size of the decision tree that can approximate the net being trained. The hope here is to eventually output a shallow decision tree that performs comparably to a neural net. Another approach is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00221.pdf">neural backed decision trees</a> which use another type of regularization to learn a hierarchy over class labels, which then get used to form a decision tree.</p>
<p>Of course, parameterization is not the whole story. There are methods like K-Nearest Neighbors which are parameterized by your entire dataset; this could be billions of points. Yet, there is a sense in which KNN is still interpretable despite its massive size. We can cleanly describe what the algorithm does, and we can even see "why" it made such a choice because the algorithm is so simple.</p>
<h3>Is the model interpretable at every step, or with regards to its sub-components? (Decomposability)</h3>
<p>Another desirable feature would be to understand what the model is doing at each step. For example, imagine a decision tree whose nodes correspond to easily identifiable factors like age or height. This can sometimes be difficult because model performance is very tightly coupled with the representations used. Raw features, e.g. RGB pixel values, are often not very interpretable by themselves, but interpretable features may not be the most informative for the model.</p>
<p>For example, I trained a decision tree for MNIST using the following interpretable features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The average brightness of the image - <code>avg_lumin</code></li>
<li>The average brightness of the image's outline (found using an edge detector) - <code>edge_prop</code></li>
<li>The number of corners found in the image's outline <code>num_corners</code></li>
<li>The width of the image - <code>max_width</code></li>
<li>The height of the image - <code>max_height</code></li>
</ol>
<p>It seems like there would be at least <em>some</em> useful information in these features; ones tend to have less area (so <code>avg_lumin</code> would be lower), eights might have more corners, etc. etc. Yet, the resulting decision tree of depth 3, shown below, however, only achieves 33% training accuracy. Going all the way to depth 10 only bumps it to around 50%.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/interp_mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a decision tree trained on MNIST with interpretable features"></p>
<p>If we look at the nodes, we can perhaps see what's going on. At the top, we can see that our model will predict a 1 if the width is less than 7.5 pixels, which makes sense as 1 is likely going to be the thinnest digit. Near the bottom, we see that the number of corners is being used to differentiate between 7 and 4. And 4s do have more visual corners than 7s. But this is very rough, and the overall performance is still not very good.</p>
<p>To compare this with raw features, I also trained a depth 3 decision tree using direct pixel values, i.e. a vector of 784 grayscale values. The resulting model, shown below, gets 50% train and test accuracy.</p>
<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/mnist_decision_tree.png" alt="a normal decision tree trained on MNIST"></p>
<p>Here, it's not clear at all why these pixel values were chosen to be the splitting points. And yet the resulting decision tree, for the same number of nodes, does much better. In this simple case, the performance vs interpretability trade-off in representation is quite apparent.</p>
<h3>Does the algorithm itself confer any guarantees? (Algorithmic Transparency)</h3>
<p>This asks if our learning algorithm has any properties which make it easy to understand. For example, we might know that the algorithm only outputs sparse models, or perhaps it always converges to a certain type of solution. In these cases, the resulting learned model can be more amenable to analysis. For example, the <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Labs/UniquenessOfSVM.pdf">Hard Margin SVM</a> is guaranteed to find a unique solution which maximizes the margin. In another vein, the <a href="https://owenshen24.github.io/perceptron/">perceptron</a> is guaranteed to find parameters (not necessarily unique ones, though) that achieve a training loss of 0 if the data are linearly separable.</p>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, I'm less familiar with these kinds of results. My rough understanding is that the equivalence class of models which achieve comparable training error can be quite large, even with regularization, which makes uniqueness results hard to come by.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier with KNN, it seems, aside from mechanical transparency, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a data company, data ethics has always been important to us, but in the last few years, as Machine learning and AI have become front and centre as a significant part of digital transformation in the enterprise, data ethics has become a hot topic. It bears such a considerable weight in predictive analytics, not just in conveying trust to consumers of machine intelligence, but also in ensuring predictive models deliver genuine value, make unbiased predictions, and reflect the true state of the environment within which they live. When data ethics go wrong, it can go badly wrong, potentially bringing down an entire organisation, with substantial direct and indirect collateral damage, potentially even on national democracy and social cohesion - the Cambridge Analytica incident a case in point.</p><p>We all need to take it seriously.</p><p>In 2018 Data Language was privileged to have been accepted onto the Digital Catapult “<a href="https://www.digicatapult.org.uk/for-startups/acceleration-programmes/machine-intelligence-garage">Machine Intelligence Garage</a>” programme. As well as supporting us with a terrific programme including compute resource, strategic help and industry engagement, Digital Catapult also took Data Language through their ethics programme. This was like a cold-shower, really waking us up to depth and breadth of data ethics. A realisation that data ethics is not just about data (technically), but about the way you approach your entire business. </p><p>With all this in mind, we were motivated to develop a data ethics framework that we could use internally at Data Language to assess all our predictive analytics projects, and that could guide us practically during implementation. We call this framework BOTT.</p><h2 id="the-bott-framework">The BOTT Framework</h2><p>BOTT (all good frameworks need a memorable acronym) stands for Bias, Outcome, Target and Trust. Through these four pillars, it allows our data science team to examine, and assess a predictive analytics model within its local and external ecosystem for quality, bias, and accuracy, and ensure it meets high standards of data ethics.</p><figure><img src="https://images.datalanguage.com/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg" alt="Data Language BOTT Data Ethics Framework" srcset="https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1000/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1000w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w1600/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 1600w, https://images.datalanguage.com/size/w2400/2020/07/3a-withDL.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="bias">Bias</h3><p>An analysis of potential bias that may be baked into the model during its life-cycle, either literally through data or code, or intangibly through for example, some conscious or subconscious human bias. We examine bias from the following perspectives :</p><p><em><strong>Training data bias</strong></em> - is the training data diverse enough and comprehensive enough to accurately reflect the environment of the predictive model. What potential biases might skew predictive results either for good or bad outcomes - is there any chance these biases might exist in the training data we have used.</p><p><em><strong>Algorithmic bias</strong></em><strong> </strong>- is the model algorithm, its mathematical basis, or code potentially biased?</p><p><em><strong>Real-time input data</strong></em><strong> </strong>- if real-time (predict time) input data is involved in making some prediction, what might these data biases be, and how can we prevent them from impacting outputs.</p><p><strong><em>Team bias</em></strong> - has or could conscious or unconscious bias of the model development team contribute to model bias, and have we mitigated against it. Often just an open and frank team discussion around bias (with respect to the project under consideration) is enough to flush out these sort of issues</p><p><strong><em>Political, environmental, and social bias</em> </strong>- similar to the team bias but looking at potential external factors through a similar lens - for both ideally the team needs to be very comfortable talking about potentially politically or socially sensitive topics in an open, friendly and non-defensive manner.</p><p><strong><em>Output sampling</em></strong> - essentially QA - have you done effective output sampling and for quality assurance - does the risk of bias in the predictive model call for independent third party reviews in QA workflows, etc</p><h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3><p>An analysis and survey of the full range of possible outcomes of the model:</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - construct a catalogue of the potential outcome scenarios</p><p><strong><em>Impact</em></strong> - What does success and failure of the model mean :</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>

<li>model failure consequences, e.g. could somebody die if the model fails ?</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="target">Target</h3><p>Analysis of who or what the model is targeted at and the context in which these users operate.</p><p><strong><em>Users</em></strong> - &nbsp;Who are target users of the model &nbsp;- who or what is the direct consumer of the model ?</p><p><strong><em>Purpose</em></strong> - What problem is the model solving?</p><p><strong><em>Context</em>: </strong>Is it part of an ensemble of models, is there a wider predictive ecosystem the model sits within - what impact does this model have within this context ?</p><p><strong><em>Life span</em></strong> - &nbsp;What is the life expectancy of the model, and how does its environment change over time</p><p><strong><em>Subversion</em> </strong> - Can other users or consumers subvert the model for unintended/undesirable ends?</p><p><strong><em>Catalogue</em></strong> - Construct &nbsp;a catalogue of potential unintended uses/consequences, and ascertain if those vulnerabilities can be designed out of the architecture?</p><h3 id="trust">Trust</h3><p>Providing some visibility of the "behind the scenes" implementation can raise confidence in the models and foster a trust relationship between consumers and predictive services.</p><p><strong><em>Explainable AI</em></strong> (XAI) is becoming a field in its own right, and an important part of machine learning and predictive analytics.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Most of the programming languages are open enough to allow programmers doing things multiple ways for the similar outcome. JavaScript is no way different. With JavaScript, we often find multiple ways of doing things for a similar outcome, and that's confusing at times.</p>
<p>Some of the usages are better than the other alternatives and thus, these are my favorites. I am going to list them here in this article. I am sure, you will find many of these in your list too.</p>
<h2 id="1-forget-string-concatenation-use-template-string-literal-">1. Forget string concatenation, use template string(literal)</h2>
<p>Concatenating strings together using the <code>+</code> operator to build a meaningful string is old school. Moreover, concatenating strings with dynamic values(or expressions) could lead to frustrations and bugs.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageConcat = <span>'Mr. '</span> + name + <span>' is from '</span> + place + <span>'. He is a'</span> + <span>' '</span> + isPrime(<span>'P'</span>) + <span>' member.'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Template literals(or Template strings) allow embedding expressions. It has got unique syntax where the string has to be enclosed by the backtick (``).  Template string can contain placeholders for dynamic values. These are marked by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}).</p>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating it,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> name = <span>'Charlse'</span>;
<span>let</span> place = <span>'India'</span>;
<span>let</span> isPrime = bit =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> (bit === <span>'P'</span> ? <span>'Prime'</span> : <span>'Nom-Prime'</span>);
}


<span>let</span> messageTemplateStr = <span>`Mr. <span>${name}</span> is from <span>${place}</span>. He is a <span>${isPrime('P')}</span> member.`</span>
<span>console</span>.log(messageTemplateStr);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-isinteger">2. isInteger</h2>
<p>There is a much cleaner way to know if a value is an integer. The <code>Number</code> API of JavaScript provides a method called, <code>isInteger()</code> to serve this purpose. It is very useful and better to be aware.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> mynum = <span>123</span>;
<span>let</span> mynumStr = <span>"123"</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynum}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynum));
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${mynumStr}</span> is a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(mynumStr));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930285107/RiLxixUxC.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="2.png"></p>
<h2 id="3-value-as-number">3. Value as Number</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed, <code>event.target.value</code> always returns a string type value even when the input box is of type number?</p>
<p>Yes, see the example below. We have a simple text box of type number. It means it accepts only numbers as input. It has an event handler to handle the key-up events.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span>=<span>'number'</span> <span>onkeyup</span>=<span>"trackChange(event)"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the event handler method we take out the value using <code>event.target.value</code>. But it returns a string type value. Now I will have additional headache to parse it to an integer. What if the input box accepts floating numbers(like, 16.56)? parseFloat() then? Ah, all sort of confusions and extra work!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>trackChange</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   <span>let</span> value = event.target.value;
   <span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(value));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>event.target.valueAsNumber</code> instead. It returns the value as number.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> valueAsNumber = event.target.valueAsNumber;
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`is <span>${value}</span> a number?`</span>, <span>Number</span>.isInteger(valueAsNumber));
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595935455526/Tv1sEFRxe.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="3.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-short-hand-with-and">4. Short hand with AND</h2>
<p>Lets consider a situation where we have a boolean value and a function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isPrime = <span>true</span>;
<span>const</span> startWatching = () =&gt; {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Started Watching!'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is too much code to check for the boolean condition and invoke the function,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (isPrime) {
    startWatching();
}
</code></pre>
<p>How about using the short-hand using the AND(&amp;&amp;) operator? Yes, avoid <code>if</code> statement altogether. Cool, right?</p>
<pre><code>isPrime &amp;&amp; startWatching();
</code></pre>
<h2 id="5-default-value-with-or">5. Default value with OR</h2>
<p>If you ever like to set a default value for a variable, you can do it using the OR(||) operator easily.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> person = {name: <span>'Jack'</span>};
<span>let</span> age = person.age || <span>35</span>; 
<span>console</span>.log(<span>`Age of <span>${person.name}</span> is <span>${age}</span>`</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="6-randoms">6. Randoms</h2>
<p>Generating random number or getting a random item from an array are very useful methods to keep handy. I have seen them appearing multiple times in many of my projects.</p>
<p>Get a random item from an array,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> planets = [<span>'Mercury '</span>, <span>'Mars'</span>, <span>'Venus'</span>, <span>'Earth'</span>, <span>'Neptune'</span>, <span>'Uranus'</span>, <span>'Saturn'</span>, <span>'Jupiter'</span>];
<span>let</span> randomPlanet = planets[<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>Math</span>.random() * planets.length)];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>'Random Planet'</span>, randomPlanet);
</code></pre>
<p>Generate a random number from a range by specifying the min and max values,</p>
<pre><code> <span>let</span> getRandom = (min, max) =&gt; {
     <span>return</span> <span>Math</span>.round(<span>Math</span>.random() * (max - min) + min);
 }
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Get random'</span>, getRandom(<span>0</span>, <span>10</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="7-function-default-params">7. Function default params</h2>
<p>In JavaScript, function arguments(or params) are like local variables to that function. You may or may not pass values for those while invoking the function. If you do not pass a value for a param, it will be <code>undefined</code> and may cause some unwanted side effects.</p>
<p>There is a simple way to pass a default value to the function parameters while defining them. Here is an example where we are passing the default value <code>Hello</code> to the parameter <code>message</code> of the <code>greetings</code> function.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name, message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;
}

<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>));
<span>console</span>.log(greetings(<span>'Jack'</span>, <span>'Hola!'</span>));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="8-required-function-params">8. Required Function Params</h2>
<p>Expanding on the default parameter technique, we can mark a parameter as mandatory. First define a function to throw an error with an error message,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> isRequired = () =&gt; {
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span>(<span>'This is a mandatory parameter.'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then assign the function as the default value for the required parameters. Remember, the default values are ignored when a value is passed for a parameter at the invocation time. But, the default value is considered if the parameter value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> greetings = (name=isRequired(), message=<span>'Hello,'</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> <span>`<span>${message}</span> <span>${name}</span>`</span>;
}
<span>console</span>.log(greetings());
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, <code>name</code> will be undefined and that will try to set the default value for it which is the <code>isRequired()</code> function. It will throw an error as,</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930079306/ossRyuA7X.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="8.png"></p>
<h2 id="9-comma-operator">9. Comma Operator</h2>
<p>I was surprised when I realized, comma(,) is a separate operator and never gone noticed. I have been using it so much in code but, never realized its true existence.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the comma(,) operator is used for evaluating each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> count = <span>1</span>;
<span>let</span> ret = (count++, count);
<span>console</span>.log(ret);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the value of the variable <code>ret</code> will be, 2.  Similar way, the output of the following code will be logging the value 32 into the console.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> val = (<span>12</span>, <span>32</span>);
<span>console</span>.log(val);
</code></pre>
<p>Where do we use it? Any guesses? The most common usage of the comma(,) operator is to supply multiple parameters in a for loop.</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>var</span> i = <span>0</span>, j = <span>50</span>; i &lt;= <span>50</span>; i++, j--)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="10-merging-multiple-objects">10.  Merging multiple objects</h2>
<p>You may have a need to merge two objects together and create a better informative object to work with. You can use the spread operator <code>...</code>(yes, three dots!).</p>
<p>Consider two objects, emp and job respectively,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emp = {
 <span>'id'</span>: <span>'E_01'</span>,
 <span>'name'</span>: <span>'Jack'</span>,
 <span>'age'</span>: <span>32</span>,
 <span>'addr'</span>: <span>'India'</span>
};

<span>let</span> job = {
 <span>'title'</span>: <span>'Software Dev'</span>,
  <span>'location'</span>: <span>'Paris'</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Merge them using the spread operator as,</p>
<pre><code> 
 <span>let</span> merged = {...emp, ...job};
 <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Spread merged'</span>, merged);
</code></pre>
<p>There is another way to perform this merge. Using <code>Object.assign()</code>. You can do it like,</p>
<pre><code> <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Object assign'</span>, <span>Object</span>.assign({}, emp, job));
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595930544621/2jCCxCSnz.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="10.png"></p>
<p>Note, both spread operator and the Object.assign perform a shallow merge. In a shallow merge, the properties of the first object are overwritten with the same property values of the second object.</p>
<p>For deep merge, please use something like, <code>_merge</code> of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a>.</p>
<h2 id="11-destructuring">11. Destructuring</h2>
<p>The technique of breaking down the array elements and object properties as variables called, <code>destructuring</code>.  Let us see it with few examples,</p>
<h3 id="array">Array</h3>
<p>Here we have an array of emojis,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>To destructure, we would use a syntax as follows,</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fire, clock, , watermelon] = emojis;
</code></pre>
<p>This is same as doing, <code>let fire = emojis[0];</code> but with lots more flexibility.
Have you noticed, I have just ignored the trophy emoji using an empty space in-between? So what will be the output of this?</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(fire, clock, watermelon);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595931639636/TXaeEwgGq.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.png"></p>
<p>Let me also introduce something called <code>rest</code> operator here. If you want to destructure an array such that, you want to assign one or more items to variables and park rest of it into another array, you can do that using <code>...rest</code> as shown below.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> [fruit, ...rest] = emojis;
<span>console</span>.log(rest);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932001526/GdWuvDoP8.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.a.png"></p>
<h3 id="object">Object</h3>
<p>Like arrays we can also destructure objects. </p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shape = {
  name: <span>'rect'</span>,
  sides: <span>4</span>,
  height: <span>300</span>,
  width: <span>500</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>Destructuring such that, we get name, sides in couple of variables and rest are in another object.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> {name, sides, ...restObj} = shape;
<span>console</span>.log(name, sides);
<span>console</span>.log(restObj);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595932176160/97vWj-QQl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="11.b.png"></p>
<p>Read more about this topic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment">from here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="12-swap-variables">12. Swap variables</h2>
<p>This must be super easy now using the concept of <code>destructuring</code> we learned just now.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> fire = <span>'🔥'</span>;
<span>let</span> fruit = <span>'🍉'</span>;

[fruit, fire] = [fire, fruit];
<span>console</span>.log(fire, fruit);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="13-isarray">13. isArray</h2>
<p>Another useful method for determining if an input is an Array or not.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> emojis = [<span>'🔥'</span>, <span>'⏲️'</span>, <span>'🏆'</span>, <span>'🍉'</span>];
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(emojis));

<span>let</span> obj = {};
<span>console</span>.log(<span>Array</span>.isArray(obj));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="14-undefined-vs-null">14. undefined vs null</h2>
<p><code>undefined</code> is where a value is not defined for a variable but, the variable has been declared. </p>
<p><code>null</code> itself is an empty and non-existent value which must be assigned to a variable explicitly.</p>
<p><code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are not strictly equal,</p>
<pre><code><span>undefined</span> === <span>null</span> 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="15-get-query-params">15. Get Query Params</h2>
<p><code>window.location</code> object has bunch of utility methods and properties. We can get information about protocol, host, port, domain etc from the browser urls using these properties and methods. </p>
<p>One of the properties that I found very useful is,</p>
<pre><code><span>window</span>.location.search
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>search</code> property returns the query string from the location url. Here is an example url: <code>https://tapasadhiary.com?project=js</code>. The <code>location.search</code> will return, <code>?project=js</code></p>
<p>We can use another useful interface called, <code>URLSearchParams</code> along with <code>location.search</code> to get the value of the query parameters.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> project = <span>new</span> URLSearchParams(location.search).get(<span>'project'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Output:
<code>js</code></p>

<p><strong>When we first</strong> <strong>conceived of Density six years ago</strong>, we just wanted to know if there was a line at our favorite coffee shop. We thought it was odd there was an API for inclement weather but there wasn't an API for how many people were in a space. We reasoned, if a solution didn't already exist â€” which surely it must â€” it shouldn't be more than a weekend project. How hard could it be to count people?</p>



<p>We were optimistic and wrong by about three years. As we tried to solve our own problem, we learned two important lessons. First, people are weird. They do things you wouldn't expect â€” they bump into each other, take phone calls, and they bring a lot of stuff with them: bags and boxes, bicycles and baskets, tv's and trash cans, chairs, carts, iPads, lunch, even other people sometimes. This makes counting them unfathomably complex. You can't fault commodity products for being bad at the analysis. People are just really weird.</p>



<p>Second, we learned we weren't alone. We met hundreds and now thousands of others trying to answer the same question â€” how many people used my office, bank, lounge, desk, space, floor, building, campusâ€¦ city. If only we knew, we could reduce waste and energy use, improve access and productivity, clean the spaces that need it and skip the ones that don't. If only we knew, we could A/B test physical space or even use less concrete! If only we knew how the world was used, we could measure how it works, identify its inefficiencies, and remake it.</p>



<p>Until recently, we had been helping hundreds of companies do just this â€” quantify how buildings were used so they could design them more effectively. Today, things have changed. We've been asked to help those same companies and hundreds more reopen their buildings and businesses safely. We're helping them avoid leases they don't need in order to prioritize payroll. We're working to keep meat processing plants, distribution centers, manufacturers, offices, universities, even an entire village in Ohio open and safe.</p>



<p>The built world was modernizing before the pandemic. It will continue to modernize well after it's over. In the meantime, we're proud to say we're not going anywhere and we're eager to help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Digital microwaves show an example of good UI doing what you wanted</h2>

	<p><small>July 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often, you encounter a bit of UI that does what you mean
to do so transparently that you don't even notice that the UI is
breaking its own 'how it works' rules to do so. You could say that
this is the complete reverse of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/UnixAnnoyance">robot logic</a>,
as seen yesterday in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/PamPasswdErrorFail">trying to change your password on Linux</a>. Recently I realized that I'd run
into such a 'do what I mean even though it doesn't fit' UI in plain
ordinary microwaves, of all places.</p>

<p>Your typical microwave has a 0-9 digital pad for entering the cooking
time and its cook time is set in MM:SS. If you want one minute and
twenty seconds, you punch in '1 2 0' and the microwave displays '1:20'
and counts down from there. This is all perfectly logical and sensible,
and forms a clear model of how the microwave behaves.</p>

<p>So what happens if you enter '9 0'? The microwave doesn't reject
this as an error because you can't have 90 seconds in the seconds
portion of a minutes and seconds time (you can have at most 59).
Instead it breaks the model and gives you 90 seconds of cook time.
This creates some inconsistencies, of course; if you enter '9 9'
you get 99 seconds, but if you enter '1 0 0', you get 60 seconds
(because now it's 1:00 cook time). On at least some microwaves
this still works even if you enter more than two digits; '1 9 9'
is 199 seconds, not an error (or one minute plus 99 seconds).</p>

<p>This behavior was so natural and so obviously correct and what I meant
that I spent years not realizing there was anything unusual about
it. Only one day as I was keying in '9 0' yet again and congratulating
myself on pressing one less digit than '1 3 0' did I stop to ask myself
why it even worked. And the answer is that the microwave makers went out
of their way to figure out what this input should mean so that it should
match user expectations, and make it so.</p>

<p>(I suspect or at least hope that there were user studies by some early
microwave company on what people expected to happen when they keyed in
various number sequences that weren't proper MM:SS setups.)</p>

  <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>When running a production Kubernetes cluster, one of the most important (and burdensome) tasks is keeping everything up-to-date. Kubernetes itself cuts quarterly releases, which quickly fall out of support—if you fail to upgrade, you could be left open to security holes and buggy features. Fortunately, the quarterly cadence at least makes these releases predictable: you can even set a reminder to go through the process every three months.</p>

<p><span>Source: <a href="https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/</a></span></p>
<p>But on top of Kubernetes, you probably have half a dozen add-ons running in your cluster, most likely installed&nbsp;<a href="https://helm.sh/"> <span>via Helm</span></a>. Supplementary components like nginx-ingress, cert-manager and linkerd are often critical to running a production-grade cluster. You might even be using k8s-specific deployments for common applications like PostgreSQL or Wordpress. Each of these tools has its own release cadence, and some updates may come with critical security patches.</p>
<p>Installing a new patch typically isn’t that hard - usually it just means rerunning a <span><code>helm install,</code></span>&nbsp;command, or updating a single line in your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/why-infrastructure-as-code-kubernetes"> <span>Infrastructure-as-Code</span></a> repository. But how do you know <em>when</em> it’s time to update? Unlike Kubernetes itself, Helm chart updates are incredibly hard to monitor and predict.</p>
<h2><strong>Observe and Report</strong></h2>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/FairwindsOps/Nova/"><span>Nova</span></a>, an open source tool by Fairwinds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. <a href="https://ctt.ac/8q0Af" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Click to Tweet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nova is a command-line interface for cross-checking the Helm charts running in your cluster with the latest versions available. Nova will let you know if you’re running a chart that’s out-of-date or deprecated, so you can make sure you’re always aware of updates.</p>
<pre><code>Release Name      Installed    Latest     Old     Deprecated
cert-manager      v0.11.0      v0.15.2    true    false
insights-agent    0.21.1       0.21.1     false   false
grafana           2.1.3        3.1.1      true    false
metrics-server    2.8.8        2.11.1     true    false
nginx-ingress     1.25.0       1.40.3     true    false
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to see how far behind you are on any installed Helm charts. In the example above, we’ve got the latest version of <span><code>insights-agent,</code></span>but there are minor updates available for some core infrastructure, including <span><code>cert-manager,</code><code>nginx-ingress,</code></span>and <span><code>metrics-server.</code></span><span><span><code>grafana</code></span></span>also has a new major version available, so we might be missing out on some cool new features!</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>This turned out to be a harder problem than expected.</p>
<p>The first issue was in supporting both Helm 2 and Helm 3. Helm 2 stored chart metadata using ConfigMaps, which were fairly easy to parse. But Helm 3 uses Secrets, along with some byzantine encoding practices. With some help from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/blog/kubernetes-easily-find-deprecated-api-versions-with-pluto"> <span>the Pluto team</span></a>, we built support for both versions, as well as the ability to auto-detect charts from both versions. You can use this feature by specifying <span><code>--helm-version=auto.</code></span></p>
<p>Even more challenging was matching the installed chart to the upstream source. Unfortunately, Helm doesn’t store info about the upstream repository in the chart metadata, making an exact match impossible. All we have to go on is the name, which might be duplicated across different repositories. For example, many of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/"> <span>the Bitnami charts</span></a> were recently migrated out of the<a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/"> <span>core charts repo</span></a>, but kept the same names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find a match, we have to look in <em>all</em> known repositories for charts with a matching name, then use heuristics like the chart’s <span><code>version, home, description,</code></span> and <span><code>maintainers</code></span> to find a good match. So far this strategy has a 100% success rate, but it feels like a bit of a hack. If you know of a better solution for finding the upstream repository for an installed Helm chart, let us know!</p>
<h2><strong>Putting it into Practice</strong></h2>
<p>Nova saves a lot of time and effort for anyone looking to keep their charts up-to-date. Instead of having to monitor each individual chart for updates, operators can now run a single CLI to detect old versions running in their cluster. But you still have to remember to run the CLI!</p>
<p>When managing hundreds of clusters, the chances of forgetting to run Nova on a particular cluster, misreading the output, or failing to act on the results, are all but certain at scale. Furthermore, some organizations <em>need</em> to be on an older version of a given tool (in particular, <span><code>cert-manager</code></span> has regularly introduced breaking changes). So we needed a way to operationalize Nova at scale.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fairwinds.com/insights"> <span>Fairwinds Insights</span></a>. Insights can run Nova (along with other Kubernetes auditing tools) automatically on a regular schedule—every hour by default—and use the results to create&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.docs.fairwinds.com/features/action-items/"> <span>Action Items</span></a>. These Action Items serve as a reminder to update your Helm Chart, and can be piped to Slack, Datadog, or anywhere else your engineers live.</p>
<p>Internally, we also maintain a YAML file that includes a set of standards - particular versions of each add-on that we expect our clients to run. We use Nova to make sure that YAML file stays up-to-date with the latest versions, and to keep our Infrastructure-as-Code in line with those standards.</p>

<p>Automatically checking Helm charts for updates solves a big problem for us at Fairwinds, and for the Kubernetes community as a whole. But the ecosystem moves fast, and there are many more pieces of software and infrastructure that we need to stay on top of. Other things we’d like to build automated checks for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported k8s versions on managed Kubernetes providers (like GKE, EKS, and AKS)</li>
<li>Docker tags (at least where semver tagging practices are used)</li>
<li>Docker base images</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether these checks fit into Nova, or will justify creating a separate project, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any domain, staying on top of the latest releases is a big, scary problem. We hope Nova helps the Kubernetes community keep their clusters reliable and secure.</p>

But as more and more topics become too risky to discuss outside of the prevailing orthodoxies, it makes sense to constantly self-censor, feeling unbound only when part of a denunciatory pack. </p><p>Institutions that are supposed to be guardians of free expression—academia and journalism in particular—are becoming enforcers of conformity. Campuses have bureaucracies that routinely undermine free speech and due process. Now, these practices are breaching the ivy wall. They are coming to a high school or corporate HR office near you.</p><p>The cultural rules around hot button issues are ever-expanding. It’s as if a daily script went out describing what’s acceptable, and those who flub a line—or don’t even know a script exists—are rarely given the benefit of the doubt, no matter how benign their intent. Naturally, people are deciding the best course is to shut up. It makes sense to be part of the silenced majority when the price you pay for an errant tweet or remark can be the end of your livelihood. </p><p>Do these problems really matter so long as we have a president who daily tramples on rights, civil discourse, and the rule of law? They do. Of course, we must keep our focus on the danger this administration presents. But it is also our moral and strategic obligation to vigorously defend the principles of a free society. Upholding these values will help us defeat Trumpism. </p><p>The process by which sinners are punished and apostates expelled can seem random. But there are rules and patterns to the ways in which speech is being silenced. Analyzing and understanding these can help us stand up to the illiberalism of this moment, whether it comes from the left or the right. </p><p>To that end, here is my taxonomy of fear. </p><p><strong>The Perils of Safety </strong></p><p>James Bennet’s resignation from his position as the editorial page editor of the <em>New York Times</em> quickly became the genesis story of today’s debate about “cancel culture.” Bennet was pressured to depart after he ran an op-ed by Tom Cotton, a Republican Senator from Arkansas, whose argument that the military should be used to respond to riots caused an uproar among the paper’s staff.</p><p>At first, A. G. Sulzberger, the paper’s publisher, publicly expressed his support for the decision to run the op-ed. But that quickly changed after Black employees asserted not just that Cotton’s argument was morally repugnant, or that he failed to make it in a way that met the <em>Times</em>’ standards, but that the piece threatened their lives. “Running this puts Black @nytimes staff in danger,” many of them tweeted.</p><p>The language used by the <em>Times </em>staffers is indicative of a wider trend. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224897">The Coddling of the American Mind</a>,</em> Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt describe the recent emergence and rapid spread on college campuses of what they call “safetyism,” a view that “equates emotional discomfort with physical danger.” Safetyism, they write, teaches students “to see words as violence and interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous.”</p><p>Confronted with words, ideas, or decisions they dislike, a growing number of people are asserting that they are in danger of suffering psychological or even bodily harm. But when one party asserts that a debate threatens their very well-being, it is hard to deliberate on policy—or topics such as race and gender. The result is a narrowing of the space for public discussion and an inability to teach ever more ideas and books. </p><p>As Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen has chronicled in the <em>New Yorker</em>, for example, law professors find it increasingly difficult to teach rape law because some students consider the subject too disturbing. “Student organizations representing women’s interests now routinely advise students that they should not feel pressured to attend or participate in class sessions that focus on the law of sexual violence, and which might therefore be traumatic,” she writes. “Some students have even suggested that rape law should not be taught because of its potential to cause distress.” </p><p>But, as Suk Gersen has pointed out, it was feminists who fought for the overhaul of deeply sexist rape laws, and it is sexual assault victims who will be hurt if lawyers do not learn about the subject. In practice, safetyism will make some of the most vulnerable people in our society less safe.</p><p><strong>Contamination by Association</strong></p><p>Recently, more than 150 writers and academics (including Yascha Mounk and I) signed a public letter defending open debate. Shortly after, transgender writer Emily VanDerWerff shared on Twitter a note of <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyvdw/status/1280580388495097856">complaint</a> she had written to her editors, stating that the letter had rendered her “less safe at <em>Vox</em>” because Matt Yglesias, one of <em>Vox’s</em> co-founders, was among its signatories.</p><p>How could signing a letter decrying the intolerant atmosphere on the left render a colleague less safe? Because, VanDerWerff argues, the letter was also signed by people she characterized as “prominent anti-trans voices.” Though the letter itself made no mention of trans issues, and VanDerWerff has never accused Yglesias himself of expressing objectionable views on the subject, this, she claims, was enough to harm her.</p><p>VanDerWerff’s note certainly illustrates safetyism. Going one step further, it also assumes the truth of a principle of “contamination by association.” People, the logic goes, cannot only be made unsafe by the beliefs or statements of their colleagues but also by those with whom their colleagues associate. </p><p>In this view, the contamination is ruthless and insidious. As VanDerWerff asserts, not only is Yglesias now responsible for the views of all the signers of the letter; she is also concerned that readers and sources may now assume that <em>she herself </em>shares those views because she works with Yglesias. If the principle of “contamination by association” were to be adopted this broadly, people would soon be answerable for the work of the co-signatories on a letter, for those with whom they have appeared on a panel, for those they might talk to on a podcast, and for countless others with whom they share the most tenuous of professional connections. </p><p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/shadi-hamid/">Shadi Hamid</a> is a Muslim scholar of Islamist movements; to do his work, he needs to talk to people who hold ideas many find objectionable. His willingness to engage with people he disagrees with often makes him the subject of fierce criticism about whom he “associates” with. He lucidly explains why the adoption of the idea that he shares responsibility for the views of others is so detrimental: “My policy is to speak with pretty much anyone—Islamists, Christian theocrats, Trumpists, Salafis—as long as I can say what I think on something that’s important to me.” </p><p>Even for Hamid, there are some red lines: He will not appear alongside white supremacists or those representing designated terror groups. But he insists that it is important to draw those lines as widely as possible: “If we said we couldn’t do research or couldn’t interview people who had bad views—how would we study things?” Hamid asked me. “It’s a very limited way of looking at the world, one that’s dangerous for democracy.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hamid is right. If we accept the logic of contamination by association, this requirement will quickly come to suppress the exchange of ideas—or even exposure to ideas which we need to interrogate precisely because we hate them. Tackling views we disagree with is a basic obligation of journalism, especially when they are held by people with the power to put them into effect.</p><p>David Remnick, the editor of the<em> New Yorker</em>, gave eloquent voice to the necessity of such interrogation when he explained why he wanted to interview former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon at the <em>New Yorker</em> festival in 2018. Remnick acknowledged the point of view of those who assert that it is better not to give a platform to someone with illiberal views. “But to interview Bannon is not to endorse him,” Remnick wrote. “The point of an interview, a rigorous interview, particularly in a case like this, is to put pressure on the views of the person being questioned.” </p><p>But Remnick was not able to put this pressure on Bannon because the pressure on Remnick to rescind Bannon’s invitation was so great that he canceled the interview. </p><p>To accept the principles of contamination by association would also have another, perhaps even more serious cost: It would make it much more difficult to build a community across ideological divides—or within one’s own ideological group. Today, people are held to account for everything they have said or written, no matter how long ago, and no matter how much their minds may have changed. But under the rules of contamination, any affiliation with anyone else means everything <em>they </em>have said and done is your responsibility, too. Under such circumstances, any rational person is going to think of everyone else, first and foremost, as a potential human landmine; better, then, to draw the circle of one’s friends, colleagues, and collaborators as narrowly as possible.</p><p><strong>Intent Is Irrelevant</strong></p><p>Last month, Libby Schaaf, the white mayor of Oakland, California, announced that ropes had been found hanging from trees around a local lake. “These incidents will be investigated as a hate crime,” she said at a press conference. “I want to be clear, regardless of the intentions of whoever put those nooses in our public trees, in our sacred public space here in Oakland, intentions don’t matter.”</p><p>An investigation revealed that the five ropes had nothing to do with lynching: They were homemade exercise equipment, used by adults and children, put up months earlier by a black resident, Victor Sengbe. He explained his intent at a press conference: “It was really a fun addition to the park.” </p><p>But this happy conclusion was of no interest to Schaaf. The actual purpose of the ropes did not “remove nor excuse their …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron" id="" title="">GitHub repo</a>) is a note-taking tool based on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011401.html" id="" title="">Zettelkasten</a>, that aims to be <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html" id="" title="">future-proof</a>. Version <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/releases/tag/0.6.0.0" id="" title="">0.6</a> just got released; its major highlight is that neuron is now based on the <strong>Pandoc</strong> AST. This allows us to support any format supported by <a href="https://pandoc.org/" id="" title="">Pandoc</a>. Experimental <strong>org-mode</strong> support is <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/313" id="" title="">already in</a>, to begin with.</p><h2 id="better-markdown">Better Markdown</h2><p>Previous versions of neuron used the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mmark" id="" title="">mmark</a> parser which advertises itself as being “strict”. This prevented certain links from working as they caused the parser to fail. In version 0.6, I switched over to use <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs" id="" title="">commonmark-hs</a>, which is the Haskell implementation of the <a href="https://commonmark.org/" id="" title=""><strong>CommonMark</strong> specification</a>, written by the same author of Pandoc. Another reason for switching is that commonmark-hs and its extensions can be compiled to JavaScript via GHCJS<sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, which is useful when reusing the Haskell code with the web app (see below).</p><p>The commonmark-hs parser includes <a href="https://github.com/jgm/commonmark-hs/tree/master/commonmark-extensions" id="" title="">a bunch of nifty <strong>extensions</strong></a> that are all made available in neuron.</p><p>In addition, you can style your Markdown notes using supported Semantic UI classes (<a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/176" id="" title="">see here</a>), as well as use raw HTML if necessary.</p><h2 id="uplink-tree">Uplink Tree</h2><p>I find arbitrary graph views of Zettelkasten software to be rarely useful. Neuron on the other hand displays what is known as a “<a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/5e41fd32.html" id="" title="">uplink tree</a>” in each note view, which represents the <em>subset</em> (inasmuch as “uplink” is a type of “backlink”) of the backlink graph for that note. In Zettelkasten-speak, we talk of a note “branching” to another. The uplink tree displays all notes “branching” to the note being viewed.</p><p>Uplink Trees are similar to navigation panel or category tree, except that the heterarchy is built organically over time based on how the notes are linked (see <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2017401.html" id="" title="">Folgezettel Heterarchy</a>). In the screenshot below, you are viewing the uplink tree of the note titled “<span><span data-inverted="" data-position="right center" data-tooltip="Tags: nix; reflex/obelisk"><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017101.html">Type safe static assets</a></span></span>”. Notice how this note has multiple parents (that “branch of” to that note). See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/2011504.html" id="" title="">Linking</a> in the neuron manual.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/uplinktree.png" title=""></p><h2 id="vim">Vim</h2><p>In addition to <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/4a6b25f1.html" id="" title="">Emacs</a>, there is now a Vim extension for neuron. See <a href="https://github.com/ihsanturk/neuron.vim" id="" title="">neuron.vim</a> by ihsan. Just like the Emacs extension, it supports “virtual titles” in neovim, where the title of a linked note is displayed next to the link ID, as you can see from the screenshot below.</p><p><img id="" src="https://www.srid.ca/static/neuronvim.png" title=""></p><h2 id="improved-cli-query">Improved CLI query</h2><p>The <code id="">neuron query</code> command can be used to query your Zettelkasten and get JSON output. <code id="">neuron query --id &lt;ID&gt;</code> gets you the metadata of a zettel note, whereas <code id="">neuron query --graph</code> gets the entire graph. For an example of what you can do with the later, check out <a href="https://github.com/b0o/neuron-extras" id="" title="">neuron-autoindex</a> by Maddison Hellstrom.</p><h2 id="error-reporting">Error reporting</h2><p>Neuron 0.6 includes resilient error handling. If there is an error in your notes, the command line tool will report them both in the console and the web interface, without breaking its workflow. This enables you to leave the daemon (<code id="">neuron rib -ws ..</code>) running on your server, as all errors are now reported on the generated site.</p><h2 id="docker-images">Docker images</h2><p>While Nix is still the recommended way to install, we now also have auto-created Docker images for neuron. With one <code id="">docker run ...</code> command, you can run the latest development version of <code id="">neuron</code> in a matter of seconds. The whole image is only about 100MB in size. See <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/c6176636.html" id="" title="">Docker workflow</a> for details.</p><h2 id="automatic-publishing">Automatic Publishing</h2><p>You can now set up your neuron notes to publish <em>automatically</em> on the web for free. See <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron-template#readme" id="" title="">neuron-template</a> to get started. The gist of the idea is that we use GitHub Actions and Pages to update your published site as you change your notes in the Git repository. I publish every neuron site in this way. A <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/778816d3.html" id="" title="">GitLab workflow</a> also exists.</p><p>You can also of course alternatively choose to self-host your neuron site, say as a systemd service. See the <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6479cd5e.html" id="" title="">documentation on this</a>.</p><h2 id="web--mobile-app">Web &amp; mobile app</h2><p><a href="http://www.cerveau.app/" id="" title="">Cerveau</a> (in private beta) is the web application on top of neuron that integrates with GitHub. The idea is that you can have your cake and eat it too. A command-line based workflow to edit your notes in Git repo does not mean you can’t do the same in a web application or a mobile app. Cerveau aims to address this gap, with the motto being: future-proof notes with little to no compromise on delightful user experience.</p></div></div>]]>

July 28, 2020 | https://presumably.de/on-the-effectiveness-of-fixmes.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://presumably.de/on-the-effectiveness-of-fixmes.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");
}</code></pre>
<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

    <p>This 100 page document has recently made the rounds: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zao_AyBhNb8TPWrQqgXn5NzNAgfEqzTIaFYos7wdqGI/edit#"><em>Thiel on Progress and Stagnation</em></a>. Despite looking quite comprehensive, I was surprised to see that quite a few of Thiel’s online writings were absent from the references section. Maybe the creators of the document left those out on purpose, but I suspect they might just not have been aware of them. A lot of Thiel’s online writings appear in relatively obscure places, and I haven’t been able to find a good list that includes all of them. So here is a list of everything Peter Thiel has <em>written online</em>, as far as I’m aware of:</p>

        <p>Pushing the limits of mobility and performance has become easier now that the iPad Pro has the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXQT2LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-2nd-generation-us-english">Magic Keyboard</a> and Visual Studio Code can be web-based as <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: It’s pretty nice but has some shortcomings. This article covers both the workflow and <a href="https://gitlab.com/mterhar/code-server-buildtools">configuration</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-workflow">Summary of the workflow</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wake iPad, attach keyboard</li>
<li>Open your code-server url</li>
<li>Checkout repo (or resume existing)</li>
<li>Preview markdown, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">code spell checker</a></li>
<li><code>Cmd+shift+C</code> to open a console and run build, test, etc</li>
<li>Commit updates, get immediate pipeline feedback from <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow">GitLab plugin</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="not-for-everyone">Not for everyone</h2>
<p>Depending on the types of software being developed, the deficiencies in this workflow may overwhelm the benefits.  I talk about some of the problems with the workflow later on. If you want to be talked out of it, <a href="#problems">check that out first</a>. Otherwise, read on for all the neat outcomes and surprises.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<li>Drawings and illustrations</li>
<li>Cloudy and containerized work</li>

<p>For the following barrage of screenshots, they are from when I was working on <a href="https://brownfield.dev/post/2020-07-05-introducing-lab-assistant/">Lab Assistant</a> from my iPad. It seemed like a good place to start recording some of the ease and struggles.</p>

<p>When starting on a new project or picking up work on this device for the first time, from that home location pull up a terminal (<code>Cmd+Shift+C</code>) and run <code>git clone</code>. This will create the new directory and fill it up with code.  If it’s a microservice situation, create a directory and clone all the various repos into that.</p>

<p>Sadly, uploading images directly to GitLab is one-at-a-time so squashing commits is much more important.  It’s also hard to format images for the web.</p>
<h3 id="switching-gears-to-blog-post">Switching gears to blog post</h3>
<p>The go workflow is pretty slick. Not a lot of stuff missing with the basics.  I’m also trying to use this workflow for making the blog post you’re reading right now.  Drafting the text is nice and easy. The spell checker plugin makes it better than my standard <code>Sublime -&gt; MS Word</code> workflow.</p>
<p>The biggest deficiency is image formatting and organization.  The iPad is great for making diagrams but once the images are saved, getting them into a web-optimized format and loaded into the repository is a hassle. Especially because you can only upload one file at a time to GitLab’s “upload file” interface. I did realize the WebIDE can do multiple uploads, but only too late.</p>
<p>Once the files are in the repo, they’re gigantic PNG files which should be shrunk, cropped, and optimized for web display. I need to find some tool to plug this gap in my creative work.</p>

<p>After uploading the images, renaming them and adding references, it’s time to take a look at what was built.</p>

<p>Every change to the code is detected and the site is rebuilt. Since code-server saves the files every time you stop typing, it leads to a lot of rebuilds. The good news is that they take a dozen milliseconds each.</p>

<p>This review app URL in my configuration is tied to a DNS and internal IP address so it’s only accessible to me and others within my network or on a VPN. If you’re working on something public, exposing and sharing the review app may help with reviews and collaboration. It’s probably easier to just use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/">GitLab’s review apps</a> in that case though.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that using an 11-inch iPad Pro with the magic keyboard is a nice way to work comfortably anywhere. Even if the work is relatively intensive coding or authoring.</p>

<p>I will continue to use this workflow for a month or two and update about what enhancements come up or if I abandon it eventually.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is about how I arrived at this setup, what it took to get it configured, and how I plan on managing it.</p>
<h2 id="how-things-were">How things were</h2>
<p>For the past few years, I’ve been trying to find a lightweight way to get all the benefits of cloud and remote computing while having a comfortable and minimal developer experience. Small devices that were attempted in the past had too many compromises related to performance and feedback.</p>
<p>The prior evaluations have been erratic because it’s tough to tell which combination of physical devices and services can yield a favorable result. Here are some of the things I’ve tried that didn’t pan out.</p>
<p>All of the below are working from an iPad using various Apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>MacBook 11 inch air:  Screen was very low resolution, performance lacking</li>
<li>MacBook 12 inch:  At the time, I had a requirement for windows development and the devices (even i7) couldn’t seem to keep up with visual studio in debug mode plus a database</li>
<li>iPad GitLab’s built-in WebIDE: lack of terminals and listing and compilers, feedback loop through pipelines is too slow</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Working Copy</strong> for git repos: great repo management and multi-file workflow, same lack of terminals and pipeline-based feedback</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Screens</strong> with full MacOS on the tiny screen: native workflow so pretty good but exceptionally expensive and clipboard troubles make it frustrating</li>
<li>iPad app <strong>Prompt</strong> to use a Linux shell to do things: good for administrative but session time-outs and multi-file editing is poor experience</li>
</ol>
<p>I was recently convinced to try Visual Studio Code and noticed that it has a code-server hosted web editor option. <strong>Evaluation time!</strong></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-code-server">Setting up code-server</h2>
<p>The Visual Studio Code installation is a regular software installer on MacOS. Just install it. Super easy.</p>
<p>The code-server installation has some options like a simple web server that runs on the same Mac system. I consider this to be a copy of the <code>Screens</code> workflow so I’m not going to try this.</p>
<p>There is a code-server installation option that is to run as a container. This piqued my interest since containers are neat and flexible. This can be combined with the GitLab CI pipeline to build replacement custom containers to increase the built-in capabilities.  Linuxserver.io offers this with a templating/overlay mechanism to make some of the same enhancements I have done.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-kubernetes">Why not Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>In the interest of doing everything the hardest way imaginable, I took the code-server docker container and spun it up in my local Kubernetes cluster so I could benefit from the infrastructure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ingress to a friendly domain name</li>
<li>Certificates issued from Lets Encrypt</li>
<li>Resilience and fail-over</li>
<li>Ephemeral filesystem as a scratchpad</li>
<li>Persistent storage for home directory</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ingress">Ingress</h3>
<p>The main ingress configuration to access <code>code.p.terharlab.com</code> is set to connect to the code-server service.</p>
<p>I also added a Kubernetes service for 1313 and an Ingress mapping my internal load balancer to that service. Now I can pull up <code>hugo server --bind=0.0.0.0 --appendPort=false --baseURL={hugo ingress}</code> And it will attach to a service. I attached this Hugo port to an internal ingress rather than the public one to keep it walled off from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="resilience-and-fail-over">Resilience and fail-over</h3>
<p>Since the storage is external to the pod, if the pod moves around, the storage will be re-attached. The kubelet scheduler will make sure a code-server keeps running and if it moves from one node to another, the ingress and services will reconfigure to get traffic to the right place.</p>
<h3 id="ephemeral-filesystem">Ephemeral filesystem</h3>
<p>When running the container, if you want to add something like golang or a different version of python, it’s easy enough. Just run <code>apt-get</code> or download binaries and put them in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. If there is a problem with the tool, just restart the pod and it’ll go away since <code>/usr</code> and <code>/etc</code> are ephemeral.</p>
<p>I followed the enhancement process below to add <code>go</code>, <code>hugo</code>, <code>kubectl</code>, and <code>helm</code> to the image so I can build my lab-assistant application and post to my blog. This just requires updating the <code>Dockerfile</code> and restarting the pod to get the new container.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h3>
<p>To be sure that the day-to-day configuration updates don’t get lost in the ether when the container restarts, the entire <code>/home/coder</code> directory is in the persistent volume. In my environment, this creates an iscsi volume and attaches it to the container to preserve:</p>
<ul>
<li>dotfiles</li>
<li>repositories</li>
<li>go (packages)</li>
<li><code>/home/coder/.local/share/code-server</code>
<ul>
<li>extensions</li>
<li>logs</li>
<li>config files</li>
<li>spell checker library</li>
</ul>
</li>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I have started to be more conscious about privacy over the Internet, and one of the most important aspects to take care of when talking about privacy and security is where to store your passwords, as important as what passwords you use.</p>

<p>Most people (including me until some weeks ago) use the same password everywhere to easily remember it later.</p>

<p>Another common practice is to use iOS, Google or Firefox password tools, the problem with that is that you are forced into their ecosystem, and one should always think about who <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/your-passwords-online.html">let in charge of your keys</a></p>



<p>It is impossible to keep a lot of passwords in our memory, and writing them down is not a good idea either. I started to keep them in a text file encrypted with a password, but it was not the best solution.</p>

<p>So I started to use Chrome password manager, but I  did not want to install it on the iPad, even on the PC, I started using Firefox on the laptop too.</p>

<p>So I started to look for an independent password manager tool, but almost all of them required a paid account. And I wanted to have full control over my passwords. So, I decided to use Bitwarden, because there is a self-hosted option</p>

<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>

<p>Bitwarden is an Open Source password manager tool, you can host in your server with Docker, this is maybe the most secure way to manage your passwords because you are in full control of them. Of course, they are on a server open to the Internet so they will never be completely secure.</p>

<h3 id="main-features">Main features</h3>

<h4 id="different-type-of-containers">Different type of containers</h4>

<p>Bitwarden is not only useful to manage your passwords, but it can also be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Login Passwords</strong>: As all main tools, it records the url, the username, and password.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit Cards</strong>: Credit cards can also be stored on Bitwarden server</li>
  <li><strong>Identity</strong>: You can store all data of your identity, like Passport number, Social Security number, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Note</strong>: This feature I use a lot, they are like post-it, but secure post-it, I mainly use them to store the keys to unlock sites when 2FA fail, I keep the scratch codes in there.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="password-generator">Password Generator</h4>

<p>Of course, you can generate the password with the tool, and adjust the type of password you want.</p>

<p>You can generate passwords of different sizes, from 5 to 128 characters, and if the password will contain: Upper case, lower case, numbers, and special characters. You can also set the minimum quantity of numbers and special characters.</p>

<h4 id="export-and-import">Export and Import</h4>

<p>You can export and import the data, this must be done carefully, because it is exported a plain text document, and that document should be deleted once it is not needed anymore.</p>

<h4 id="reports">Reports</h4>

<p>Bitwarden offers different reports that help you a lot to keep your credentials secure</p>

<h5 id="exposed-password-report">Exposed Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one of the best features it has, it shows you all the passwords you use that has been exposed on the web because someplace you used them has been hacked.</p>

<p>Be sure the change all passwords that appear on this report.</p>

<h5 id="reused-password-report">Reused Password Report</h5>

<p>This is one is pretty self-explanatory, this report shows all sites where you have used the same password, try to change all of them to random passwords, if one site is compromised the hackers will not gain access to other sites where you use the same login and password.</p>

<h5 id="weak-password-report">Weak Password Report</h5>

<p>Here you can review all accounts that have weak passwords, usually the same where you have reused passwords. Keep all passwords randomly generated, and with long strings, no less than 14 characters.</p>

<h5 id="unsecured-sites-report">Unsecured Sites Report</h5>

<p>Here you will have listed all sites where you have an account that does not use SSL, in other words, the signing url is http and not https, on this sites you should of course use unique passwords, as it is easier to lose that password, and the hacker should not be able to use it in any other site.</p>

<h5 id="inactive-two-factor-authentication">Inactive two-factor authentication</h5>

<p>In this report, it will be listed all sites where 2FA is available, but you do not have it enabled, be sure to use 2FA on every site that has available. This way even if your password gets compromised, nobody will be able to access your info on that site.</p>

<h5 id="data-breach-report">Data Breach Report</h5>

<p>You can check here if your user name or email has been compromised in any data breach.</p>

<p>The report will show you what info has been made public together with your email address or login, the only thing you can do, is to change the passwords you used on those sites.</p>

<h4 id="two-step-login">Two-Step Login</h4>

<p>Your Bitwarden account can also be secured by enabling 2FA, you have these options to set it up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authenticator APP: Like the ones from Google, Microsoft or Authy.</li>
  <li>Yubico: You need to buy a hardware YubiKey to use this method.</li>
  <li>Duo.com: You need an account with them</li>
  <li>Fido:  This one is also from Yubico</li>
  <li>Email: You will get an email with the code every time you want to login</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="self-hosted-options">Self Hosted Options</h3>

<h4 id="official-apps">Official Apps</h4>

<p>You have good documentation on the site to host it on your server with Docker:</p>

<p>You will need to install at least <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/server">the server</a> which you can use with your browser extension and your mobile app.</p>

<p>But there is another option for your personal use.</p>

<h4 id="bitwardenrs">Bitwarden_rs</h4>

<p>This one is the option for  persona use, it is small and also have all features the official one.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs">installation instructions here</a></p>

<p>But, here I will let you how I installed on my server.</p>

<pre><code>version: '3.3'
services:
  server:
    restart: always
    container_name: bitwarden
    volumes:
      - 'bw-data:/data/'
    ports:
      - '8888:80'
    image: 'bitwardenrs/server:latest'
    labels:
      - "docker-volume-backup.stop-during-backup=true"
  backup:
    image: futurice/docker-volume-backup:2.0.0
    environment:
      AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: XXXXXXX      # S3 bucket which you own, and already exists
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: YYYYYYYYYYY # Read AWS secrets from environment (or a .env file)
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # Allow use of the "stop-during-backup" feature
      - bw-data:/backup/bitwareden-backup:ro

volumes:
  bw-data:
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration, you will have two containers, one with Bitwarden, and the second one that will take care to back up your database to AWS S3 or any compatible option. Remember that your vault is encrypted.</p>

<p>You will now only need Nginx or Caddy in front of it, I am using Caddy 2, with this configuration:</p>

<pre><code>bw.mysite.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8888
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use Nginx, you will need something like this:</p>

<pre><code> location /{
  proxy_pass https://your_local_host:8888;
  proxy_redirect off;
  proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Url-Scheme $scheme;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Among with other server configurations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Consider using a Password Manager tool, I recommend you Bitwarden, but you can use anyone you trust, I know that NextCloud comes with an add-on for it too, I think that is also a great option, what you should not do, is to re-use passwords, or use weak passwords.</p>

<p>Security on the Internet is as important as security in the real world, and you do not let your home or car keys anywhere, you keep them secure and with you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C source code below is the common code that is required by any of the code samples that are generated above. &nbsp;Simply copy and paste the following code into a file called 'main.c' along with the dynamically generated code above in order to make a hard-coded program that will perform your intended regex search. &nbsp;Make sure the code below is passed before the dynamically generated code above. &nbsp;You can compile the code using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>gcc main.c
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code should compile without any issues and produce the executable program 'a.out'. &nbsp;You can run this program with this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>./a.out

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, you'll find an interactive visualization that you can use to simulate regular expressions. &nbsp;You can type any regular expression and the tool will automatically create two diagrams that correspond to your regular expression. &nbsp;Both of these diagrams are interactive, zoomable and include support for a fullscreen mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first diagram is a parse tree. &nbsp;Constructing a parse tree is the first step that a regular expression engine will perform in order to decide what meaning each character will have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can click on individual nodes in the parse tree to highlight the corresponding character in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can also go the other way and click on individual characters in the regular expression to quickly find the corresponding characters in the parse tree. &nbsp;By reviewing how the characters are grouped together in the parse tree, you can gain insights about the meanings of individual characters and how they relate to each other in the regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second diagram shows a control flow graph corresponding to your regular expression. &nbsp;This control flow graph illustrates the step by step process that is undertaken whenever your regex is matched against a piece of text. &nbsp; When attempting to match your regular expression, the process starts at the 'BEGIN' node and ends at either the 'MATCH' or 'FAILURE' node. &nbsp;Any path from the 'BEGIN' node to the 'MATCH' node corresponds to a piece of text that matches your regular expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nodes in the control flow graph correspond directly to one or more characters in your regular expression. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see the corresponding nodes highlighted in your original regular expression and the parse tree. &nbsp;Also note that clicking on characters in your regex will also highlight any associated nodes in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult to truly understand how your regular expression works without seeing the decisions it makes when attempting to match a given piece of text. &nbsp;For this reason, every time you make changes to your regular expression, this visualization tool will automatically generate a piece of text that contains at least one match to your regular expression. &nbsp;If you want to review how the matching process work with your own customized piece of text, simply change the input value for the search string and the animation will update automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of matching the regular expression starts at the 'BEGIN' node and continues by following the arrows to arrive at the nodes that actually do the work of the regular expression itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of writing this sentence, all regular expressions that this visualizer tool supports are ultimately transformed into an control flow graph that consists of the following 5 types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) &nbsp;<strong>CHAR</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a specific character at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;If the character matches, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>2) &nbsp;<strong>CLASS</strong>&nbsp;This node type checks for a class of characters at the current position in the text that is being searched. &nbsp;This node type effectively does the same thing as the first node type, except it allows for more than one possible character at the current position in the search text. &nbsp;If the current character in the text is among the list of acceptable characters specified by this node, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't match, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>3) &nbsp;<strong>SPLIT</strong>&nbsp;This node type performs a 'split' operation. &nbsp;This is a situation where the regular expression matcher has a more than one possible path to continue through the control flow graph. &nbsp;In programming terms, this node effectively does the same thing as forking a process or splitting off work into two separate threads. &nbsp;This can also be implemented in a single thread by trying both paths one at time and pushing saved information onto a stack. &nbsp;In computer science theory, this node type should remind you of the difference between DFAs and NFAs.</li>
<li>4) &nbsp;<strong>ANCHOR</strong>&nbsp;This node type represents the commonly used 'beginning of string' or 'end of string' regular expression characters. &nbsp;This node is type is quite simple, as it simply checks whether the current position in the string is, respectively, at the first position, or the last position. &nbsp;If the check succeeds, we continue to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If it doesn't, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
<li>5) &nbsp;<strong>PROGRESS</strong>&nbsp;This node type is necessary to avoid infinite loops in certain regular expressions that can include repetitions of possibly zero length strings. &nbsp;Without this node, there are cases where the control flow graph could potentially contain cycles that cause us to move around forever without making any progress. &nbsp;Each time a progress node is visited, it makes sure that we've made some progress in matching the regex since the last visit. &nbsp;If we have made progress, we move to the next node in the control flow graph. &nbsp;If not, the control flow graph moves to the 'FAILURE' 'node'.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may find it surprising, but most commonly used regular expressions can be described in terms of the above 5 simple node types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of this visualization tool is help you understand the precise meaning of the characters in a regular expression. &nbsp;Therefore, this the tool will also cross-compile your regular expression into a hard-coded C program that implements a search for the regex pattern that you specified. &nbsp;Each of the nodes in the control flow graph has a direct correspondence to several lines of C source code that are expressed below the two diagrams. &nbsp;You can click on nodes in the control flow graph to see which lines of code correspond to the node that you've selected.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_this_character(current_character, CHARACTER_TO_MATCH)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the implementation of a 'CHAR' node, we first use the 'safely_get_character' function to pick out the next character from the string being searched. &nbsp;The implementation of the 'safely_get_character' function is listed above in the 'Common C Code' section. &nbsp;This function is very simple since it just checks to make sure we're still within the bounds of the string that's being search, and if so, it returns character at the current position. &nbsp;If we're past the end of the string, we just directly exit the process. &nbsp;This corresponds to moving to the 'failure' node in the control flow graph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we've obtained the current character, we check to make sure that it matches the literal character that was specified in the regular expression using the 'matches_this_character' function. &nbsp;Here is the implementation of the matches_this_character function. &nbsp;As you can see, this function is very simple since it just checks to make sure that the current character in the string being searched is the same as the literal character that was supplied in the regex.</p>



<p><code><pre>current_character = safely_get_character(str, offset, pos, str_len);
<span>if</span>(matches_one_of_these_characters(current_character, NUM_CHARACTERS, CHARACTER_1, CHARACTER_2, CHARACTER_3, ..., CHARACTER_N)){
  pos++;
}<span>else</span>{
  exit(<span>1</span>);
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 'CLASS' node …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started at Facebook back in 2012, it was developed internally before being released as open-source in 2015. In 2018 the project was moved to the newly created GraphQL Foundation, hosted by the Linux foundation. GraphQL creator Lee Byron has stated his aim is to make it ubiquitous across web platforms. Let’s look at how plausible that perspective is.</p>
<h2>A bit of theory</h2>
<p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. Developers create a schema that contains all the data clients can query through the service. This schema contains object types that determine the object you can request and the types it has. The schema is the basis all queries get checked against and then, after being validated, executed. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h2>A bit of practice</h2>
<p>Let’s check out how it actually works by looking at a simple example like a forum, blog or social media. In our example let’s say users have four properties: username, email, location and ID and can create posts with titles. Now if you need to create a profile component that only shows the username and ID, you don’t need the user’s email and location. With REST and other web service architectures, the API returns all user data and there’s no way to request specifically what you need without fetching unnecessary data. Doesn’t sound like a big problem? Just look at Facebook accounts and how many variables they have and you’ll easily get why they started developing GraphQL.</p>

<p>GraphQL allows you to request exactly the parameters you want and the API responds with only the data you requested. It also does this via a single endpoint that handles all the client’s requests. That was just a basic query. One of the advantages of GraphQL is the ability to nest queries so it can be expanded to fetch a number of variables. </p>

<p>Let’s go back to the above-mentioned example of a blog/forum/social media API. What if your profile component needs to be a bit more complex? We’ll make a query that requests some basic user info as well as post titles for that particular user so that the profile provides a glimpse of the user’s activity as well as basic information.</p>
<h2>Why development teams are adopting GraphQL?</h2>
<p>One of the surveys directed to a variety of companies having experience with GraphQL asked their CTOs and lead developers why they decided to pivot to GraphQL. The survey identified six main benefits (<em>Development Velocity, Modularity, Scalability, Performance, Reliability, Security</em>) and asked responders how strongly they would agree/disagree with the following statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We were able to speed up our development using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>We were able to scale our projects faster with GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>It was easier to unify our APIs (e.g., Microservices, legacy endpoints, third-party services, etc.)</em></li>
<li><em>There has been an increase in performance using GraphQL</em></li>
<li><em>Our architecture is more stable, with decreased downtime, and fewer errors</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The results are:</p>

<p>The interpretation of the survey’s results was summed up closed in the table below. The most important thought is that GraphQL managed to provide what teams were looking for that small to medium as well as large enterprise teams. </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team size</th>
<th>What they wanted to achieve</th>
<th>What they’ve achived</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>50-100 &amp; 100+ devs</td>
<td>Faster development speed, better scalability, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10-50 devs</td>
<td>Better modularity, higher performance</td>
<td>Faster development, better infrastructure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>up to 10 devs</td>
<td>Faster development, better modularity</td>
<td>Faster development, better scalability</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2>Simple and flexible</h2>
<p>GraphQL not only straightforward, but it’s also extremely adaptable. GraphQL is client-driven and it’s creators emphasize they were focused on the needs of the client, not the server. That’s also why graphQL is so flexible so that it’s as easy as possible to use for clients.  You can use GraphQL with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python,</li>
<li>React </li>
<li>Java,</li>
<li>C++, </li>
<li>PHP, </li>
</ul>
<p>and a number of others as it’s meant to be a one size fits all solution that retrieves data regardless of the service, platform, or coding language. Can it become widely used across all platforms? Time will tell, but it certainly has all the tools for that.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>After starting to use <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2019/12/30/cracking-the-human-memory/">spaced repetition more actively</a> and being <a href="https://rolisz.ro/2020/05/24/bullet-journaling/">more consistent with my journaling</a>, now I've tackled improving my note taking skills.</p><p>Over the last couple of months, I've read about various note-taking methods, different approaches and diverse goals for them and they helped me change my perspective on collecting ideas.</p><h2 id="my-previous-approaches-to-taking-notes">My previous approaches to taking notes</h2><p>While I was still in school, I didn't take too good notes. I guess the Romanian educational system is not set up to encourage that kind of critical thinking which leads to taking good notes. In most classes, the teacher would dictate a lesson, I would write that down and then memorize it, without needing to create my own summarized version of the lesson.</p><p>Then I took notes in Google Keep. When it came out, I was impressed by how simple and snappy it was, compared to Evernote for example. I've used it for around 6 years, so I have a lot of notes jotted down there. But Keep doesn't offer good ways to organize notes, having only tags and search. But to search, you have to remember something to look for, so it's almost impossible to find notes which you have forgotten.</p><p>As I've started moving my notes from Keep to Obsidian, I found a lot of old notes which I had totally forgotten about. Some of those notes were ideas I had, but I never followed up on them. Looking back they were good ideas: I know because in the meantime other people have implemented them.</p><h2 id="goals-of-a-note-taking-system">Goals of a note taking system</h2><p>A goal of a note taking system should be to store information, so that your brain can do more fun/useful stuff.</p><p>But another goal is to help you connect ideas, even from different domains. As you read things in books, blogs, or come up with ideas on your own, eventually some of them will be related and can be combined to make something even better. The note taking system should facilitate creating these connections.</p><p>It should also help you process your notes. A note is not a static thing. It's not something you just write down and then never touch again. Almost all ideas will eventually need refining. When you read a book and find something noteworthy, you write some notes, but in time you find that you can reword it better, as you understand things better. For your own ideas, in time you add something; you cut some things, hopefully making them better and then you create something with them.</p><p>Lastly, the note organizing system should help you organize and browse your notes. It should encourage serendipitous rediscovery of forgotten notes. It should help visualize them. It should make it easy to see all notes that are related to a certain note or to a certain topic.</p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-5.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-5.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-5.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Meta: Writing this post in Obsidian. Left: folder pane; middle: raw markdown; right: Rendered note</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a new desktop app for creating a "A second brain, for you, forever.". It's quite new, it was released publicly two months ago and it's not even at version 1.0, but development is progressing quite quickly, with a new version coming out almost weekly.</p><p>Obsidian is built around Markdown files, which means that the notes are portable and won't get stuck in an old program, should the company go out of business. It enhances the Markdown syntax with the some shortcuts for creating connections between pages using <code>[[name of other page]]</code> syntax. You can see for each page what other pages link back to it. There's also a way to embed one file (or part of a file) into another one. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-6.png 600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-6.png 1000w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-6.png 1600w, https://rolisz.ro/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-6.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The graph view</figcaption></figure><p>One cool looking feature in Obsidian is the graph view, where you can visualize how your notes are connected. This leads to some interesting looking "constellations". </p><p>There are also plugins available. For now, the API is internal, so all the plugins are made by the same company, but they say that once they reach 1.0, they will make the API public. </p><p>Because Obsidian is based on Markdown files, you can store them wherever you want and you can sync them across devices with your favorite syncing tool. So far, I've used GitHub. </p><p>One disadvantage is that it doesn't have a mobile app so far (or a remote interface in general). On one hand, it's not a big issue for me, because my goals for notes require a big screen and a nice keyboard. In practice, I still like to have access to my notes even on the go, so I just use an Android Git client with a Markdown editor. Maybe one day I'll change this to expose my notes as a static website. </p><h2 id="my-note-taking-workflow">My note taking workflow</h2><p>My workflow is inspired by (but only inspired, not fully copied from) the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125?gi=635ef2e210e3">Zettelkasten</a> method of Niklas Luhman, which is the trending note taking framework du jour, sprinkled with ideas from <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/basb">Tiago Forte</a> and others. When my note-taking workflow grows up, it wants to be like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. </p><p>I have a loose categorization of my notes into folders. I'm not very strict about them and I don't want to spend much time organizing a hierarchy. Some notes also have tags (simply words prefixed with # and Obsidian is smart enough to start a search for them if you click on one). </p><p>Many of my notes don't start their life in Obsidian, but in my bullet journal. When I hear something new, or I read something interesting, often my bullet journal is closer to me, so I jot down the main ideas there. Then, when I get to my computer and I have time I copy it into Obsidian and I flesh out the ideas fully. Then I try to find any other notes that are relevant and add connections to them. </p><p>One thing that I try to do is to make my notes my own. This means that if I read an interesting article, I don't just copy paste the interesting parts, but I actually reword them and write them down as I understood them. This helps both comprehension and retention. </p><p>For certain topics, I create index maps, where I list all the notes that I have related to that topic. So notes belong to multiple index maps, because they are relevant in different areas. </p><p>As I add new notes and create connections between them, I end up revisiting old notes and updating them. Sometimes it's with a negative update (it didn't pan out, it was a wrong idea), but sometimes it's a positive one (a further development or something similar someone else has done). </p><p>The most interesting part is when notes from very different areas start to "touch" each other. Because of the graph view, it's easy to see how close notes are to each other. I also use the graph view to see what notes are isolated and then I try to find them a place. As you can see in the above screenshot, I still have a lot of work to do. </p><p>So far I have added 160 notes in Obsidian, so it's a small knowledge base. I still have many notes in Google Keep to move over. But I feel like Obsidian has already helped me (I feel on top of my notes) and I hope something nice (and useful) will come out of it. </p><p>Top photo by <a href="https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#/media/Bild:Obszidi%C3%A1n(Vezuv)005.jpg">Pogány Péter - Egen Wark</a>.</p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 31.</em></p>

<p>In this process, cash flows through a number of systems described in detail below.</p>
<p>Accountants perform cash reconciliations to ensure that cash has appropriately gone through these systems for each transaction.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the completeness of a sale or transaction across the company’s financial systems. Its completion provides assurance for both cash and revenue balances.</p>
<p>Multiple financial systems are involved in a cash reconciliation and generally, cash balances across these systems do not match.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/cash-reconciliation-example.png" alt="cash-reconciliation-example"></p>
<p>We’ll explore cash reconciliations further below, but first we’d like to address a common misconception.</p>
<h5 id="cashreconciliationvsbankreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation vs. Bank Reconciliation</h5>
<p>Cash reconciliations are often misunderstood to be the same thing as bank reconciliations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation">bank reconciliation</a> is the process of matching transaction amounts reported in a bank statement with those recorded in the general ledger. Its purpose is to ensure that the cash balance recorded in the general ledger aligns with the entity’s actual cash balance in the company’s bank account. While companies and banks record the same transactions, the time at which a company records cash in the general ledger often differs from the time at which their bank reports the associated change.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="systemsinvolvedinacashreconciliation">Systems Involved in a Cash Reconciliation</h2>
<p>A cash reconciliation is more complex and comprehensive than a bank reconciliation because it involves a company's entire financial technology stack. Below are the four most common systems involved in a cash reconciliation. They can vary depending on company size, business model, or technological maturity.</p>
<h5 id="billingsystem">Billing System:</h5>
<p>A billing system creates and manages customer invoices that allow customers to pay for their purchases. Cash from billing systems represent how much cash is expected to be collected from sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Aria, Chargebee, Recurly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="paymentprocessor">Payment Processor:</h5>
<p>A payment processor relays customers’ payment information to a company’s bank and the customers’ banks in order to complete a transaction. It verifies payment legitimacy and provides instructions to banks for fund transfers. Cash from payment processors represent the final cash received by the company’s bank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stripe, Adyen, Braintree/PayPal, WorldPay</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="companysbank">Company’s Bank:</h5>
<p>A company’s bank collects and deposits the cash from transactions that are successfully processed by payment processors. It is the final system involved in a cash reconciliation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="revenuerecognitionsystem">Revenue Recognition System:</h5>

<p>The simplest way to examine the relationship between cash, revenue, and deferred revenue is to understand the deferred revenue roll forward. A deferred revenue roll forward is a simple calculation that ensures incoming and outgoing activities to the deferred revenue balance are properly accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/deferred-revenue-rollforward-1.png" alt="deferred-revenue-rollforward-1"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First, let’s review deferred revenue itself.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue is a cash payment from a customer for goods or services to be provided in the future. Since the seller’s obligation has not been filled, the cash has not been earned, and the seller records this as a liability on the Balance Sheet via a deferred revenue balance. Deferred revenue is especially common among subscription and SaaS companies, in which payments are made upfront in exchange for service periods in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: On Jan 1, 2020 a customer makes a $120 purchase for a subscription service spanning Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Jan 1</td><td>Cash</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td></td><td>$120</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As the seller completes its obligations over time to earn the revenue, the deferred revenue balance on the Balance Sheet is reduced accordingly by the amount of revenue earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The seller recognizes revenue monthly based on the service period of Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. $120 across 12 months results in revenue of $10 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 28</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>March 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And so forth for April 30, May 31, etc...</p>
<p>At month 12 on Dec 31, 2020, the deferred revenue balance will be fully exhausted as the $120 cash payment would be fully recognized.</p>
<p>Check out our previous blog post on <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/revenue-cash-reconciliation-for-subscription-businesses/">Revenue Cash Accounting for Subscription Businesses</a> for more detailed journal entries.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="cashisimportanttodeferredrevenue">Cash is Important to Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Since cash is an important part of the deferred revenue calculation, cash balance figures must be accurate for deferred revenue to be reliable. Accounting teams can be confident in their revenue figures by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performing cash reconciliations to verify that cash activity in the period is accurate</li>
<li>Comparing the deferred revenue roll forward calculation and deferred revenue balance in the general ledger.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the beginning deferred revenue, cash, and ending deferred revenue balances have been substantiated, then there is reasonable assurance that revenue for the period is also correct.</p>
<p>It may seem simple in this example, but calculating deferred revenue can be quite complicated. Because revenue is derived from sales in both the current and prior periods, companies with high volume of transactions and/or multiple product lines may experience additional difficulty calculating deferred revenue.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>

<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>
<li>Fingerprint Reader</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>

<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service. Although, it should be noted this could cause your system to fail to boot, if the network daemons require internet connection (highly unadvised to use such systems on a …</p></div></article></div>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"> <h2>Intro</h2> <p>&nbsp; I want to examine together with you various types of sort algorithms and the tricks they use to lower the magic O number. I reach the conclusion that high performance algorithms that are labeled as specific to a certain type of data can be made generic or that the generic algorithms aren't really that generic either. I end up proposing a new form of function that can be fed to a sorting function in order to reach better performance than the classic O(n*log(n)). Extra bonus: finding distinct values in a list.</p> <h2>Sorting</h2> <p>&nbsp; But first, what is sorting? Given a list of items that can be compared to one another as lower or higher, return the list in the order from lowest to highest. Since an item can be any type of data record, to define a generic sorting algorithm we need to feed it the rules that make an item lower than another and that is called the comparison function. Let's try an example in Javascript:</p>  <pre><code>  // random function from start to end inclusive
  function rand(start, end) {
    return parseInt(start + Math.random() * (end - start + 1));
  }
  
  // measure time taken by an action and output it in console
  let perfKey = 0;
  function calcPerf(action) {
    const key = perfKey++;
    performance.mark('start_' + key);
    action();
    performance.mark('end_' + key);
    const measure = performance.measure('measure_' + key, 'start_' + key, 'end_' + key);
    console.log('Action took ' + measure.duration);
  }
  
  // change this based on how powerful the computer is
  const size = 10000000;
  // the input is a list of size 'size' containing random values from 1 to 50000
  const input = [];
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
    input.push(rand(1, 50000));
  
  // a comparison function between two items a and b
  function comparisonFunction(a, b) {
    if (a &gt; b)
      return 1;
    if (a &lt; b)
      return -1;
    return 0;
  }
  
  const output = [];
  // copy input into output, then sort it using the comparison function
  // same copying method will be used for future code
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
      output.push(input[i]);
    output.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; It's not the crispest code in the world, but it's simple to understand:</p> <ul><li>calcPerf is computing the time it takes for an action to take and logs it to the console</li> <li>start by creating a big array of random numbers as input</li> <li>the array in a result array and sorting it with the default sort function, to which we give the comparison function</li> <li>display the time it took for the operation.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; This takes about 4500 milliseconds on my computer.</p> <p>&nbsp; Focus on the comparison function. It takes two items and returns a number that is -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether the first item is smaller, equal or larger than the second. Now let's consider the sorting algorithm itself. How does it work?</p> <p>&nbsp; A naive way to do it would be to find the smallest item in the list, move it to the first position in the array, then continue the process with the rest of the array. This would have a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). If you don't know what the O complexity is, don't worry, it just provides an easy to spell approximation of how the amount of work would increase with the number of items in the input. In this case, 10 million records, squared, would lead to 100 trillion operations! That's not good.</p> <p>&nbsp; Other algorithms are much better, bringing the complexity to O(n*log(n)), so assuming base 10, around 70 million operations. But how do they improve on this? Surely in order to sort all items you must compare them to each other. The explanation is that if a&lt;b and b&lt;c you do not need to compare a to c. And each algorithm tries to get to this in a different way.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, the basic logic of sorting remains the same: compare all items with a subset of the other items.</p> <h2>Partitioning</h2> <p>&nbsp; A very common and recommended sorting algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="sometimes called partition-exchange sort, Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.">QuickSort</a>. I am not going to go through the entire history of sorting algorithms and what they do, you can check that out yourself, but I can focus on the important innovation that QuickSort added: partitioning. The first step in the algorithm is to choose a value out of the list of items, which the algorithm hopes it's as close as possible to the median value and is called a pivot, then arrange the items in two partitions: the ones smaller than the pivot and the ones larger than the pivot. Then it proceeds on doing the same to each partition until the partitions are small enough to be sorted by some other sort algorithm, like insertion sort (used by Chrome by default).</p> <p>&nbsp; Let's try to do this manually in our code, just the very first run of the step, to see if it improves the execution time. Lucky for us, we know that the median is around 25000, as the input we generated contains random numbers from 1 to 50000. So let's copy the values from input into two output arrays, then sort each of them. The sorted result would be reading from the first array, then from the second!</p>  <pre><code>  // two output arrays, one for numbers below 25000, the other for the rest
  const output1 = [];
  const output2 = [];
  const pivot = 25000;
  
  calcPerf(() =&gt; {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      const val = input[i];
      if (comparisonFunction(val, pivot) &lt; 0)
        output1.push(val);
      else
        output2.push(val);
    }
    // sorting smaller arrays is cheaper
    output1.sort(comparisonFunction);
    output2.sort(comparisonFunction);
  });
</code></pre> <p>&nbsp; Now, the performance is slightly better. If we do this several times, the time taken would get even lower. The partitioning of the array by an operation that is essentially O(n) (we just go once through the entire input array) reduces the comparisons that will be made in each partition. If we would use the naive sorting, partitioning would reduce n<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>to n+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>+(n/2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;(once for each partitioned half), thus n+n<sup>2</sup>/2. Each partitioning almost halves the number of operations!</p> <p>&nbsp; So, how many times can we half the number of operations for? Imagine that we do this with an array of distinct values, from 1 to 10 million. In the end, we would get to partitions of just one element and that means we did a log<sub>2</sub>(n) number of operations and for each we added one n (the partitioning operation). That means that the total number of operations is... n*log(n). Each algorithm gets to this in a different way, but at the core of it there is some sort of partitioning, that b value that makes comparing a and c unnecessary.</p> <p>&nbsp; Note that we treated the sort algorithm as "generic", meaning we fed it a comparison function between any two items, as if we didn't know how to compare numbers. That means we could have used any type of data as long as we knew the rule for comparison between items.</p> <p>&nbsp; There are other types of sorting algorithms that only work on specific types of data, though. Some of them claim a complexity of O(n)! But before we get to them, let's make a short detour.</p> <h3>Distinct values</h3> <p>&nbsp; Another useful operation with lists of items is finding the list of distinct items. From [1,2,2,3] we want to get [1,2,3]. To do this, we often use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated; i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure.">trie</a>, a tree-like data structure that is used for quickly finding if a value exists or not in a list. It's the thing used for autocorrect or finding a word in a dictionary. It has an O(log n) complexity in checking if an item exists. So in a list of 10 million items, it would take maybe 20 operations to find the item exists or not. That's amazing! You can see that what it does is partition the list down to the item level.</p> <p>&nbsp; Unfortunately, this only works for numbers and strings and such primitive values. If we want to make it generic, we need to use a function that determines when two items are equal and then we use it to compare to all the other items we found as distinct so far. That makes using a trie impossible.</p> <p>&nbsp; Let me give you an example: we take [1,1,2,3,3,4,5] and we use an externally provided equality function:</p> <ul><li>create an empty output of distinct items</li> <li>take first item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (none)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to output</li> <li>take next item (1) and compare with existing distinct items (1)</li> <li>item is found, so we do nothing</li> <li>...</li> <li>we take the last item (5) and compare with existing items (1,2,3,4)</li> <li>item is not found, so we add it to the output</li></ul> <p>&nbsp; The number of operations that must be taken is the number of total items multiplied by the average number of distinct items. That means that for a list of already distinct values, the complexity if O(n<sup>2</sup>). Not good! It increases exponentially with the number of items. And we cannot use a trie unless we have some function that would provide us with a distinctive primitive value for an item. So instead of an equality function, a hashing function that would return a number or maybe a string.</p> <p>&nbsp; However, given the knowledge we have so far, we can reduce the complexity of finding distinct items to O(n*log(n))! It's as simple as sorting the items, then going through the list and sending to output an item when different from the one before. One little problem here: we need a comparison function for sorting, not an equality one.</p> <h2>So far</h2> <p>&nbsp; We looked into the basic operations of sorting and finding distinct values. To be generic, one has to be provided with a comparison function, the other with an equality function. However, if we would have a comparison function available, finding distinct generic items would become significantly less complex by using sorting. Sorting is better than exponential comparison because it uses partitioning as an optimization trick.</p> <h2>Breaking the n*log(n) barrier</h2> <p>&nbsp; As I said above, there are algorithms that claim a much better performance than n*log(n). One of them is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called bucket sort and digital sort.">RadixSort</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstsort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="cache-efficient algorithms for sorting strings. They are variants of the traditional radix sort but faster for large data sets of common strings, first published in 2003, with some optimizing versions published in later years.">BurstSort</a> is a version of it, optimized for strings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.">CountSort</a> is a similar algorithm, as well. The only problem with Radix type algorithms is that they only work on numbers or recursively on series of numbers. How do they do that? Well, since we know we have numbers to sort, we can use math to partition the lot …</p></div></div>

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | A task takes an e and measures performance.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> { measure <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> p } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Profunctor</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p

<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

And by both measures, the numbers are dramatically lower.</p>  <p>Births considered very premature —&nbsp;born at fewer than 29 to 32 weeks&nbsp;— have&nbsp;dropped by&nbsp;34&nbsp;to 40 per cent, he said.</p>  <p>"If we use their gestational age and if we are talking about the very earliest preemies,"&nbsp;Alshaikh&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"That's kind of dramatic, actually, and surprising for us."</p>  <p>The numbers are even more dramatic for babies under one kilogram.</p>  <p>"If we used birth weight, those babies born less than one kilo, the number was actually very low and half of what we used to see in the last few years, during the same period of time of the year."</p>    <p>Alshaikh said the trend is very unusual.</p>  <p>"Soon after the lockdown in mid-March, we started to see fewer babies coming to our unit and to intensive care units, and these numbers of preemies were also low in April and mid-May," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So by that time, by late May, we felt like we needed to look at the numbers, and see where we are. And also at that time we started hearing that other hospitals, in Ireland and Denmark, have also noticed the drop down in the number of preemies."</p>  <p>When Calgary doctors took a good look at the numbers and compared them to the same time last year, it was an eyeopener.</p>  <p>"We were surprised," Alshaikh said. "We saw that our number is way lower than what we used to see during this period of time."</p>  <p>There are three main causes that doctors are looking at.</p>  <p>One is social distancing, which may have cut down on the amount of general infection from contact with others.</p>  <p>Another is less air pollution, from fewer cars being on the roads.</p>  <p>"This might actually help because studies in the past showed that air pollution actually increases the risk for preterm birth," Alshaikh said.</p>  <p>And simply not going out to work — resting — may be a final key.</p>  <p>"By staying home, a pregnant woman may have less stress from commuting and from work,&nbsp; and that might have helped them," Alshaikh said, adding it's too soon to know for sure which of these lockdown-related factors have contributed the most.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/premature-babies.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/premature-babies.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/premature-babies.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/premature-babies.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Calgary doctors who noticed a reduced number of premature births during the pandemic lockdown, are seeing those numbers rise again as restrictions have eased.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jim Lynch, Flickr cc)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>&nbsp;"We see sometimes variation during the year, but it's not to the degree that we see fewer babies," Alshaikh said. "And the fact that we see the same trend in Ireland, in Denmark in Australia, it's kind of surprising for everyone working in this field."</p>  <p>Preterm birth comes with a host of challenges for the babies and their parents.</p>  <p>"The risk is high on children and their families, and also medical care resources," Alshaikh said. "For children, the risk increases for vision and hearing problems, and also for learning disability. It's higher even as the gestational age goes down. For example,&nbsp; 24 weeks is at very high risk compared to babies born at 28 weeks gestation or at 32 weeks gestation."</p>  <h2>Doctors teaming up to study</h2>  <p>The Calgary doctors will continue to study the phenomenon, which could hold clues to reducing preterm births in general.</p>  <p>For now, Alshaikh said it's too early to provide any specific advice to pregnant woman — other than to avoid stress, try to rest at home, get a lot of sleep&nbsp;and focus on good nutrition.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've teamed up, actually, with the teams across the world, in Ireland and also in Denmark, and there is also a group in Manitoba working on this project, and we are hoping to understand more the ways to prevent the preterm birth, and also like to see if we can understand more on risk factors that are affecting preterm birth," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the Calgary doctor said there is one alarming development already —&nbsp;as the lockdown restriction ease, those preterm birth numbers are already on the rise again.</p>  <p>"We are actually noticing, even in Calgary, that when the restrictions started to be eased, the number of preterm babies coming to our unit and intensive care is going up again, which is quite actually interesting for us," Alshaikh said. "And we are trying to tease out what factors are affecting this trend."</p>  <p><strong>With files from <em><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-97-the-homestretch">The Homestretch</a></em>.</strong></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h3>What is the Blueprint?</h3>

<p>The Draft Blueprint ("the Blueprint") is the "first draft" of Plan Bay Area 2050, integrating 25 resilient and equitable strategies from the predecessor <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/horizon">Horizon initiative</a>. The Blueprint is a critical step in the Plan Bay Area 2050 process as the region strives to advance towards the adopted Vision of a more affordable, connected, diverse, healthy and vibrant Bay Area for all.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Input</h3>

<p><strong>Public input is key in the success of the Plan Bay Area 2050 Blueprint, and we want to hear from you in 3 easy steps:</strong></p>

<ol><li>Read the <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/pdfs_referenced/PBA2050_Draft_BPStrategies_071320_0.pdf">Blueprint Strategies</a> and <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/sites/default/files/PBA2050_Draft_BPOutcomes_071720.pdf">Blueprint Outcomes</a></li>

</ol><h3>Public Workshops</h3>

<p>See the list of <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/meetings-and-events#events">upcoming Public Workshops</a> and join us in real time to learn more and share your feedback.</p>

<h3>From <em>Horizon</em> to the Blueprint to the Plan</h3>

<p>Before now, the Horizon Initiative tested strategies against a wide range of external forces, exploring which policies and investments were best prepared for an uncertain future – from rising telecommute levels to economic boom &amp; bust cycles to consumer preference shifts. Creating the Blueprint is a key first step toward creating the Plan itself, and thus the Blueprint planning phase will require iteration and deep engagement of the public, stakeholders and elected officials.</p>

<p>The Plan Bay Area 2050 Draft Blueprint weaves together transportation, housing, economic and environmental strategies, alongside an expanded set of growth geographies, to advance critical climate and equity goals. Designed to accommodate the 1.5 million new homes necessary to house future growth and address overcrowding, as well as 1.4 million new jobs, the Draft Blueprint integrates critical strategies to address our severe and longstanding housing crisis. With infrastructure investments in walking, biking and public transportation – as well as critical sea level protections designed to keep most Bay Area communities from flooding through 2050 – the Draft Blueprint makes meaningful steps towards the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Vision.</p>

<p>While still remaining fiscally constrained per federal planning requirements, the Draft Blueprint includes available revenues from Needs and Revenue assessments as well as new regional revenues for transportation, housing, economic development and environmental resilience.</p>

<h3>Highlights of the Draft Blueprint include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Improving Affordability for All:</strong> The Draft Blueprint reduces the cost burden for housing and transportation, with even greater reductions for low-income residents.</li>
	<li><strong>Expanding Housing Opportunities:</strong> The Draft Blueprint integrates investments to build more than 400,000 new permanently-affordable homes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing Growth in Walkable Places:</strong> The Draft Blueprint focuses the majority of new homes and new jobs in walkable communities with frequent transit services.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving Lives and Protecting Communities:</strong> In addition to saving more than 1,500 lives from roadway crashes through 2050, the Draft Blueprint also protects 98 percent of housing units at risk of sea level rise inundation through the year 2050 with new resilient infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Positioning the Region for Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Despite over $200 billion in new taxes in the decades ahead to pay for the bold strategies approved in February 2020, Bay Area businesses are forecasted to rebound robustly.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>

<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

<p>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data. </p>



<div><p>Tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clicktale.com/" target="_blank">Clicktale </a>take these one step further and actually provide real-time playback of what a user is doing on a website. This is also possible across sessions and even can follow a user from signup all the way through onboarding – it’s really up to you. At first glance, this seems like a godsend. The ability to actually watch what people do on your site – where they get stuck or what they’re reading when they ultimately convert or exit is one of the more powerful funnel optimization tools to come out in the past decade. I personally can attest to their efficacy. They helped me drop a SaaS CAC from $1,250 to $100 in 3 months. </p><p>There are many other instances in which I have gone into a business, implemented one of these tools, and improved conversion rates by an order of magnitude in a fraction of the time it used to take. In just a few days of watching sessions it is possible to tell:</p></div>



<ul><li>What is preventing users from converting</li><li>Where are customers losing interest in the page</li><li>Why people are dropping out of the checkout process</li><li>What content users focus in on and what they skim past</li><li>What part of the site or app crashed and how did it happen</li></ul>



<p>These are all incredibly powerful insights in the hands of a skilled marketer, so what gives? Why doesn’t everyone secretly record their users and optimize based on the data? First, its helpful to understand what session replay is, and what it isn’t…</p>



<h2>What EXACTLY is Session Replay?</h2>



<p>Session Replay is precisely what it sounds like – the ability for the site owner, or someone else, to replay the session a specific user experienced while on the site. It includes scroll activity, mouse activity, clicks, swipes, taps, and just about any other action you can think of on a website. It has a lot of other names but session replay is generally the widely accepted term that these SaaS platforms use themselves.</p>



<p>It lets you see EXACTLY where someone gets stuck so that you can design a way to fix it and reduce the friction within whatever action you’re trying to get a user to take. It can also let you remotely diagnose speed or loading issues for customers – taking it one step beyond tools like Lighthouse. Being able to see specifically which files load slowly in the real world and on real users’ devices is amazing from an optimization standpoint.</p>



<p>With that being said, these tools themselves carry a pretty heavy payload and can slow down your site by a double-digit percentage on their own. On their own they are not enough to improve the efficacy of your site or app – they need to be wielded by a scrappy marketer who can identify the issues and implement solutions to solve them. </p>



<h2>Visionary or Voyeur?</h2>



<p>While periodically I feel like a voyeur when using these tools, I do see the benefits and generally feel they outweigh the privacy concerns. In my experience the friction in implementing these tools generally comes from the engineering team who feels like they infringe on privacy rights. Are they right? Well, sort of. Out of the box these tools have the ability to record usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. That is where the implementation of the tool, both from a tech standpoint and from a configuration standpoint within the platform comes into play.  It is easy to block certain fields from recording into these tools, but generally, it has to be done manually.</p>



<p>FullStory blocks password and CC number by default but those can both be disabled by a less than honest marketer in order to get additional information about a customer. While I have never seen or heard that happening myself, it is certainly possible as these tools don’t require the obfuscation of some of the more sensitive data. </p>



<p>Some point to the feeling of “big brother” watching your users browse around on the website. Which is kind of what it is doing, but the blind spot here is that the marketer (me) generally doesn’t care who the user is – they just want to know what is getting in the way of the conversion, something session replay does better than any other tool out there at the moment. If the dataset were wiped of any personally identifiable information, it would still be useful to watch anonymized sessions move through a funnel and pinpoint friction.</p>



<div><p>Technically you’re also supposed to list the fact that you are using these types of programs within your Privacy Policy or EULA, and you’re even supposed to be able to toggle the script on or off within a “cookie bar” in order to totally comply with today’s regulations but I have yet to see that actually happen.</p><p>Additionally, who knows what these companies are doing with the data they have? Could they be mining it only to sell advice on optimizing funnels to the highest bidder? It really does allow for a lot of data and PII to cross into the unknown. How can someone even opt-out of this data collection if they wanted to? </p></div>



<h2>Are They Worth Using?</h2>



<p>The short answer is yes. On the surface you cant find a much more effective tool at optimizing the behavior on your website. The magic combo would be to combine session replay with a CRO tool like Optimizely or VWO to identify issues and then implement tests to counter them.</p>



<p>The longer answer depends on your conscious. In a time where people are increasingly worried about identity theft, facial recognition, and giving too much data to big tech companies, session replay does straddle the line between effective optimization tool and privacy nightmare. It’s worth evaluating the stance of your company on privacy and data security issues before implementing one of these tools.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Osama Bin Laden wearing Casio FW91" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=239%2C300&amp;ssl=1 239w, https://i1.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/obl_AP070817055372-1.jpg?resize=335%2C420&amp;ssl=1 335w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Osama bin Laden wearing the iconic F-91W.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>

<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

  <div><p>I sort of feel swamped by things that I don't know, almost to the point of paralysis.</p></div><div><p>I'm new to Ruby on Rails and know that there is a huge ocean of knowledge that I could keep swimming in, but then again I'm competent enough to build this reasonably functioning Taaalk website. I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

            <div><div>
  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>This essay will hopefully be the first post in a series covering some of the basics of how things in the past, particularly in the ancient world, were made.  This isn’t a how-to guide (we’re not going to go into that much depth) but instead intended as a window into the many tasks that made a pre-modern society <em>work</em>, tasks that are so often <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">left </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/19/the-lonely-city-part-ii-real-cities-have-curves/">out </a>of the modern imagination of the past.  Throughout, I want to highlight not only the jobs, but also <strong>the people who did them</strong> and the <strong>human landscapes they created</strong>.</p>



<p>Each entry in this series is likely to come in multiple parts – as you will soon see, almost everything worth making has to be made in quite a few steps and each step is often complex enough to occupy its own weekly post.  I <em>think</em> this series will run in four parts (possibly with a fifth part addendum), but no plan survives contact with my tendency to overwrite.  I wanted to start with farming instead of something more flashy and exciting like iron production (where I know there is quite a lot of interest in how one goes from reddish rock to polished sword), for the simple reason that <strong>agriculture sits at the foundation of every other form of production</strong>.  Every person in an agrarian society whose job – mining, smithing, tanning, timber-cutting, trading, tailoring, <em>everything</em> – doesn’t involve primary food production is subsisting off of the food production of others, typically (as we’ll see) <em>many</em> others.</p>



<p>That said, <em>this post</em> is mostly about <strong>farmers</strong> more than <em>farming</em> (we will talk about the mechanics of farming, just not right away!).  One thing I want to highlight in this series are the many different jobs and occupations <em>and the people who did them</em> who tend to lurk in the background of our imagination of the past, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">where they appear at all</a>.  And in the case of farming in much of the pre-modern world, the survival strategies of subsistence farmers exert a very strong shaping influence on the countryside and life for non-farmers (terminology note: ‘subsistence’ farming refers to farming directed primarily towards the survival of the farmers and their families; in much of the pre-modern world, there was a fairly sharp divide between <em>most</em> farmers who farmed on a subsistence basis and the largest market-oriented estates of the wealthy, who will be our focus <em>next</em> week).</p>



<p>As a final caveat before we dive in, I specialize in the economy of the ancient Mediterranean, so my observations here are going to tend (where not otherwise noted) to be <em>most</em> true in the Mediterranean world, in that period (c. 650 BC – 450 AD).  Where I know there are major exceptions, I’ll try to note them, but it’s simply not possible to know every production permutation <em>everywhere</em> and at <em>every</em> time.  For this series, we’re going to focus on wheat production, with a bit of a Mediterranean bias (but I’ve tried to pull in some evidence from North China as well; by and large I’ve found that wheat cultivation seems to create <em>similar </em>patterns everywhere, but there is local variation).</p>

<p><strong>Bibliography note at the outset</strong>: for the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have an easy footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but I’ll include a bibliography note up front for the whole series.  My information for the ancient Mediterranean is drawn from a number of sources, the most important of which are P. Erdkamp, <em>The Grain Market in the Roman Empire</em> (2005); N. Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War: Farms, Families and Death in the Middle Republic</em> (2004); Foxhall and Forbes, “Σιτομετρεία: The Role of Grain as a Staple Food in Classical Antiquity,” <em>Chiron</em> 12 (1982) and Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” <em>JRS</em> 80 (1990), and just reading a pile of Greek and Roman agricultural writers (Columella, Cato, Pliny the Elder, Xenophon, etc).<br>Note also C. Fischer-Bovet, <em>Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt</em> (2014), W. Scheidel, <em>Death on the Nile</em> (2001) and R. Bagnall and B. Frier, <em>The Demography of Roman Egypt </em>(1994) for the Egyptian demographic modeling.  Egypt is an important reference for demographic data because relatively more records survive there due to the arid conditions preserving papyrus.<br>I am less well read on Medieval European agriculture, but I should note some reliance here on M. Bloch, <em><em>La Société Féodale</em></em> (1940; available trans. Manyon, 1962) and E.L.R. Ladurie, <em>Les Paysans de Languedoc</em> (1966; available trans. J. Day, 1976).  Also relevant on general features and broad continuity, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge</em> (2003); for the military history minded, Landers (and Rosenstein) are more focused on the connection between agriculture and military activity.<br>My references to Chinese agriculture are from Cho-yun Hsu, <em>Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy</em> (1980).</p>



<h2>Why Bread?</h2>



<p>From the outset I want to note that agriculture, especially subsistence agriculture, typically is not planting simple mono-cultures of a single crop.  I opted to focus in this series on <strong>bread</strong> because it is <em><strong>usefully simple</strong></em> for a number of reasons.  It lets us focus on wheat and barley, which are relatively simple crops to talk about but also (in the broad sweep of Eurasia where they were the primary crop) provided the majority of calories for the <em><strong>vast</strong></em> majority of people.  Vegetables, fruit, meat, other animal products (along with sauces and things derived from them) were in the ancient Mediterranean generally expensive things, used by most normal people (read: the not-super-rich) to <em>flavor</em> a meal that still consisted mostly of bread, when they were available at all.  That’s because (as we’ll see) wheat and barley were efficient and cheap to grow at scale.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean that people <em>only</em> ate bread, to be clear.  The Mediterranean diet is built on a <em>triad</em> of grapes, grains and olives; animal products were also in the diet.  Grains don’t have a broad enough range of nutrients to really subsist someone forever; you need proteins and vitamins and so on.  <strong><em>But</em></strong> when we are looking at the bulk of what was eaten any way we measure it – calories, volume, weight, labor intensity, economic scale – cheap, mass-available grains just dominate, so that’s where we start.  When scholars model ancient agriculture and food habits, they build a nutritional model centered on grains and then supplement with other things as necessary (which as an aside is <em>also</em> how the Greeks and Romans actually talk about food – rations that we are quite sure included meat and vegetables are typically given as grain allowances, e.g. Thuc 4.16.1; Plut. <em>Lyc</em>. 12.2; Plb. 6.39.13; Cato, <em>de Agr.</em> 56).</p>



<p>Finally, a <strong>terminology note</strong>: when I say <strong>wheat</strong> I mean genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"><em>triticum</em> </a>and its subspecies; when I say <strong>barley</strong> I mean <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">Hordeum vulgare</a></em>.  I am going to use ‘grain’ or ‘grains’ to refer to both crops together (although there are many other grains).  The British frequently use the word ‘corn’ to refer to wheat; this causes no end of confusion in Americans, for whom ‘corn’ means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize">maize</a>.  I do not know that I will reference maize, but if I do, I will call it maize and to avoid confusion, I am not going to use corn at all as a term.  Apologies to my British readers whose usage is, I should note, older but also more confusing.</p>



<p>To start with, we need to start not with our crops, <strong>but with our farm and farmers.</strong></p>



<h2>The Farming Household</h2>



<p>Looking at our peasant household, what we generally have are large families on small farms.  The households in these farms were not generally nuclear households, but extended ones.  Pre-Han Chinese documents assume a household to include three generations: two elderly parents, their son, his wife, and their four children (eight individuals total).  Ptolemaic and Roman census data reveal a bewildering array of composite families, including multi-generational homes, but also households composed of multiple nuclear families of siblings (so a man, his wife, his brother and then brother’s wife and their children, for instance), and so on.<strong>  Normal family units tended to be around eight individuals, but with wide variation</strong> (for comparison, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/families/households.html">the average household size in the United States for a family is 3.14</a>).</p>

<p>At the same time that households <strong>were <em>large</em> (by modern standards), the farms they tilled were, by modern standards, very small</strong>.  The normal size of a Roman household small farm is generally estimated between 5 and 8 <em>iugera</em> (a Roman measurement of land, roughly 3 to 5 acres); in pre-Han Northern China (where wheat and millet, not rice, were the staple crops), the figure was “one hundred mu (4.764 acres)” – essentially the same.  In Languedoc, a study of Saint-Thibery in 1460 showed 118 households (out of 189) on farms of less than 20 <em>setérée</em> (12 acres or so; the <em>setérée </em>appears to be an inexact unit of measurement); 96 of them were on less than 10 <em>setérée</em> (about 6 acres).  So while there is a <em>lot</em> of variation, <strong>by and large it seems like the largest cluster of household farms tend to be around 3 to 8 acres or so; 5 acre farms are a good ‘average’ small farm.</strong></p>



<p>This coincidence of normal farm size and family size is not an accident, but essentially represents …</p></div></div>

				<p>An irrational number is a number that can’t be represented as a fraction using integers for the numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of irrational numbers, and one of the biggest reasons for that is that they are great at making low discrepancy sequences, which give amazing results when used in stochastic (randomized) algorithms, compared to regular random numbers.  Low discrepancy sequences are cousins to blue noise because they both aim to keep samples well spread out, but the usage case is different, so it’s situational whether to use blue noise or an LDS.  That means that luckily there is room enough in the world for both LDS and blue noise.</p>
<p>This post is a random grab bag of things relating to irrational numbers.</p>
<p>Pythagorian cultists supposedly murdered someone to keep irrational numbers a secret, so this is technically forbidden knowledge, I guess.</p>

<p>Continued fractions are a way of writing numbers that can be useful for helping analyze irrational numbers, and rational approximations to specific numbers – whether they are rational or irrational.</p>
<p>If a continued fraction is infinitely long, that means it represents an irrational number, and all irrational numbers have continued fractions that are infinitely long.  If a continued fraction is not infinitely long, that means it’s a rational number.</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the continued fraction for pi.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Another way of writing continued fractions is to get rid of all the redundant “1 divided by…” and just write the integers you see on the left.  The continued fraction for pi above would look like this, which is a lot more compact:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how you make a continued fraction by walking through how to make it for pi, or at least 3.14159265359 anyways, since pi goes forever.</p>
<p>First up you take the integer part and use that as the first digit.  Subtracting that integer part out leaves you with a remainder:</p>
<p>[3]<br>
remainder: 0.14159265359 </p>
<p>We take 1/remainder to get 7.06251330592.  The integer part of this number is going to be our next number.  Subtracting the integer part out gives us our next remainder:</p>
<p>[3;7]<br>
remainder: 0.06251330592</p>
<p>1/remainder is 15.9965944095, which makes our next integer and remainder into:</p>
<p>[3;7,15]<br>
remainder: 0.9965944095</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.00341722818, so now we are at…</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]<br>
remainder: 0.00341722818</p>
<p>1/remainder is 292.63483365 so now we are at:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292]<br>
remainder: 0.63483365</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.57521580653 and we’ll stop at the next step:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292, 1]<br>
remainder: 0.57521580653</p>
<p>Wherever you have a large number in the continued fraction, it’s because you just did one divided by a small number. The larger the integer means the smaller the remainder there was to make that integer.</p>
<p>The smaller a remainder is, the better approximated the number is at that step of the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This means that when you see a large number in a continued fraction, that if you truncated the continued fraction right before that large number, you’d have a pretty good approximation of the actual number that the continued fraction represents.</p>
<p>The larger the number, the better the approximation.</p>
<p>Because of this, looking at the continued fraction for pi, below, you can see that it has a pretty large number (292) pretty early in the sequence.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>This means that the following continued fraction approximates pi “pretty well”.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]</p>
<p>We’ll cover how to figure this out further down in the post, but that fraction is actually 355/113 and has a special name “Milü”, found by Chinese mathematician and astronomer, Zǔ Chōngzhī, born 429 AD.  It is within 0.000009% of the value of pi.</p>
<p>More info from wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC</a></p>
<p>So, while pi is probably the most famous irrational number, it certain isn’t the most irrational number that there is, as it is so easily approximated by smallish integers in a division.</p>
<p>Quick note if you write a program to convert a floating point number to a continued fraction: If you try to make a continued fraction for a number that a floating point can’t represent exactly – such as 4.1 – you will get a very tiny remainder which then makes a very large integer when you flip it over.  In my case, when using doubles, it made such a large number that converting it to an integer overflowed the integer.  One way to address this is to just consider any remainder smaller than some threshold as zero.  Like maybe any remainder less than 0.00001 can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So even though pi is not the most irrational number, phi is (pronounced “fee”, and is aka the golden ratio).  Yes, it is the most irrational number!</p>
<p>We’ll use the value 1.61803398875 and make a continued fraction.</p>
<p>[1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1,1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>Wait a second… do you see a pattern? the remainder is always the same value, and then when we do 1/remainder we always get the golden ratio again.  That means this continued fraction is 1’s all the way into infinity.</p>
<p>In the last section we saw how having a large number in the continued fraction meant that a number was well approximated at that point in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>The golden ratio has a 1 for every number in the continued fraction, which is the smallest value you can have. That means it’s as least well approximated as you can be, at every stage in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the golden ratio being the most irrational number.  It’s the least well approximated by rational numbers (dividing one integer by another).</p>
<p>When I said I liked irrational numbers I was mainly talking about the golden ratio, but other highly irrational numbers, like the square root of 2, are also nice.  Highly irrational numbers have the properties that I like – the properties that make them useful to use as low discrepancy sequences.</p>
<p>An interesting thing you may have noticed above is that when you divide 1 by the golden ratio, you get the golden ratio minus 1.  That is:</p>
<p>1 / 1.61803398875 = 0.61803398875</p>
<p>If you replace the golden ratio with “x” you get this equation:</p>
<p>1/x = x-1</p>
<p>If you solve that equation, you will get the golden ratio out.  It is the only number that has this property! Well actually, -0.61803398875 does too, and relates to the fact that there is a + and – root solution to that quadratic equation, but maybe that’s not that surprising.  1/-0.61803398875 is -1.61803398875. The behavior is the same, it’s just happening on the other side of zero.</p>
<p>Something else interesting about the golden ratio is that if you square it, it’s the same as adding 1.</p>
<p>1.61803398875*1.61803398875=2.61803398875</p>
<p>That gives you a formula:</p>
<p>x*x = x+1</p>
<p>If you solve that, you get the golden ratio again as the only solution (well, and the negative golden ratio minus 1 just like before).  Probably not too surprising if you look at the formulas though, as you can use simple algebra to change one formula into the other.</p>

<p>If you had a continued fraction and wanted to turn it into a regular fraction (or real number), you could run the process in reverse.</p>
<p>However, doing that means you start at the right most digit of the continued fraction and work left til you get to the beginning. How do you do this with an infinitely long continued fraction, like an irrational number would have?</p>
<p>Luckily there is a way to start at the left and work right, so that you can get approximations to infinitely long continued fractions (irrational numbers).</p>
<p>Let’s do this with pi, with this much of the continued fraction:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1]</p>
<p>What you do is make a table which has a row for the numerator and denominator.  The first numerator is 1, and the first denominator is 0.  The second numerator is the first number in the continued fraction sequence, and the second denominator is 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>The formula for the rest of the numerators and denominators is…</p>
<ul>
<li>numerator[index] = CF[index] * numerator[index-1] + numerator[index-2]</li>
<li>denominator[index] = CF[index] * denominator[index-1] + denominator[index-2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing that from left to right, you get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Below we do that with pi, golden ratio, sqrt(2) and an irrational number i came up with that is not very irrational, and is well approximated by 1.01.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>A quick fun tangent is that you might notice that for golden ratio, both the numerators and denominators are the Fibonacci numbers.  This is the link between the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>Below shows the percentage error of each number, as more terms in the continued fraction are added.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Golden ratio error decreases the slowest which shows that the golden ratio is least well approximated by fractions.  The made up irrational number that is approximately 1.01 has error decreasing the fastest because it is the least irrational of these numbers.  Pi shows itself as having fairly low irrationality, and the square root of 2 is fairly irrational.</p>
<p>Here is the error on a log y axis to better show the difference in error.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that 1/goldenRatio aka 0.61803398875 is every bit as irrational as the golden ratio itself is.  The reason for this is that we are flipping the numerator and denominator over for this fraction that doesn’t exist.  Flipping it over doesn’t make it more representable as a fraction.</p>
<p>When I’m using the golden ratio for low discrepancy sequences, i usually use that 1/goldenRatio value, also known as “the golden ratio conjugate” because the smaller value means it’s going to have fewer numerical issues and more precision, when working with small values (like between 0 and 1).</p>
<p>Also, there are an infinite amount of numbers just as irrational as the golden ratio.  You can calculate them by calculating:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27+%3D+%28p%2Aa%2Bq%29+%2F+%28r%2Aa%2Bs%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0" alt="a' = (p*a+q) / (r*a+s)" title="a' = (p*a+q) / (r*a+s)"></p>
<p>where p,q,r,s are integers and the absolute value of p*s-q*r is 1.</p>
<p>That is the Moebius transform.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the least irrational number is, it looks like there are multiple (infinite) and they are just numbers that …</p></div></div>

    <p>How computationally expensive are various fundamental floating point mathematical operations? &nbsp;Here’s a quick and dirty benchmark, which, although surely quite naive, seems to capture the rough&nbsp;relative cost of a few operations.</p>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<p>This quarter I am taking a course on&nbsp;numerical linear algebra. &nbsp;Naturally, we are covering topics like the fundamentals of floating point arithmetic, numerical stability, matrix decompositions, and algorithm analysis.</p>

<p>In a few of our assignments, we are&nbsp;tasked with determining the <em>exact number of floating point operations</em> (FLOPs) required to execute some particular algorithm. Analyzing the complexity of algorithms is certainly a useful exercise, but it’s silly to give the impression that we can produce the <em>exact</em> FLOP count. &nbsp;I’m not much of a hardware guy, but I at least know that modern CPUs are stupendously complex, and any FLOP count we can write down on paper after inspecting pseudocode has no chance at being “exact” in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Besides the overall futility of these exercises, we are instructed to&nbsp;consider each of the following operations as a&nbsp;baseline of “1 FLOP”: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root. &nbsp;As we will see shortly, these operations are not even close to equivalent in terms of real-world computational expense, so it’s misleading to count these all as&nbsp;equal atoms&nbsp;of computation.</p>

<p>Anyways… on one recent assignment we were asked to look at the FLOP count for some technique that used a rotation matrix. &nbsp;As you might expect for rotation-y stuff, the matrix entries were based on various trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, arctan). &nbsp;I was in a rush when doing the assignment, so I casually assigned 1 FLOP to each of these trig functions. &nbsp;I felt partially justified in doing this, as I had <a href="http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/" target="_blank">just learned</a> that these trig functions are in fact offered as single CPU instructions in modern Intel x86. &nbsp;Given that we were glossing over so much already, it seemed excusable&nbsp;to consider as atomic anything that can theoretically be done in a single CPU instruction. Regardless, I was&nbsp;docked points. Hmph.</p>

<p>OK fine, I’m not&nbsp;worried about the points, but now I’m&nbsp;curious about how expensive these operations really are. &nbsp;If “square root” qualifies as 1 FLOP, is it really so wrong to lump in “sine” as 1 FLOP, too?</p>

<h4 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h4>

<p>I dusted off the C++ region of my brain, and hacked up the following test program. It was fun to (ab)use macros heavily here.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

// timer cribbed from
// https://gist.github.com/gongzhitaao/7062087
class Timer
{
public:
    Timer() : beg_(clock_::now()) {}
    void reset() { beg_ = clock_::now(); }
    double elapsed() const {
        return duration_cast&lt;second_&gt;
            (clock_::now() - beg_).count();
    }

private:
    typedef high_resolution_clock clock_;
    typedef duration&lt;double, ratio&lt;1&gt;&gt; second_;
    time_point&lt;clock_&gt; beg_;
};

int main(char* argv)
{
    double total;
    Timer tmr;

#define randf() ((double) rand()) / ((double) (RAND_MAX))
#define OP_TEST(name, expr)               \
    total = 0.0;                          \
    srand(42);                            \
    tmr.reset();                          \
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++) { \
        double r1 = randf();              \
        double r2 = randf();              \
        total += expr;                    \
    }                                     \
    double name = tmr.elapsed();          \
    printf(#name);                        \
    printf(" %.7f\n", name - baseline);

    // time the baseline code:
    //   for loop with no extra math op
    OP_TEST(baseline, 1.0)

    // time various floating point operations.
    //   subtracts off the baseline time to give
    //   a better approximation of the cost
    //   for just the specified operation
    OP_TEST(plus, r1 + r2)
    OP_TEST(minus, r1 - r2)
    OP_TEST(mult, r1 * r2)
    OP_TEST(div, r1 / r2)
    OP_TEST(sqrt, sqrt(r1))
    OP_TEST(sin, sin(r1))
    OP_TEST(cos, cos(r1))
    OP_TEST(tan, tan(r1))
    OP_TEST(atan, atan(r1))
    OP_TEST(exp, exp(r1))
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>Compiling this benchmark non-optimized (so that nothing gets erased or rearranged) and running on my Intel Core i7 machine, I get the following results. &nbsp;I’ve normalized so results are relative to the cost of “plus.”</p>

<p><img src="https://latkin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FLOPchart1.png" alt="benchmark results"></p>

<p>So&nbsp;of the “1 FLOP” operations, it turns out&nbsp;division and square root are really about 4x and 6x as expensive, respectively, as the baseline of addition.&nbsp;Trig functions appear to land somewhere in the 15x-20x range, and exp about 10x.</p>

<p>So yes, trig functions&nbsp;really are significantly more expensive than +-*√ (though it still seems a bit arbitrary to count sqrt&nbsp;and division as 1 FLOP).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Measuring the productivity of most professions is exceptionally challenging. Would you measure a lawyer’s productivity by the number of cases they close? Or a doctor’s productivity by the number of operations they perform?</p><p>Moving to the software engineering realm, should your company start measuring lines of code produced by engineers? Please no. How about pull requests per engineer? Nah. Sprint velocity on the company level? 😬</p><p>While it may be tempting to get started with these metrics, resist the temptation. These metrics reward output, people who put in immense amounts of busywork. Another issue with these metrics is that they create unhealthy team dynamics - your company won’t be more successful if teams compete internally, save that energy for competitors. Instead, your productivity metrics should focus on outcomes.</p><p>I’ve tried to summarize my thoughts on the company, team and individual levels.</p><h2 id="Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level"><a href="#Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level" title="Driving business outcomes on the company level"></a>Driving business outcomes on the company level</h2><p>Let’s take a look at a recent study, the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a> and to what conclusions Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim arrived after four years of research. They identified the following key performance indicators of high performing engineering organizations: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore and change-fail percentage. Let’s take a look at them, one by one.</p><p><strong>Lead time</strong> is the amount of time it takes for the engineering teams to ship a feature, end-to-end. While it may be challenging to do this across the board (as features will differ in scope), you can simplify it a bit, and define it as the time it takes someone from opening a pull-request till deploying it to production.</p><p><strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is more straightforward, as the name suggests, it represents the number of production deployments over a given period.</p><p><strong>Mean time to restore</strong> represents the amount of time it takes to restore service, once you had an outage.</p><p><strong>Change-fail percentage</strong> tells you what percentage of your deployments result in an outage that you have to restore.</p><p>The beauty of these metrics is that they are relatively simple to track. I bet you are already using some CI/CD pipelines, so the deployment frequency is given. Mean time to restore and change-fail percentage is something that your post-mortem meetings should already record. Without question, the most challenging metric here is around lead-times: it will be a compound metric that you’ll derive from code review times, CI build times and deployment times.</p><blockquote><p>While the mean time to restore and change-fail percentage metrics may seem like purely reliability metrics, they are not. The worse those indicators are, the more time engineers will spend on incidents and less on features that your customers are paying for.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Team-health-metrics"><a href="#Team-health-metrics" title="Team health metrics"></a>Team health metrics</h2><p>I believe that candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive, high-functioning team. Managers, whether they are front-line managers or above, play a crucial role in creating a feedback culture: a culture where every employee feels safe and comfortable providing feedback to other members of the team, or of that of the broader organization.</p><p>While trust is not simple to measure either, anonymous surveys can help with it. By doing surveys for your teams regularly, you can also keep track of your progress in different areas (trust is just one of them).</p><p>Questions like these (well, more like statements that people have to agree or disagree with) might give you some idea of how you, as a manager, do when it comes to building trust:</p><ul><li>“My manager proactively solicits feedback.”</li><li>“My manager creates a safe environment, built on trust and respect.”</li><li>“I can communicate openly with my manager and my team about our work, even when I disagree.”</li></ul><p>Other areas you might want to gauge are vision, alignment, learning and adapting. Questions like this may be useful:</p><ul><li>“My manager learns from mistakes.”</li><li>“My manager acts on the feedback they receive.”</li><li>“My manager communicates how our team contributes to the company’s overall mission.”</li></ul><p>Please note that while this section focuses on team health, most of the questions are about the team’s manager. The reason for that is because most team members will try to model their behavior based on their manager. The manager’s actions have a profound effect on what the team will treat as desired, accepted or discouraged behaviors.</p><h2 id="Competencies-for-individuals"><a href="#Competencies-for-individuals" title="Competencies for individuals"></a>Competencies for individuals</h2><p>So far, we’ve covered what productivity metrics may look like on the company and team level: let’s take a look at how productivity can be measured on the individual level.</p><p>In my opinion, the work engineers have to do is way too complex to be measured by a single metric, like the number of pull requests an engineer opens, or the number of RFC they write. No metric can do justice in trying to capture the real work. So why bother?</p><p>Instead, engineering productivity should be measured against career ladders (tracks). What’s common in the career ladders most companies have, is that they identify a handful of critical competencies and behaviors that the company values and rewards. <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progression.fyi</a> has a good collection of open-sourced career ladders that you can look at. One of the reasons most companies should have an easily accessible and discoverable career ladder is because it helps set the expectations for both engineers and managers on what’s expected of them, and what they need to achieve to advance in their career at their current company.</p><p>Okay, but what does it have to do with engineering productivity? Everything. Creating a career ladder is the perfect opportunity for setting the example of a productive engineer for each level. As a manager, you’ll have a clear set of expectations and standards for each level, which helps you coach team members, whether they are struggling in their current role, or if they are preparing for a promotion.</p><hr><p>This is far from everything, but it summarizes what I’ve been thinking about the topic in the past couple of months. What are your thoughts on the subject? Please share them in the comments section below!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In today’s, in the past and probably in the future world — the time is more valuable than money, and the right time waits for no one. Hence, we have to make the most out of it to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Time is an extremely scarce resource.</p>
<p><strong>Every one of us has 24*60=1440 minutes a day, and totally about 28000 days to live</strong> (that’s how many days an average person lives since being born). And by the time you read this, you may have already lost significant chunk!</p>
<p>Developers can organize their day, maintain a busy schedule, feel very bored and unfulfilled, and never have enough time. Why so? Because often, the tasks they are doing throughout their day do not excite them or align with what they want—their goals and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t work towards your dreams and goals, you aren’t investing your time in yourself—you are wasting it.</strong></p>
<p>Wasting time is a choice, and it’s one that is entirely within your control. It is really important to make this choice on purpose (and not accidentally) and use your time effectively.</p>
<p>That’s why you should try to make each minute of each day count because every minute you sit idly doing nothing or wasting time, there is someone out there working hard towards the same goal gaining the edge over you.</p>
<p>Moreover, making better use of your time is also saving time. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively and productively because I procrastinated a lot in the past.</p>
<p>And here are some straightforward strategies that you can use to utilize your time better and feel much more fulfilled, energized, and happier:</p>
<h2 id="-set-goals">🎯 Set goals</h2>
<p>When you have goals you want to achieve, you are less likely to waste time on things not related to those goals: everything you do starts feeling that it has a purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If nobody told you today... You have a purpose and never give up on your goals.</p>— GOOD JOB LARRY 🍊 (@LarryJuneTFM) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarryJuneTFM/status/1278045173629349888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Besides, <strong>it’s crucial to establish processes and systems to achieve those goals!</strong></p>
<p>A process is a step-by-step action that helps you efficiently and systematically reach your goals. Not having a process is worse than not having a plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-prioritize-things">💎 Prioritize things</h2>
<p>Most developers have thousands of things (projects!!!) going on at any one time. The key is to focus only on what matters the most to move you toward your big goal.</p>
<p>You should align your time with your big picture priority. Everything else should go on the do-not-do-list! <a href="https://www.inc.com/jory-mackay/warren-buffetts-personal-pilot-reveals-billionaires-brilliant-method-for-prioritizing.html">Here is how Warren Buffet approaches it.</a></p>
<p><em>“It’s said that a wise person learns from his mistakes. A wiser one learns from others’ mistakes. But the wisest person of all learns from others’ successes.”— John C. Maxwell</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-say-no">🙅‍♀️ Say “No”</h2>
<p>Here I am still in the development process, but it has already become much better. I say “no” much more often today.</p>
<p>When I have inquiries of any kind or even my own project ideas, I always reflect on this principle: <strong>if you say yes to this, you automatically say no to something else.</strong> Because you can only do one thing at a time, is this thing more important than other things for achieving my goals?</p>
<p>This way, whole kinds of projects or requests fall through the grid—the filter which recognizes what really matters for me, for my most critical resource—my time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-less-calls-less-meetings">📆 Less calls, less meetings</h2>
<p>Time is an incredibly valuable asset in a product company, and especially in a startup business. When you spend the day sprinting from meeting to meeting, the time flies by.</p>
<p>In fact, most meetings are pointless. Some people like to attend meetings for the sake of meetings. Hence, you could cancel 70%-80% or more of them, making no difference in your work.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you schedule meetings for your developers every few hours the only way they make progress is if they don’t pay attention to the meeting at all.</p>— Frank Wiles (@fwiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/fwiles/status/1245718151607828489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Meetings might interrupt the workflow of individual contributors like developers and designers who need to concentrate for extended periods to deliver tangible value for the product. As a result, the working day of developers can turn into a long evening spending in front of the laptop while trying to mark some of those overdue items off their TODO-list.</p>
<p>Still, meetings are an essential function of communication on the team; that’s why it’s crucial to decide whether every scheduled meeting is worth your time before joining it.</p>

<h2 id="-time-for-emails">📬 Time for emails</h2>
<p>I don’t answer all emails immediately. I have a fixed time limit for emails; usually, I look at them just once per day, because answering emails and dealing with Slack/Teams messages can be scheduled just like everything else.</p>
<p>The power of time blocking for emails comes in choosing when you do this task instead of disturbing your focus and decreasing your productivity every moment of your day.</p>

<h2 id="-automate-things">🤖 Automate things</h2>
<p><strong>We are programmers; we naturally don’t like routine and doing repetitive tasks.</strong> If it happens to us twice or more, we are looking for ways to automate it.</p>
<p>Especially in finance, this can be important. For example, automatic tracking of your expenses is one thing that can lead to financial freedom; it can be used to reduce our spending by tracking our expenses to free more cash from your dev-salary monthly investment.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="-be-in-the-moment">🚀 Be in the moment</h2>
<p>Thinking about the past is pointless. Our whole life is ruining because we think much more about the past and future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can forget about the present.</p>
<p><strong>The “now” is more important than anything:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you can do now, rather than what you can do in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you have now and what you could do with the thing you have now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain.”―Louis Tomlinson</em></p>

<h2 id="-dont-swap-money-for-time">📊 Don’t swap money for time</h2>
<p>And also don’t overspend money on useless things. <strong>Because the more you spend, the more time you need to recover this resource.</strong></p>
<p>Our income is indeed limited by time. Basically, we trade in 8-10 hours/day for income and have to wait years before obtaining the necessary job promotion with a fair chance that we may not get that promotion.</p>
<p>That’s why it is necessary to stop swapping money for the time by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Changing your mindset around earning and spending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building an asset that scales (like a side project that will bring passive income)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your “passive” money  and savings to make you more money—start investing or growing your side hustle</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2 id="-ignore-distractions">⚡️ Ignore distractions</h2>
<p>We live in a modern world where it is incredibly easy to get distracted, for example, via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Such interruptions cost not only precious productive hours but also valuable effort and energy. Instead, <strong>invest your time in more important things that will make you closer to your goals and dreams.</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how to prevent distractions and sharpen your focus by reading the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324560">“7 Proven Strategies for Overcoming Distractions”</a> article.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-stop-letting-other-peoples-opinions-control-you">🤯 Stop letting other people’s opinions control you</h2>
<p>When you have to formulate your actions according to others, it actually wastes a lot of time too.</p>
<p>It can prevent you from doing the things you want to do or being who you truly are. Basically, you will tie yourself to the yo-yo of what other people think of you.</p>
<p><em>“The trouble is you think you have time.” – Buddha</em></p>
<p>You have better things to care about than the opinions of others on you because life gives us enough to deal with as is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Time is the most valuable asset you own. Once it is gone, it is gone.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p><strong>Invest your time into making yourself a more knowledgeable and smart person, working for something that will pay you off today or tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>Become a Pro at time management, stop undervaluing your time, stop swapping it actively for money, and instead start investing your time into a variety of assets, including yourself.</p>

<p>
Sometimes, all we really need is a big pile of logs 
</p>
</div>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Logging isn't cheap, so we often disable debug level logs (and lower) when we deploy our code to production. When things are going well, this isn't an issue. But when an error log pops up, much of the context around what was happening in the code is missing. A single line about the stack trace often just isn't enough. It'd be pretty nice to have a more detailed picture of what was happening at the time of failure. If only we had turned on those debug and trace logs.</p>
<p>Well, there's a reason we don't. Simply put, it's expensive. Often, there's an order of magnitude more debug and trace level logs than all other logging levels combined. So if we were to log it all, we'd have to spend multiples more.</p>
<p>We have to choose between a bad option and a worse option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't debug log and miss the crucial context when an error occurs</li>
<li>Log everything and pay up</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where most conversations around this end. Option 2 is a non-starter so we go option 1. If an error pops up we try to replicate the bug locally with debugging on and work from there.</p>
<h2>Using A Ring Buffer</h2>
<p>Luckily, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>. We have a third option. Use a ring buffer to store debug logs and flush it when an error occurs.</p>
<p>This technique is conceptually simple. It takes just a sentence to describe, and not much has changed about the way things are logged. We still use the same logging libraries and the same logging software patterns, but now we have access to far more information in our logs when things go wrong.</p>
<p>You can have your cake and eat it too. You can avoid logging verbosely while at the same time having access to those verbose logs when it matters.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Say that we're building a Django backend for our online widget store, and say that there's a bug somewhere in
the pseudo code below.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>handle_order_post_request</span><span>(</span>req<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  customer <span>=</span> get_customer<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>not</span> is_authorized_customer<span>(</span>customer<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> HttpStatusUnauthorized<span>(</span><span>)</span>

  orders <span>=</span> get_orders<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  verify_prices<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 
  verify_inventory<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 

  checkout_info <span>=</span> process_order<span>(</span>order<span>)</span>
  save_checkout<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> HttpStatusOk<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>


<span>def</span> <span>process_order</span><span>(</span>orders<span>:</span> List<span>[</span>OrderItems<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> CheckoutInfo<span>:</span>
  logger<span>.</span>debug<span>(</span><span>"total price: %d"</span><span>,</span> order<span>.</span>price<span>)</span>

  total_price <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>order<span>.</span>price <span>for</span> order <span>in</span> orders<span>]</span><span>)</span>

  most_expensive_item <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span>
    orders<span>,</span> key<span>=</span><span>lambda</span> order<span>:</span> order<span>.</span>price
  <span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> CheckoutInfo<span>(</span>
    total_price<span>,</span>
    most_expensive_item<span>,</span>
  <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We've launched our widget store, and it's a hit. The widgets our flying off the shelves. Things are going
great but every once in a while our backend errors and a would-be customer leaves our site unhappy.
Without ring buffer logging, here are the logs.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is null</code></pre></div>
<p>Something is going wrong, but what is it? with just a single line error it's difficult to tell what's going
wrong even if we had the stack trace. However, if we had all the contextual debug logs we'd have far more
useful information:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>DEBUG get_orders<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> number of orders: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_prices<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> prices changes: <span>1</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_inventory<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> items out of stock: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG total_price<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> total price: <span>0.0</span>
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is None</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we see a more full picture of the story. The transaction began by processing two orders from the customer. One
of the prices were updated, but both items were out of stock.</p>
<p>Aha! when items were out of stock, they were removed from the checkout meaning that there was no most expensive
item since the list was empty. Now we know what to do to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Now, this example isn't enough to tell you whether or not ring buffer logging is worth it for your codebase. I'm not going
to make an argument telling you what you should be doing when I have no context in what you deal with. But I definitely do
recommend playing around with it to see if it works for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-53">
	

	
	<div>
		
<p>In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Beginning of Infinity, (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359" target="_blank">The Beginning of Infinity,</a> David Deutsch proposes that the creation of knowledge encoded in genes is similar to the creation of knowledge by people. Knowledge creation involves two phases. It starts with mutations, changes or errors in the replication of the DNA sequence, which are similar to our creative leaps or conjectures. This resembles the creative or brainstorming phase. Next, via natural selection, mutations or variations are selected for in order to survive particular environments. This resembles the competitive or argumentative phase. It involves selection of specific ideas among all the conjectures we have come up with. Let’s call the first phase hypothesis generation (mutations/variations) and the second phase truth filtration (natural selection).</p>



<p>The first phase requires a high velocity of creative, surprising ideas. The second phase requires a careful, reasonable breakdown of these ideas. Contributions to the first phase involve creativity at best and fraud at worst. Contributions to the second phase involve thoroughness at best and pessimism at worst. We need both.</p>



<p>This essay talks about the first phase, where what matters is that which is surprising. A mutation is a mutation only if it is different from the original, expected sequence; in other words, a surprise. One of the ideas in information theory, which underlies modern computing, is that information is surprise. What disseminates through Twitter is what is surprising. You scroll through the mundane and pause at the surprising. Billion dollar start-ups were surprising ideas. Investments that generated high returns were surprising. If they weren’t surprising, other people would have started these companies or invested in these ideas and then they would not have had outlier outcomes. Economic growth is surprising because it primarily relies on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf" target="_blank">flow of new ideas</a>. Stand-up comedy that works is surprising. One of the theories on laughter is that we laugh when we are surprised. </p>



<p>All these also need to be “true” in some sense, but they have to be surprising to begin with because if they weren’t, they would be arbitraged away, either emotionally (e.g. Twitter, stand-up) or financially (e.g. start-ups, investing). We crave surprise, however, we want it in appropriate doses. Sociologist Murray Davis said in one of his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="papers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004839317100100211" target="_blank">papers</a> that if an idea questions one of your weakly held beliefs, you accept it as interesting. If it questions one of your strongly held beliefs, you dismiss it as insane. (I think that if an idea is completely new and doesn’t wrestle with any of your beliefs, you might not notice it.)</p>



<p>What helps the first phase, hypothesis generation, is typically different from what helps the second phase, truth filtration. Truth filtration comes from peer review, markets, experiments, and democracy. It requires criticism, devil’s advocacy, error correction, and honesty. On the other hand, hypothesis generation requires coddling, encouragement, and a suspension of belief. It requires an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a>-like “yes and” rather than “no but”. It tends to come from solitude or small groups (e.g. Einstein, Satoshi Nakomoto, start-ups) because most large groups devolve into devil’s advocacy.</p>



<p>We have many institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for truth filtration. We can instinctually argue the other side when someone shares an idea. Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News are all suited for truth filtration; users are quick to call out BS or offer counterarguments. Cunningham’s Law is a good articulation of this – “the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” Mutations are “wrong” in some sense and most will never be selected for, however, they need to be encouraged to reach their potential before weeding them out. So while society has a plethora of mechanisms in place for truth filtration, it has poor institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for hypothesis generation.</p>



<p>Some significant, especially new, ideas may begin as tentative hesitations. In Jony Ive’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="eulogy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGI76__sSA" target="_blank">eulogy</a> of Steve Jobs, he said, “He (Jobs) better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily squished.” Solitude is a good starting point, but discussions with people add creative value – they make your mind race in interesting directions. Improv is a good framework to think about what helps hypothesis generation. The key elements of improv are listening, trying to find ways to make an idea work, and being present. We should have a few institutions and emotional responses that help respond to a new hypothesis by assuming that this is our new reality and running with it. These ideas are like newborn babies; they are too young to be killed with criticism, even if that is honestly what we think about doing at that moment.</p>



<p>In the first phase, anyway, truth does not matter as much as surprise. Instead of, “why could this be wrong?” a good response would be, “in what worldview could this be right?”. This involves suspending your belief for a moment and, like an improv artist, uncompromisingly building on what the other person is thinking and feeling. It is a pure engagement with the idea without bringing in how many other people have tried it before and failed. It is a fantasy world in which this idea is new, original, and deserving of being explored to its fullest potential. You want the hypothesis generator to leave the discussion feeling energized and with a fuller version of her idea.</p>



<p>Improv isn’t about mere agreement. Many times, agreement is as boring as disagreement. When someone says A, the typical response is “yes, A!” or “not A!”. A better response would be “if A is true, then B” or “why A?” or “A adds to C, which this other person proposed”. Improv involves deeply empathizing with an idea, identifying its premise, and then taking that premise in an interesting direction. A good response to A can’t just be B if B is unrelated, but B is a good response if you use the premise in A to get to B. When someone proposes A, we often think that the purpose of the conversation is to decide between A and not A. But A can lead to B, C, D, E, and an infinite number of other options, so merely agreeing or disagreeing with something exploratory isn’t as interesting.</p>



<p>In practice, it may be difficult in some cases to separate hypothesis generation and truth filtration. The process of creating knowledge is fluid; we are making creative leaps as we are discovering what is true. However, there are ideas for which this is clearer. The improv approach is suitable for early, exploratory ideas; for example, “what if everything is priced in life years?” or “maybe we can replace cars with …”. It isn’t suitable for long-drawn, argumentative ideas like “abortion should be legal”, “free will doesn’t exist”, “Seinfeld is better than Friends”, “intelligence isn’t inherited”, etc.</p>



<p>What’s misleading about the phrase “truth filtration” is that while we might think that we are filtering for truth, sometimes we are not creative enough to understand that something is true. Stewart Brand put it well – “Reality is routinely stranger than fiction because reality has no obligation to sound plausible.” Also, sometimes we might just be focused on winning an argument instead of finding the truth. Winning an argument often involves disproving the other side’s weakest point, while finding the truth involves trying to disprove your strongest point. It would be nice to have a platform with the thoughtfulness of Hacker News but that thoughtfulness put to build on rather than reject exploratory ideas.</p>



<p>Hypothesis generation is important because without mutations or creative leaps, there would be nothing for evolution to select for. We need more institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses that encourage creative leaps; we need some version of improv for ideas.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Most overviews of register allocation are ridiculously complex and not at all practical. I hope, that by the end of this reading, you will gain a deeper understanding of the vocabulary and concepts that are often employed when discussing register allocation. Near the end, I’ll have a full-blown linear scan register allocator written in OCaml. If you want to follow along, you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Heasummn/ocaml_reg_alloc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-register-allocation">What is Register Allocation?<a href="#what-is-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I/O is slow. It is ridiculously slow. Reading from RAM takes about 50-100ns, reading from a register takes approximately 300ps. That is a difference of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. When you’ve got a program that requires every ounce of speed it can have, storing values in registers rather than RAM would result in a 1000x speedup. As compiler developers, it is our job to make sure that we are making full use of the registers available to us.</p><p>Register Allocation is a very interesting problem that arises in compiler development. How do we make the best use of registers while maintaining correctness?</p><h2 id="vocabulary-and-concepts">Vocabulary and Concepts<a href="#vocabulary-and-concepts" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>There are a ton of resources talking about register allocation out there, but a lot of them don’t stop and clarify the vocabulary that is being used. If you’re just looking for code samples, you can skip past this section.</p><h3 id="statement-ordering">Statement Ordering<a href="#statement-ordering" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Programs are trees, yet when talking about register allocation, we talk about the program as a sequence of statements. This is something that is often just glossed over and to be fair, it’s not very complex, but it’s not obvious either. We need some way of converting an AST into a sequence of statements that maintain dependencies. This is called a <strong>reverse postordering</strong> and is easily derived from a DFS. Most register allocation algorithms are applied per basic block, but can also be applied globally.</p><h3 id="liveness">Liveness<a href="#liveness" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>We say that a variable is <em>alive</em> if it is being used. We can represent this pretty easily using an array of start and endpoints, also known as <strong>live ranges</strong>. Register allocation becomes messy and a lot slower when using ranges, so instead we like to talk about just the start and endpoint of a variable’s life, also known as <strong>live intervals</strong>. We use liveness analysis when allocating registers, but it is also useful for type checking and some common optimizations, so computing the intervals is essentially “free”.</p><h3 id="spilling">Spilling<a href="#spilling" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Say we have 4 registers in our system and 5 variables that are alive at the same time. It is impossible to fit 5 gallons into a 4-gallon container, so we are out of luck. That won’t stop us though, we’re going to spill a variable. Spilling is the act of saving a variable into memory, rather than storing it in a register. To rephrase what we were saying earlier, we want a register allocation algorithm that minimizes unnecessary spilling. How do we choose which variable should be spilled though?</p><h3 id="heuristic">Heuristic<a href="#heuristic" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>There is no correct answer to the question we posed above. In a more positive tone, any answer is correct. We will choose something called a <strong>spilling heuristic</strong>, which is just how we decide which variable gets spilled. In linear scan register allocation, the algorithm that I’ll demonstrate in just a moment, the most common heuristic is to spill the variable that “dies” the latest.</p><h3 id="graph-coloring">Graph Coloring<a href="#graph-coloring" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Graph coloring is the problem of giving each vertex in a graph a different color (from some fixed set of colors) than any of its neighbors. This is not a “compiler problem”, but it was discovered that register allocation can be simplified to graph coloring. If we draw a graph with every single variable as a vertex and an edge between them if they are alive at the same time, we get a <strong>register inference graph</strong>, which we can then color with the registers available to us. The only problems are that some graphs cannot be colored and graph coloring is NP-complete and computationally expensive. There is a clever algorithm developed by <strong>Chaitin et al.</strong> that handles spilling in reasonable time. I will not be going over the algorithm, but send me a message if you’re interested.</p><h2 id="linear-scan-register-allocation">Linear Scan Register Allocation<a href="#linear-scan-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I promised code, let’s get to that code. From <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs132/linearscan.pdf" target="_blank">their 1999 paper</a> Poletto and Sarkar devised a ridiculously simple and clever algorithm for register allocation. We greedily assign and free registers until we can’t fit them in anymore, which is when we spill.</p><p>Linear scanning is ridiculously fast, but as you may have guessed, it does not produce optimal code. When <code>ocamlc</code> added an option for linear scanning, they saw compile-time improvements of almost 25%. The difference in performance between Chaitin’s algorithm and linear scanning is so minuscule that for a lot of applications it does not matter, but we like as much performance as we can have. Linear scanning is used most often in JITs, like Oracle’s Hotspot, because compilation speed matters a ton. This is the basic algorithm:</p><pre><code data-lang="none">LinearScanRegisterAllocation
    active ← {}
    for each live interval i, in order of increasing start point do
        ExpireOldIntervals(i)
        if length(active) = R then
            SpillAtInterval(i)
        else
            register[i] ← a register removed from pool of free registers
            add i to active, sorted by increasing end point

ExpireOldIntervals(i)
    for each interval j in active, in order of increasing end point do
        if endpoint[j] ≥ startpoint[i] then
            return
        remove j from active
        add register[j] to pool of free registers

SpillAtInterval(i)
    spill ← last interval in active
    if endpoint[spill] &gt; endpoint[i] then
        register[i] ← register[spill]
        location[spill] ← new stack location
        remove spill from active
        add i to active, sorted by increasing end point
    else
        location[i] ← new stack location
</code></pre><p>We enter the algorithm with all of the variables in our code represented as <em>live intervals</em>. In OCaml, we’ll define these to look like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>type</span> interval <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    reg<span>:</span> regs<span>;</span>

    end_point<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>regs</code> is just an enum containing all the registers that we have. To make life easier for us, let’s define a constructor:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> make_interval name start close <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span>
    name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>

    start_point <span>=</span> start<span>;</span>
    end_point <span>=</span> close<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To represent our input, we will use a global mutable array. I couldn’t figure out a way to make this completely immutable, but we’ll get pretty close. Once the algorithm is done, we’ll want to have the register or spilled status of each interval in the array.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> intervals <span>=</span> <span>[|</span>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people.

If you want to modify the product, you need to restart the entire process over again. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_633705"><div><h2><strong>Founders &amp; Market</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around a market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around key biology</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_651094"><div><p>In tech, a prototypical founder often worked at the incumbent company or realized a market opportunity by being that market themself. The insight around the market opportunity itself is a core value of the company. </p><p>In biotech, the insight of the founder is around a new or better way to develop a drug for the disease, or a discovery that was made in the laboratory (and the relevant patents around it). </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_665620"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often younger, ‘youth wunderkinds’ widely accepted <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often older due to scientific training or are a professional CEO, rarer to have very young founders </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_678110"><div><p>In tech, the 18-year-old drop-out is lauded and mystified. If anything, older founders may be subconsciously discriminated against in favor for younger founders. </p><p>In biotech, the prototypical founder is older, often a career CEO or exec coming out of a Big Pharma company. At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing. Once a new market is validated, other companies/copycats/fast-followers flow in. </p><p>In biotech, the market opportunities are diseases. New markets can somewhat be created (e.g., nootropics, elective medicines, Viagra) but generally speaking the markets are well known. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_423860"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are winner-take-all<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Many winners</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_458802"><div><p>In tech, investors often bet on a specific horse with the hope that the horse will win the race (and all the earnings). Bifurcated markets can be especially dangerous as companies compete on pricing and ‘race to the bottom’.</p><p>In biotech, the markets are <em>so </em>large, and the unmet need so high, that there can and often are many winners in one market (disease). The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug.

			<h2>On 15th July, Ben Arc published in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/an-open-letter-to-yanis-varoufakis-about-bitcoin">Bitcoin Magazine</a> an open letter addressed to me in a bid to convince me that I should re-assess my rejection of Bitcoin as a force for good; as a bulwark for democratising capitalism and paving the ground for socialism. Here is my reply:</h2>
<h3>Dear Ben Arc,</h3>
<h3>Thank you for your open letter and your efforts to bring a socialist perspective to bear upon my assessment of Bitcoin.</h3>
<h3>In my reply below, I shall address you as a fellow socialist, rather than put together a reply meant to address all sorts of different perspectives (e.g. Keynesian, Hayekian, neoclassical)</h3>
<h3>As you know, I am one of those who, back in 2011, were genuinely intrigued, fascinated even, by the remarkable blockchain algorithm. The prospect of a decentralised ledger controlled by its community of users was mesmerising.</h3>
<h3>As you also know, I was unimpressed by Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat money that is either likely, or indeed desirable, under our current capitalist predicament.</h3>
<h3>Having read your open letter, I remain as enthusiastic on blockchain’s capacities and as unimpressed by Bitcoin’s ability to help us either civilise or (as any socialist dreams of) transcend capitalism.</h3>
<h3>Two propositions support this view. In the hypothetical case where Bitcoin were, under presently-existing capitalism, to replace fiat money: (1) It would lack the mechanism necessary to stop capitalist crises from yielding depressions that benefit only the ultra-right; and, (2) Its community-based, democratic protocols would do little to democratise economic life.</h3>
<h3>I shall explain my two propositions briefly below. But, before you despair (at my continued negative take on Bitcoin), let me foreshadow the concluding sentence in the Epilogue below: Once (and, of course, if) socialism dawns, money will have to be founded on a distributed-ledger, monetary commons enabling tehnology.</h3>
<h3>In other words, I shall argue that Bitcoin is not fit for purpose under capitalism, or as a vehicle toward transcending capitalism, but something like Bitcoin will characterise monetary systems in a future world free of private banks and share markets.</h3>
<h3>OK, let me now support my two propositions:</h3>
<h2><strong><em>Proposition 1: Bitcoin lacks the shock absorbers necessary to prevent capitalist crises from doing untold damage to the working class</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Consider the Crash of 2008 or the more recent 2020 Covid-19-induced crisis. Suppose that Central Banks did not have the capacity instantly to create trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen – and instead had to rely on a spontaneous majority of Bitcoin’s users to agree to a massive increase in the supply of money. The result would be a 1929-like collapse of banks and corporations.</h3>
<h3>While socialists would shed no tears for the tragedy of the oligarchy, socialists should beware that a 1929-like systemic collapse is bound to strengthen the forces of the ultra-right – not of the socialist left (that has been, since at least 1991, languishing in the doldrums of political paralysis).</h3>
<h3>Technically, there is of course nothing that would prevent the Bitcoin community from agreeing instantly to even a doubling of the money base. However, the Tragedy of the Commons guarantees that Bitcoin owners will be subject to the usual prisoner’s dilemma dynamic that prevents the boost in the money supply necessary to avert the liquidation of potentially viable businesses and jobs. Moreover, this free-rider problem is made far, far worse by the fact that Bitcoin ownership is very unequally distributed, thus giving the Bitcoin-rich powerful incentives to restrain the growth of the money supply (since such restrictions would boost their private rents at the expense of the public interest).</h3>
<h3>In short, the free-rider problem that guarantees the maximal reinforcement of any capitalist crisis (in any economy relying on Bitcoin as its main currency) will be turbocharged by the unequal ownership of Bitcoin – which is unavoidable in any monetary system overlaid upon contemporary capitalism.</h3>
<h2><em>Proposition 2: Under capitalism, Bitcoin’s dominance will not democratise economic life – or give socialism a chance</em></h2>
<h3>Suppose, again, that some magic wand is waved and Bitcoin replaces fiat money under contemporary capitalist conditions. In other words, as Bitcoin replaced dollars, pounds, euros and yen, property rights over land, resources and machines remain as they are while private equity firms and pension funds continue to own the bulk of shares trading in Wall Street, the City etc. All that will have changed is that Central Banks will vanish and the community of Bitcoin users will determine the global money supply (subject to the free-rider problems mentioned above).</h3>
<h3>At the firm level, nothing will have changed. Jeff Bezos will still control a massive monopsony-cum-monopoly, Facebook will still own the whole marketplace within its platform, Exxon-Mobil will continue to lean on weaker developing country governments to drill for oil and gas that should be left in the Earth’s guts etc.</h3>
<h3>And what of private banks? They would, make no mistake here, find ways of creating complex derivatives based on Bitcoin – derivatives that will soon (just like Lehman Brothers’ CDOs prior to 2008) function as stores of value and means of exchange; i.e. as private money. Massive bubbles denominated in Bitcoin will build up and they will burst just as they did in the 19<sup>th</sup> century under the Gold Standard. And then?</h3>
<h3>In the absence of Central Banks and with the Bitcoin community in the clasps of the aforementioned free-rider problem, depression will follow – as it did before the Fed was instituted in the US. Thus, the tragedy mentioned in Proposition 1 above kicks in.</h3>
<h3>In short, not only will the democratisation of money via Bitcoin fail to democratise capitalism but it will also give an almighty boost to the forces of regression.</h3>

<h3>Bitcoin’s great appeal is that it breaks the cronyist chain linking central banks and private bankers. However, it does not undermine the cronyism of the network of bosses, politicians and private bankers.</h3>
<h3>Lest we forget, 19<sup>th</sup> Century bimetallic America also lacked a central bank. Under the gold and silver standards, the public money supply was fixed – and could not be easily manipulated by the state (either the government or the, then non-existent, Fed). But that did not stop private bankers from leveraging public money out of thin air to create huge quantities of private money with which to fund the Robber Barons, i.e. the Jeff Bezoses, of the era.</h3>
<h3>In this sense, replacing fiat money with Bitcoin would take us back to a postmodern version of 19<sup>th</sup> Century America – not exactly a prospect socialists should go to the barricades for.</h3>
<h3>In summary, the monetary system is like the dog’s tail. It cannot wag the capitalist dog, in the sense that democratising money by means of a monetary commons will not democratise economic life but, rather, make capitalism uglier, nastier and more dangerous for humanity.</h3>
<h3>Having said all this, a monetary commons (that may very well rely on something like the blockchain underpinning Bitcoin) will, I have no doubt, be an essential aspect of a democratised economy; of socialism.</h3>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o
<span># build the unsafe library to C with emcc</span>
<span>$ </span>emcc unsafe-lib.c          <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> unsafe-lib.wasm <span>-s</span> WASM2C <span>--no-entry</span>
<span># build the unsafe …</span></code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Docker desktop and minikube are popular options for local development.  Do you need both installed for local development or can you save some RAM and run a only one  of them.  Below are some questions to help you decide which one to use in your situation.</p>



<p><strong>Which version of Kubernetes are you running in production? </strong></p>



<p>Kuberenets (k8s) is on a three month release cycle with an N-2 support policy. For example in July 2020 k8s 1.18 is the most recent GA release, 1.17 and 1.16 are currently supported. When k8s 1.19 is released 1.16 will fall out of support. Many organizations run the oldest supported k8s to minimize risk to production systems.</p>

<p>Docker Desktop includes a hard coded version of Kubernetes. For example at time of writing the most recent Docker desktop includes k8s 1.16.5 since that is the oldest supported version of k8s. </p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="384" data-permalink="https://adibsaikali.com/docker-desktop-version/" data-orig-file="https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png" data-orig-size="1524,1022" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="docker-desktop-version" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=840" src="https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=1024" alt="" width="455" height="304" srcset="https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=453 453w, https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=907 907w, https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=150 150w, https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=300 300w, https://adibsaikali.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/docker-desktop-version.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 85vw, 455px"><figcaption>About dialog box on MacOS</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Currently it is not possible to change the version of k8s in Docker desktop. If you need an older version of k8s you will have to install an older version of Docker desktop.  Basically Docker is shipping  the  “most stable, widely used” version of k8s since many organizations run the oldest GA version of k8s in production.  </p>



<p> Minikube supports the most recent GA version of k8s plus the previous 6 minor versions.   You can pass minikube a command line argument to  launch a specific version of k8s. For example, <code>minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.18.3 </code>will launch k8s 1.18.3</p>



<p><strong>How do you build your container images?</strong></p>



<p>If you use a <code>Dockerfile</code> during development you will need to have Docker desktop installed, otherwise you won’t be able to run <code>docker build</code> to create a container image on your laptop. </p>



<p>If you are building your container image using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">JIB</a> that don’t require a local Docker daemon you can run minikube without Docker desktop.</p>



<p><strong>Do you need a local container registry?</strong></p>



<p>Minikube does not ship with a container registry. By default it will try to resolve container images from Docker hub and other public registries. If you need to build containers on your laptop and you want minikube to pull them form your laptop rather than a remote container registry you will benefit from running Docker desktop since it includes a local container registry. </p>



<p><strong>How do you manage local development dependencies? </strong></p>



<p>If your application depends on commonly used OSS databases, message queues, caches you will have to decide how setup these dependencies on your laptop. There are three reasonable choices. </p>



<ul><li>Install on laptop </li><li>Run with docker-compose</li><li>Run on minikube </li></ul>



<p>Installing directly on a laptop can be time consuming and error prone. If you work on multiple apps or services that need different versions of PostgreSQL or MySQL then development becomes more time consuming and error prone.</p>



<p>You can run dependencies using docker-compose  which has a nice developer friendly workflow. </p>



<ul><li>checkout code </li><li><code>docker-compose up</code></li><li>write code / run tests on laptop that use services running in Docker</li><li><code>docker-compose down</code></li></ul>



<p>With docker-compose we are running third party dependencies in simple repeatable manner. </p>



<p>Minikube can also be used to run third party dependencies such as MySQL and other tools. To do so you will have to write k8s deployment manifests and expose the services using a NodePort on the minikube vm ip address. </p>



<p>If you want to use docker-compose for dependencies then you will need docker desktop, otherwise you can get away with minikube. </p>



<p><strong>Are you using JUNIT with test containers ?</strong></p>



<p>If you are using the <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">test containers</a> project for your automated testing you will need to  run Docker Desktop since test containers does not currently support Kubernetes. </p>



<p><strong>Which Operating System are you using for local development?</strong></p>



<p>Docker Desktop is available on MacOS and Windows  and it includes both k8s and docker . On Linux the docker distribution only includes docker, so you will have to  install  k8s from another source.</p>



<p>Minikube is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  If  you are looking for the same developer experience across Mac, Windows, and Linux then minikube is a good choice. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Use docker desktop if  </p>



<ul><li>You need to build  container images from <code>Dockerfile</code></li><li>You need a local container registry</li><li>You are managing your local development environment with docker compose</li><li>You are using test containers with junit</li><li>The version of Kubernetes included in docker desktop is the version  you want to use</li><li>Your developers are only on MacOS and Windows.</li></ul>



<p>Use minikube if</p>



<ul><li>You need to pick a specific version of Kubernetes to work with </li><li>You don’t need a local container registry</li><li>You are not using test containers with junit</li><li>You have developers using Linux, MacOS, and Windows</li></ul>



<p>Based on your answers to the question above it is quite possible that you will need to run both. </p>

<p><em>Be kind to your future self. If</em><em> you feel stuck, the best thing you can possibly do for future “you” is to make time to reinvent present “you.”</em></p>



<p>Six months ago, I was totally out of answers.</p>



<p>It was a chilly, dreary January day in Denver, Colorado. I had just left my job at a marketing company back home in Philadelphia, and I had no idea what I was going to do next. My only instinct, the day I left the office for good, was to book a flight for a short getaway to the Mile-High City, one of my favorite places to visit. I needed that space. I needed that clarity of mind. I was sick and tired of striking out in my search for meaningful work, and I didn’t know where else to look. </p>



<p>Just three years prior, I made the decision to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">leave another unfulfilling office job to carve my own path</a>. At the time, I knew it was a huge risk, but it was something I knew I needed to do to have any chance of realizing my full potential. But on this cold and lonely day in Denver, it felt like Groundhog Day all over again. Walking down a quiet street in the city’s North Capitol Hill section, I saw my reflection in a café window. I saw no change.</p>



<p>In three years, I went from depressed office worker to world-traveler, to excited entrepreneur, to the pinnacle of the restaurant industry, and back to depressed office worker. Had I just spent those years chasing my tail? What had I accomplished besides coming full circle to yet another desk job?</p>



<p>If this was my master plan to reinvent myself and carve my own path, I was failing miserably. The problem was that I was relying too much on other people for opportunities to determine my future. The bigger problem was that I never gave myself the time to do it for myself.</p>







<h3><strong>The Missing Link</strong></h3>



<p>Running a restaurant for two of those three years since escaping the cubicle had left me with little time to even think, let alone sleep and shower. My family suffered for it. My girlfriend suffered for it. And my potential for the personal growth and freedom I so yearned for suffered for it.</p>



<p>While walking along the Pearl Street Mall in Denver, I did a quick mental calculation. There are only 24 hours in a day. No matter if you are just scraping by, or if you are Bill Gates, we all have the same amount of this most valuable asset—<em>time</em>. You spend a third of that time sleeping. When you account for the time spent eating, showering, driving, working, etc., you are left with a measly 2-3 hours. And that’s at best. With those remaining hours, you just want to spend it relaxing on the couch, unwinding from the day. When do you find time to reinvent yourself? How can you meaningfully change course from an unfulfilling path that is sucking up all of your time?</p>



<p>Sure, if you want to grind straight through each day, you are free to do that. While there are some mutants out there who have been successful using this method, it does not work for most of us. You simply cannot rely on willpower alone to build anything of quality and value in the long run. You have to get smart and build a reliable system that creates time and cultivates curiosity. On that day in Denver, I decided I needed to find more time to reinvent myself.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Find More Time</strong></h3>



<p>Coincidentally, Covid-19 took the world by storm shortly after I returned to Philadelphia. Was it a sign from the heavens that I was waiting for? Was it just a coincidence that I needed to recognize and take full advantage of? Whatever it was, it virtually cleared out months of time for me to reinvent myself. So I moved up to a cabin in the Pocono Mountains and got to work.</p>



<p>Even with the pandemic keeping many of us home, finding time still is a big problem. Working from home, handling kids, making dinner, handling the endless chores around the house, and making time to get outside to avoid cabin fever are among the responsibilities for those of us lucky enough to be working from home. Whether you are working from home, working on site, or simply looking for a better system for reinventing your life, I have a four-step, actionable process that will ensure your ability to pivot from an unfulfilling path.</p>



<h4><strong>Step One: Commit</strong></h4>



<p><em>“The difference between involvement and commitment is like ham and eggs. The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>– Martina Navratilova</p>



<p>The most important step of this entire equation is to commit to yourself. You must commit to making the change you so deeply desire. If not, then the rest of this process falls apart.</p>



<p>Just looking at yourself in the mirror and hoping for a change won’t do it. Looking at the Kardashians and wanting their life won’t do it. Chasing the highest paying job you can find won’t do it. Extrinsic motivation never works in the long run if you want to make meaningful change in your life.</p>



<p>You must have an intrinsic, in-your-blood, raging-fire type motivation. Everyone has it. Everyone has that “something” that gets them out of bed in the morning. It just depends on how much the fire has been dulled by years of unsatisfying work and sub-optimal habits.</p>



<p>For me, my intrinsic motivation is family. To reinvent myself is something I needed to do for my family (and a family of my own in the future). I never want to look at my reflection in another café window to see the same underachieving person. I needed to be better for myself and for my family. That is my driving force.</p>



<p>You could also use the <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/11/12-favorite-problems/">12 Favorite Problems</a> approach. There is no best approach to finding your purpose, but when I am out of answers, this method cuts straight through to the source.</p>



<p>Find that force in your own life—your “<em>why</em>.” Commit to reinvent yourself on a foundation of intrinsic motivation. Make it urgent, because you never know when your time on earth will be up. This is not a process for improving your life. This is a way of actively saving it.</p>



<h4><strong>Step Two: Simplify</strong></h4>



<p>Once you make this commitment to saving your life, you must take steps from the outset to clear a path. </p>



<p>Most of us, and I am surely in this group, can be hindered by clutter. Physical clutter, mental clutter, digital clutter, time clutter. All of this, whether conscious or not, serves to slow us down and overwhelm us.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Physical Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>I started by <strong>cleaning my work area</strong>. Getting rid of unnecessary papers, trash, and even objects that didn’t contribute to the look and feel of my work environment. Keeping only the necessary items in the physical spaces where I spend most of my time has made a world of difference. As I always say:</p>



<p><em>External Mess = Internal Stress</em></p>



<p>Don’t underestimate the power of your physical environment. Build a place that you are comfortable in, that motivates you, that facilitates calmness and thoughtfulness, that inspires you to do your best meaningful work. You will instantly become more efficient with your time.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Mental Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>This is possibly the toughest area to declutter. The mind is so complex, so unpredictable, and so ever-present that it is hard to even know where to start. </p>



<p>Pick one area that brings you the most stress. I started with quitting the news.</p>



<ul><li>By <strong>not watching the news</strong>, I have seen a drastic improvement in my metal state. It is a classic example of addition by subtraction. If a piece of news is important enough, it will find its way to me. But I’ll pass on being depressed by the never-ending stream of crime and politics.</li><li>Along the same lines, <strong>read less junk</strong>. Scrolling Buzzfeed and your Facebook timeline endlessly will do nothing but make you jealous and lethargic. Clear that head-space, and clear that time off your calendar for more useful activities that will get you on the path to achieving your goal.</li><li><strong>Meditate</strong>, or just simply give your mind some time to breathe. Constantly crowding it with unnecessary and stressful inputs will drain your ability and your inspiration for self-reinvention.</li></ul>



<h5><strong><em>Digital Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<ul><li><strong>Clean out your inbox</strong>. Better yet, schedule a time each week for “inbox-zero.” For me, that is every Sunday night. Being able to accomplish that goal before the new week is often the springboard I need to get off to an productive start.</li><li><strong>Clear your desktop on your computer</strong>. Create folders, label properly, and commit to maintaining your filing system. Clutter on your screen will lead to more feelings of overwhelm and ineffectiveness.</li><li><strong>Cut down on TV</strong>. You may be in the habit of watching Netflix with your loved ones when you have some free time. But turning off the TV and doing more interactive things with your family and friends can give you a boost in creativity and productivity that you wouldn’t normally get from passive screen time. Less TV is bound to free up a couple more hours per week.</li></ul>



<p>There are so many more ways to declutter your digital life. These are the three that have helped me the most.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Time Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>In our daily lives, we tend not to organize our time in the way we organize tangible areas like our desks, our homes, and our computers. Due to the invisibility of time, we often let our days become cluttered with insidious, time-sucking activities that will inevitably crowd out productive time each day. To fend off this type of clutter:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Block out time on your calendar for productive work</strong>. By scheduling your week ahead of time, you can visually account for where your time will go. I simply use the calendar on Microsoft Outlook. Many people use Notion or write it down by hand. It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you make an effort to document it.</li><li><strong>Cut down on meetings</strong>. If someone needs to meet in person, see if a phone call will do. If they want to talk on the phone, see if an email will do. If they want to reach out over email, see if a text message will do. Be ruthless, yet respectful.</li><li><strong>Simplify …</strong></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div>
						<p>Online communities often grow from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grouped-groups-friends-influence-social/dp/0321804112?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">small, enthusiastic, intelligent niche group</a> that is relatively self-policing to a larger, amorphous group that becomes stupider at a rate that’s an exponent of the number of users (the linked book is excellent on this topic). Initial moderators are usually enthusiasts and small groups are more like communities than cities. Later moderators, though, are usually adversely selected: What kind of person would voluntarily spend lots of time and energy policing a community for no money? Consequently, online community decline is often exacerbated by the moderator or moderators who eventually take over or seek power.</p>
<p>The psychology of someone who is willing to moderate a Reddit subsection—or any similar site, like many mailing lists—is not good. This sort of person is willing to spend a time at a thankless task that is hard to do well and rarely if ever remunerative.</p>
<p>Those who start at that task do so optimistically but often quit as their lives change or the task becomes more onerous. Who gets left? People with axes to grind; people with no sense of perspective; petty tyrants; and so on. I don’t use Reddit much for many reasons, but low moderator quality is one. I rarely bother messaging them because doing so is largely a waste of time.</p>
<p>The problem with moderators is not dissimilar from the problem of users: People who regularly have something interesting to say and the means to say it well get blogs, as I wrote in “<a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2013/06/05/social-news-sites-and-forums-should-encourage-users-to-blog/">Social news sites and forums should encourage users to blog</a>.” Those who don’t stay on Reddit. The average Reddit contributor has little stake in long-term reputation—unlike bloggers, journalists, and academics who use real names—and that shows in the quality and quantity of posts. That may not hurt the site—the popularity of bad TV shows over many years demonstrates lowest-common denominator issues—but it should hurt in terms of high-quality users.</p>
<p>A form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s Law</a> applies to social sites and to moderators: bad commentary pushes out the good, and smart people flee stupid comments. One could alternately call this a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Tragedy_of_the_commons.html">tragedy of the commons</a>, in which communal spaces become overrun with spam or commentary so stupid that it might as well be spam.</p>
<p>Reddit and similar sites can have an orthogonal problem, however, as they become so afraid of self-interested commentary or posts that they forbid it—thus causing smart people to go elsewhere with their thoughts, and leaving the dregs unwilling or able to create standalone communities or blogs.</p>
<p>This may be part of the reason why Reddit—even on the “good” subsections—tend to be better for beginners: anyone who gets past the beginning stages needs more expert advice than Redditors can provide. The same is happening to Hacker News, too, or it has already happened, though not as severely: Hacker News has an advantage in that its survival and the intelligent commentary on it is tied to a business that is in turn tied to ideas. Its moderators have a stronger incentive to get it right, since they’re not driven primarily by ego or overwhelming fear of “spam.”</p>
<p>That being said, anyone who has seen an unmoderated forum is aware of the fact that unmoderated forums are unusable. So getting rid of moderators is not a solution. In general the mechanisms of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604;ref">exit, voice, and loyalty</a>, as described by Hirshman at the link, apply on the level of online communities. But constantly shifting for newer communities where smart people congregate is at best difficult and at worst a waste of time in and of itself. Reddit has to some extent worked on this problem through the sub-Reddit system, which is a better-than-nothing solution but not a great one.</p>
<p>Maybe there is no good solution to this from the perspective of smart users other than withdrawal. Better blogs written by smart individuals or groups are better than virtually any online, Reddit-like community I’ve found. Which is too bad. But I doubt most people in latter-day moderator positions are even willing or able to read this post, and, if they are, I don’t think they’ll understand it, and, if they do, I don’t think they’ll accept any of it.</p>

<article>
    <p>TL;DR
<a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown with Confluence</a></p>

<p>Oh man, I was so frustrated when I was trying to edit docs in Confluence, and it
broke all my text, trying to adjust any tags led to breaking the text even more.
I felt the same when Slack introduced their Wysiwyg editor that solved problems that never existed,
but at least they added an option to disable it.</p>
<p>Wysiwyg is the Devil’s Playground, but there is a solution.</p>
<p>Store with Git, write in Markdown, automatically sync with Confluence. Interesting? Let me tell you
about seven benefits that you could have if you could use Git for storing your docs instead of editing
them directly in Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Git</strong><br>
Confluence has a history of changes, but it’s very limited: you can’t do <code>git blame</code>,
you can’t do <code>git log -S</code> to search who added a specific text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull Requests</strong><br>
Now, someone with a fresh set of eyes can identify problems and provide suggestions for docs.
You write code — someone reviews it, you write a book — someone reviews it.
Now, you write docs — someone reviews it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instruments</strong><br>
We have some great tools like VSCode, Neovim, Sublime, or Idea with all required set of
extensions that make our coding even more efficient and less frustrating.</p>
<p>Then why not using it for writing docs? It’s more efficient than Wysiwyg for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No context switching</strong><br>
No need to jump around to read docs a bit. Just open it up in your editor
because you store the docs near to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hosting Agnostic</strong><br>
You can just push your docs on GitHub if you want to open source it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decentralization</strong><br>
Everyone has their own complete copy of docs, develops it, and syncs up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong><br>
If you have a proper tool that I’m going to introduce, you can automatically update your docs in
Confluence after a successful <code>git push</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown documentation with Atlassian Confluence</a></p>
<p>Mark reads your Markdown file, creates a Confluence page if it doesn’t, uploads
attachments if any, translates Markdown into HTML, and updates the contents of the page via REST API.</p>
<p>It’s like you don’t even need to create sections/pages in your Confluence anymore, just mention them in
your .md files.</p>
<p>Mark uses an extended file format, which, still being valid markdown, contains several HTML-ish
metadata headers, which can be used to locate page inside Confluence instance and update it
accordingly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown"><span>&lt;!-- Space: &lt;space key&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: &lt;parent 1&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: &lt;parent 2&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Title: &lt;title&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: &lt;local path 1&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: &lt;local path 2&gt; --&gt;</span>

Some text here.
</code></pre></div><h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><code>mark.md</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown"><span>&lt;!-- Space: DEV --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: Automation --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: Documentation --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Title: Sync Markdown to Confluence --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: images/screenshot.png --&gt;</span>

Article text here.
![<span>screenshot</span>](<span>images/architecture.png</span>)
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mark -u user -p password -b http://confluence/ -f mark.md
</code></pre></div><p>Mark will upload file <code>images/screenshot.png</code> as an attachment, create a page in Confluence by the
following path:<br>
<code>Dev / Automation / Documentation → Sync Markdown to Confluence</code>, then render
Markdown as HTML and put the contents via REST API on the user’s behalf.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>It’s quite trivial to integrate Mark into a CI/CD system, here is an example with <a href="https://snake-ci.com/">Snake CI</a>
in case of self-hosted Bitbucket Server / Data Center.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>stages</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- sync<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>Sync documentation</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>stage</span><span>:</span><span> </span>sync<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>only</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>branches</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>- main<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span>kovetskiy/mark<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- for<span> </span>file<span> </span>in<span> </span>$(find<span> </span>-type<span> </span>f<span> </span>-name<span> </span><span>'*.md'</span>);<span> </span>do<span>
</span><span>        </span>echo<span> </span><span>"&gt; Sync $file"</span>;<span>
</span><span>        </span>mark<span> </span>-u<span> </span>$MARK_USER<span> </span>-p<span> </span>$MARK_PASS<span> </span>-b<span> </span>$MARK_URL<span> </span>-f<span> </span>$file<span> </span>||<span> </span>exit<span> </span><span>1</span>;<span>
</span><span>        </span>echo;<span>
</span><span>      </span>done<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, I’m using the <code>kovetskiy/mark</code> image for creating a job container where the
repository with documentation will be cloned to. The following command finds all <code>*.md</code> files and runs mark against them one by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>for</span> file in <span>$(</span>find -type f -name <span>'*.md'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; Sync </span><span>$file</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    mark -u <span>$MARK_USER</span> -p <span>$MARK_PASS</span> -b <span>$MARK_URL</span> -f <span>$file</span> <span>||</span> <span>exit</span> 1<span>;</span>
    echo<span>;</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The following directive tells the CI to run this particular job only if the changes are pushed into the
<code>main</code> branch. It means you can safely push your changes into feature branches without being afraid
that they automatically shown in Confluence, then go through the reviewal process and automatically
deploy them when PR got merged.</p>

Out of all the new things that came along with the release, one feature that stood apart was <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/machine-learning/ml-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapML</a>.</p><p id="2991">SnapML allows lens creators to use their own custom machine learning models inside filters. Snapchat filters already use ML for a variety of things like face tracking, surface tracking, segmentation, facial gestures, and more.</p><p id="fef5">But with SnapML, developers can now go beyond those limits, using the breadth of their imaginations to combine custom ML models with Snapchat’s feature-rich augmented reality tools—and an audience of millions!</p><p id="49e5">Snapchat has made a lot of initial efforts to make the experience of implementing ML models as smooth and straightforward as possible. To do this, they’ve provided several ready-to-use templates that could be turned into AR experiences in only a few minutes. Let’s explore these templates and learn how to use them to create filters.</p><p id="a0a1">There are 5 main Lens Studio templates provided by Snap that cover some of the most common mobile machine learning tasks. We’ll cover the ML side of things a bit later, but first, here’s a look at the template projects inside Lens Studio:</p><h2 id="880d"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Style Transfer</strong></a></h2><p id="a9ab"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Style transfer</a> is used to modify the overall visual appearance of the camera texture. Essentially, this task allows us to recompose the content of one image in the style of another.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="cc30">This could be used to create unique artistic styles or color filters. Imagine a selfie in the style of your favorite visual artists. This is similar to what we see in many image and video editing apps like <a href="https://prisma-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prisma</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looq-photo-video-filters/id1159704664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looq</a>.</p><p id="f688">This project template contains an example ML model with a style transfer visual effect. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom style transfer model.</p><h2 id="4439"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/classification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Classification</strong></a></h2><p id="5517">This template uses the <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image classification</a> ML technique, which is used to classify images into different labels. This task is also sometimes referred to as image labeling or image recognition.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg" width="500" height="250" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1a92">This could be used to tell, for example, whether user is wearing a hat or not in a given image or video frame. However, to create this kind of model, you’ll need to train it on a large dataset. There’s a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=image+classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide variety of image classification datasets out there</a>, but if there’s no dataset available for your use case, you’ll need to collect and label one.</p><p id="0e08">This template contains an example ML model that can tell if the user is wearing glasses or not, showing a particle effect if true. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom image classification model.</p><h2 id="f5e1"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Object Detection</strong></a></h2><p id="6f56">The <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object detection</a> template could be used to identify and locate one or more target objects in a given image or video frame. Object detection is somewhat similar to image classification, but it’s important to quickly distinguish the two:</p><ul><li id="138a">Image classification assigns a label to an image. A picture of a dog receives the label “dog”. A picture of two dogs, still receives the label “dog”</li><li id="d8b8">Object detection, on the other hand, draws what’s called a bounding box around each dog and labels the box “dog”. The model predicts where each object is and what label should be applied. In that way, object detection provides more information about an image than recognition.</li></ul><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg 400w" sizes="400px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="baea">In Lens Studio, you could use this template to identify the location of the ring finger in an image or video frame, and use that prediction to place an AR ring for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/mobile-machine-learning-in-e-commerce-and-retail-visual-search-ebook-sample-f6bfbd49e36c">virtual product try-ons</a>.</p><p id="8adb">Again, here you’ll need a large dataset of objects you want to detect—and their bounding box coordinates—to create a custom model for this effect. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=object+detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some available datasets</a> to consider working with.</p><p id="f6ed">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes cars from the COCO dataset and draws bounding boxes around them. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom object detection model.</p><h2 id="6786"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/custom-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Custom Segmentation</strong></a></h2><p id="30fd"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segmentation</a> is an ML technique used to differentiate between the specific parts or elements of an image. Specifically, it works at a pixel-level—the goal is to assign each pixel in an image to the object to which it belongs (i.e. class label).</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="c28d">Segmentation could be used to add effects to a given segmented region. Snap Lense already had built-in segmentation to separate the user from the background, but with custom ML models you extend this task to anything you can think of—for example, segmenting the sky and changing it to into a beautiful, sunset-like pink-orange color.</p><p id="003c">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes a pizza and adds a sizzling effect to it. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom segmentation model.</p><h2 id="9286"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ground-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ground Segmentation</strong></a></h2><p id="164d">Very similar to the above template, but this one is designed to segment the ground and floor surfaces and can be used to change the ground to anything you’d like—i.e. hot lava, a frozen tundra, etc</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif" width="300" height="534" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/600/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif 300w" sizes="300px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/34/0*OA5YaEqCcC_Qlkta.gif?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ground-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Snap’s Ground Segmentation template</a></figcaption></figure><p id="e5a8">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes the ground and masks it with a frozen ice texture, as seen above.</p><h2 id="7490"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ml-templates-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Third-Party Templates</a></h2><p id="8d81">Apart from these 5 ready-to-use templates from the Snap team, Snapchat and a few third-party creators have partnered to provide some more templates that could be used as a starting point for your effects, or could give you ideas and serve as inspiration for building your own custom models with SnapML!</p><p id="c128"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/ml-templates-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let us take a look</a> at what they offer:</p><ul><li id="0e2e"><strong>Foot Tracking by Wannaby - </strong>Using this template you could attach 3D or 2D objects to the feet. You can also detect their location on the screen and when the feet touch each other.</li><li id="5738"><strong>Multi-Segmentation- </strong>whats’s better than segmentation? Multi-segmentation, this template allows you to segment more than 1 region on the image and add your texture/effect mask on it</li><li id="d06b"><strong>Eyebrow Addition/Removal- </strong>as the name suggests you could remove the user’s eyebrow or add a new silly one using this template</li><li id="aa79"><strong>Face Mask Classification and Segmentation- </strong>this template is super useful in context with the COVID-19 pandemic situation where wearing a face mask has become essential for safety. This template could detect if the user is wearing a face mask and will allow you to give the mask a custom style and texture.</li><li id="23a1"><strong>Beard Addition/Removal- </strong>just like the eyebrow template, this one will allow you to remove a person’s beard or add a new virtual one</li></ul><p id="6e46">All of the above Lens Studio templates include not just a pre-configured project in Lens Studio, but also resources for actually creating and implementing the specific ML Components (Lens Studio’s word for model files) in the given project.</p><p id="8510">To do this, Snap has provided <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter Notebooks</a> for each template that could be imported directly into <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Colab</a>. As such, they can all be tweaked easily to create a variety of effects—but if you're trying to create something unique and more specific, you’ll need to train your own custom machine learning model.</p><p id="590e">These Notebooks contain model training code and step-by-step instructions to create custom ML models for your own dataset.

<p>I was trying to optimize a bash script and wondered how much echo statements would slow it down, so I did a few tests. I was specifically wondering if adding a check for verbosity before an echo statement would have a significant affect on runtime, vs just removing the echo statement all together.</p>

<p>I used this script to run the benchmark:

<p>I set <code>echo</code> to <code>01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789</code> when benchmarking for long echo statements, and to <code>foo</code> when benchmarking short echo statements.</p>

<p>The different options had significant differences in runtime. Checking for verbosity and not printing took an average of <code>1.5 - 1.7</code> times as long as not printing anything at all! I definitely took this into consideration when deciding which echo statements were really necessary for my bash script.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this benchmark is based on <code>echoing</code> to a file. By echoing to the console the options that print would take significantly longer.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any comments below!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h4><strong>Want to see some tried and tested color schemes?</strong> </h4><p>Here are the most popular websites by search traffic in the US for 2020 so far. We've pulled out the most dominant colors they use in their user interface. This is a result of their design teams iterating over time learning how to make the ideal experience for their users. A fun thing I love to do is browse through a website in the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to see the iterations to their web design over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>With no further ado, let's dive in.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. youtube.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,625,928,544</em></p><p>First up, we have YouTube. As the classic example of a user generated community, their use of a monochromatic color scheme allows their user content to stand out while the rest of the site's buttons dial back the stylistic features like extra chrome, button lines etc. The color red is used sparingly throughout the site experience to make their brand presence.</p><figure id="w-node-dd30d522abdd-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f0f3f346a77c079f50c_Youtube.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. en.wikipedia.org</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,032,257,682</em></p><p>Next, we have Wikipedia, our collective human hive mind. The most important UI here is the blue link that is the connective UI between all the pages. Our branched experience is guided by the contrast of the black and blue text. The subtle pastel colors are used to identify different types of information on a page.</p><figure id="w-node-f3e9626686b1-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f1c2797441bbf314858_Wikipedia.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. twitter.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 535,672,329</em></p><p>Twitter's web design has changed a lot over the years. The 2020 design has minimalized to a simple color scheme that consists of a dominant blue used for main call to actions, and a beautiful set of bluish grays to create a hierarchy of text styles.</p><figure id="w-node-57f2c70343ff-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f26091a846f51452e16_Twitter.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. facebook.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 512,517,207</em></p><p>Compared to Twitter, Facebook's color scheme is a bit more complex. It involves many more notifications and vibrant colors taking you from one corner of the UI to the next. It's surprising that Facebook hasn't mimicked more of Youtube's philosophy especially since they too rely on a lot of photography and user generated content.</p><figure id="w-node-d68aa9f10aad-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f313f346a777379f62c_Facebook.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>5. amazon.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 492,468,801</em></p><p>Amazon's web design is heavily anchored by the dark navigation bar with the search box. Since their shopping experience relies on intent to buy, reminding shoppers where to search and how accessible it is is very important for them. Light blues and yellows are used to accent the large boxes of white and bring attention to prime branding and other special deals.</p><figure id="w-node-f1131ed9d6fa-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f3f2a3bf07561ef0472_Amazon.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>6. yelp.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 189,284,057</em></p><p>Yelp's design is similar to Youtube. The wide use of whitespace makes way for the vibrant reds and blues to get the visitor's attention.</p><figure id="w-node-06063004e617-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f477532a80b1402e7de_Yelp.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. reddit.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 184,283,420</em></p><p>Reddit is a special one on this list. Since the value of Reddit is that anyone can customize a subreddit to their audience's liking, there is no universal color scheme for Reddit. On the homepage, it resorts to using bluish light grays and white to mark the community board layout.</p><figure id="w-node-bb013a4696fe-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f509fc4fe62dde19dcc_Reddit.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>8. imdb.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 168,686,113</em></p><p>Much like Amazon, IMDB relies on the search for its core experience. A darker color scheme is used all around the website to remind users of the movie going experience. Movie pages have a lighter appearance to give more attention to the blue text links and images.</p><figure id="w-node-af213f7b67ec-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f609508d3d4ce412e39_IMDB.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. fandom.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 168,358,254</em></p><p>Of all the websites on this list, Fandom definitely wins the title for most unique set of colors. While teal feels like the brand's most dominant color, the darker teals and bright neon green does a great job in supporting the composition.</p><figure id="w-node-2e0cffbe6628-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f6ad8a527e60c7b240d_Fandom.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. pinterest.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 160,008,934</em></p><p>Such a friendly set of colors. Although their user interface sets the expectation for a minimal set of colors like YouTube, they seem to be using muted versions of green, blue and yellow to give the website a splash of vibrancy,</p><figure id="w-node-3df77482884d-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f7347b1322743ea9d15_Pinterest.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. tripadvisor.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 107,547,225</em></p><p>Tripadvisor uses the very unique set of light neon colors, marking them separately from the other travel websites. Although the colors by itself can feel jarring in how bright it is, when paired together, the combination seems to work. To balance the eccentric color scheme, the color black is used for the input elements like textboxes and buttons.</p><figure id="w-node-9c75faa2153f-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f7a915325c29b2bcbf8_Tripadvisor.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>12. instagram.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 95,560,034</em></p><p>Instagram takes a page out of YouTube's brand color scheme. To highlight the photographs taken by Instagram users, the user interface uses black and white elements to blend it into the background. The primary colors like blue is reserved for buttons and the range of yellow to pink for their popular stories feature.</p><figure id="w-node-a3e998655c01-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f8366a20f0036a1f59c_Instagram.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>13. walmart.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 94,951,789</em></p><p>As opposed to Amazon, Walmart uses bold colors to highlight specials in a carousel layout. This prioritizes the curated products over the grid on the homepage. Accent colors of yellow is used for the call to action buttons.</p><figure id="w-node-e4385e966679-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f8cbb7b0af4d8921296_Walmart.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>14. craigslist.org<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 86,673,328</em></p><p>Oh the Craigstlist design that everyone loves to hate on. No matter what your opinion is, you have to admit it is very iconic. On a large canvas of white and light gray, a saturated blue is used for links. Orange and light yellow is used to highlight something new in the interface.</p><figure id="w-node-e03387aa1086-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f9766a20f1af5a1f5af_Craigslist.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>15. ebay.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 85,427,056<br></em></p><p>My eyes! Ebay sure does love a very bright set of colors. The large splashes of neon on the website directs your eyes to the different product categories of the marketplace. While YouTube wants to blend its web design to the background, Ebay directs your attention all around the webpage.</p><figure id="w-node-264183a05224-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f9ea9634b00e32ea12a_Ebay.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>16. linkedin.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 71,106,847</em></p><p>For a workplace social network like Linkedin, their color scheme comes across as serious and professional. By using muted tones of gray with darker and less saturated blues, it feels like the suit and tie of color schemes!</p><figure id="w-node-32de9ac32a5f-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5fa5a9634b1d462ea12c_Linkedin.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>17. play.google.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 68,140,558</em></p><p>Tons of color here! The Google Play store clearly wants attention to be directed to the different categories of things you can buy. The design language of YouTube has been translated here as well. With the use of a monochromatic color scheme, the buttons use a shade of gray while the colors are used as guides.</p><figure id="w-node-ea8bc5f1f494-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5fac9508d3120b412e43_Google%20Play.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>18. healthline.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 65,456,494</em></p><p>Healthline is able to make a serious topic like health into a fun and personal experience with their use of color. By apply a fresh tint of teal and fuchsia, they were able to give the visuals on the site a vibrant energy. As a design tip, using rounded corners also makes the layout feel more friendly.</p><figure id="w-node-24844d5b85bf-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5fb661f0a6242b044377_Healthline.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>19. etsy.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 59,552,312</em></p><p>We're starting to see patterns in community sites now. Much like Youtube, Instagram and Pinterest, Etsy uses a bright orange to highlight main areas and a very light set of grays to paint the rest of the site's elements.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			




<p>Scrypt is a slow-by-design <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a> or more accurately, a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">KDF</a> function. Its purpose is to take some input data, and create a fingerprint of that data, but to do it very slowly. A common use-case is to take a password and create an n-bit private key, which is much longer and more secure. Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">Qvault</a> we use a similar KDF for securing user passwords.</p>



<p>For example, let’s pretend your password is password1234. By using Scrypt, we can extend that deterministically into a 256-bit key:</p>



<p><strong>password1234 </strong>-&gt; <br>AwEEDA4HCwQFAA8DAwwHDQwPDwUOBwoOCQACAgUJBQ0JAAYNBAMCDQ4JCQgLDwcGDQMDDgMKAQsNBAkLAwsACA==</p>



<p>That long 256-bit key can now be used as a private key to encrypt and decrypt data. For example, it could be the key in an <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> cipher.</p>



<h2><span id="Why_not_use_the_password_to_encrypt_directly">Why not use the password to encrypt directly?</span>
</h2>



<p>Most encryption algorithms, including AES-256, require that a key of sufficient length is used. By hashing the password, we can derive a longer, more secure, fixed-size key.</p>



<p>Furthermore, using a KDF like Scrypt provides additional benefits over a traditional hash function like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Computationally expensive and slow</li>
<li>Memory intensive (potentially several gigabytes of RAM is used to execute the hash)</li>
</ul>
<p>Often times <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/02/11/how-do-brute-force-attackers-know-they-found-the-key/">brute-force attackers</a> will try to break encryption by guessing passwords over and over until they get it right. <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> and SHA-2 are fast, so an attacker would be able to guess many passwords per second. By using a slow hashing function like Scrypt to derive a key, we can force the attacker to waste more resources trying to break in.</p>



<h2><span id="Scrypt_Step-by-Step">Scrypt Step-by-Step</span>
</h2>



<p>Scrypt can be visualized by some psuedo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	// we'll get to theis
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s go through the steps of converting those inputs into the desired <code>derivedKey</code></p>



<h3><span id="1_-_Define_Blocksize">1 – Define Blocksize</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor</code></pre>



<h3><span id="2_-_Generate_Initial_Salt">2 – Generate Initial Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Scrypt uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> as a child key-derivation function. We use it to generate an initial salt. PBKDF2 has the following signature:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func PBKDF2(
	prf,
	password,
	salt,
	numIterations,
	desiredKeyLen
) derivedKey {}</code></pre>



<p>We use it as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="3_-_Mix_Salt">3 – Mix Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Next, we mix the salt. We split <code>initialSalt</code> into <code>splitSalt</code>, which is a 2D array of bytes. Each sub-array contains 1024 bytes</p>



<pre><code lang="go">splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
for i, block := range splitSalt {
	newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
	splitSalt[i] = newBlock
}</code></pre>



<p>where <code>roMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func roMix(block, iterations){
	v := []
	x := block
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		v[i] = x
		x = blockMix(x)
	}
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		j := integerify(x) % iterations
		x = blockMix(x ^ v[j])
	}
	return x
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>integerify</code> is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7914">RFC-7914</a> and <code>blockMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func blockMix(block){
	r := len(block) / 128
	// split block into an array of 2r 64-byte chunks
	chunks := get2r64ByteChunks()

	x := chunks[len(chunks)-1]
	y := []
	for i := 0; i &lt; len(chunks); i++{
		x = salsa20-8(x ^ chunks[i])
		y[i] = x
	}
	return [y[0], y[2], ...y[2r-2], y[1], y[3], ...y[2r-1]]
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>salsa20-8</code> is the 8-round version of the algorithm defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">here</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="4_-_Finalize_Salt">4 – Finalize Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Now <code>splitSalt</code> has been mixed in such a computationally exhausting way that we will call it an <code>expensiveSalt</code>. Expensive salt will be a single array of bytes, so we need to concatenate all the subarrays in <code>splitSalt</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="go">expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="5_-_Return_Final_KDF">5 – Return Final KDF</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)</code></pre>



<p>The final pseudocode for our top level function is as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor

	const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)

	splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
	for i, block := range splitSalt {
		newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
		splitSalt[i] = newBlock
	}

	expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)

	return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)
}</code></pre>



<p>Or, if you prefer, the pseudocode as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<pre><code lang="">Function scrypt
   Inputs:
      Passphrase:                Bytes    string of characters to be hashed
      Salt:                      Bytes    random salt
      CostFactor (N):            Integer  CPU/memory cost parameter - Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024)
      BlockSizeFactor (r):       Integer  blocksize parameter (8 is commonly used)
      ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer  Parallelization parameter. (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
      DesiredKeyLen:             Integer  Desired key length in bytes
   Output:
      DerivedKey:                Bytes    array of bytes, DesiredKeyLen long

   Step 1. Generate expensive salt
   blockSize ← 128*BlockSizeFactor  //Length (in bytes) of the SMix mixing function output (e.g. 128*8 = 1024 bytes)

   Use PBKDF2 to generate initial 128*BlockSizeFactor*p bytes of data (e.g. 128*8*3 = 3072 bytes)
   Treat the result as an array of p elements, each entry being blocksize bytes (e.g. 3 elements, each 1024 bytes)
   [B0...Bp−1] ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, Salt, 1, blockSize*ParallelizationFactor)

   Mix each block in B Costfactor times using ROMix function (each block can be mixed in parallel)
   for i ← 0 to p-1 do
      Bi ← ROMix(Bi, CostFactor)

   All the elements of B is our new "expensive" salt
   expensiveSalt ← B0∥B1∥B2∥ ... ∥Bp-1  //where ∥ is concatenation
 
   Step 2. Use PBKDF2 to generate the desired number of bytes, but using the expensive salt we just generated
   return PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, DesiredKeyLen);</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past we have <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-02-03-mapping-income-inequality-using-irs-soi-data/">blogged</a> about the IRS Sources of Income (SOI) data that we harvested and published as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/irs-soi/data/master">Dolt database</a>. We presented a compelling visualization that was relatively straightforward to create using that database. It was straightforward to create because of the work that went into transforming disparate and unruly files to a coherently presented database. Recently we <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">highlighted</a> a dataset of USPS Crosswalk mappings that are widely used into academic and commercial settings to traverse between ZIP code and other geographic statistical entities, for example counties. They are also available as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">Dolt database</a>. Finally just today we published US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/census-population-estimates">population estimates</a> by county, indexed on FIPS code going back to 2010.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive features of using Dolt and DoltHub together is how elegant they make acquiring these datasets in your local environment. There is no need to sign up, and we aren't tying you to a compute environment we will try and charge you for. They simply enable distribution of datasets along with a SQL interface. Dolt runs wherever you need it to run. Users can skip downloading, parsing, and cleaning collections of files, and begin analyzing the data immediately.</p>
<p>In this post we show how these features make it easy to combine a specifically interesting dataset, the IRS SOI data, with generally useful datasets, the USPS Crosswalk data and county level population estimates, to essentially toggle the spatial resolution of the IRS data. We conclude by advocating for the concept of a data dependency delivered as a "drop in" resource. The benefit of this model is for companies and individuals that depend on data, but do not see at as a core competency, to focus on what they do best. This is very much how open source software works.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To work through this locally you will need to get a copy of Dolt, which on <code>*nix</code> systems can be done with a single command, and we have documentation on the full range of installation options <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/#dolt">here</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ sudo bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash'</code></pre></div>
<p>For the analysis component, you will need Doltpy, which has all other libraries imported in the sample code as a dependency. It's available on PyPi:</p>

<p>For the visualization you will need several Python libraries, but they can easily be installed as follows:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>pip install plotly plotly-geo geopandas==0.3.0  pyshp==1.2.10</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's move onto to acquiring data.</p>
<h2>Acquiring data</h2>
<p>Acquiring data with Dolt is easy. Let's set up a home for our analysis:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs &amp;&amp; cd irs-analysis/dolt-dbs
$ dolt clone Liquidata/irs-soi
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/irs-soi
291,637 of 291,637 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$ dolt clone Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
210,458 of 210,458 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$  dolt clone Liquidata/census-population-estimates
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/census-population-estimates
82 of 82 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two Dolt databases in <code>~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs</code>, and we can launch the Dolt SQL shell in with the <code>--multi-db-dir</code> switch to make load them both into our SQL environment:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ ls -ltr
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  12 oscarbatori  staff  384 Jul 23 18:07 irs-soi
drwxr-xr-x   6 oscarbatori  staff  192 Jul 23 21:11 usps-crosswalk-data
$ dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
~/Documents/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs|&gt;&gt;  dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.
# Statements must be terminated with ';'.
# "exit" or "quit" (or Ctrl-D) to exit.

| irs_soi                     |
| usps_crosswalk_data         |
+-----------------------------+</code></pre></div>
<p>We have now acquired two datasets, both maintained by DoltHub. We can use <code>dolt pull</code> to subscribe to changes to the datasets, making any derivative analysis we create "live."</p>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>We will be working with adjusted gross income by ZIP code, and then using the USPS Crosswalk data and county population estiamtes to translate that to county level per capita income. This works because the USPS publishes mappings from ZIP codes to various geographical statistical entities identified by FIPS code, mappings that we completely capture (across time and mapping pairs). The data includes "ratios" of residential and business addresses for pairings that are not one to one. For example a ZIP code and straddle county lines, and vice versa, and so these ratios provide a mechanism for us approximate how much of a given aggregate to apportion when we perform the mapping.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at the data to see how it looks in practice:</p>

<p>We can see here a bunch of ZIP codes that are completely contained within counties. These ZIP codes contain only business addresses. That's not always the cade. Let's step into Python and do some analysis.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>We saw earlier how easy it was to acquire the data from DoltHub using Dolt. The USPS Crosswalk dataset took around 450 files to build, each of them Excel files. So running a single command was a pretty big time saving, even over the narrow subset of the data we are interested in, around 50 files. Loading them into Dolt also required removing some corrupt data, so that work is now embedded in the database, and amortized over everyone that takes advantage of it.</p>
<p>This simple acquisition model is only fraction of the benefit of acquiring data via Dolt and DoltHub. The balance comes from the SQL interface that arrives with the data. We don't need to parse files, we can just use SQL's elegant declarative syntax to describe the data we are interested in, and then let the query engine deliver it to our preferred interface, in this case Python.</p>
<p>The goal of our analysis is to translate ZIP code level income data to the county level, so let's grab each dataset, and then combine them:</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<p>One of the most fundamental reasons why I believe that the value of Bitcoin will continue to appreciate is because it is much easier for people to start believing in it than it is for people to stop.</p>



<p>Bitcoin believers tend to believe in it strongly and sometimes even irrationally. For many people, it is like a religion. For many more, Bitcoin has a continuous influence on their way of life not dissimilar to other modern systems of belief such as climate change and veganism. To varying degrees, Bitcoin believers will weather potentially any storm (decreases in its value, attacks in the media, etc.). Qualitatively, Bitcoin believers are quite strong.</p>



<p>Quantitatively, outside of Bitcoin’s still relatively small base of believers, there are many more people who do not sufficiently understand Bitcoin than there are people who do understand it but do not believe in it. If the last decade is any indication, a certain and probably high percentage of those who do not yet understand Bitcoin will quickly and easily come to believe in it once they do.</p>



<p>Having observed these dynamics of the Bitcoin belief system, I am near certain that non-owners are coming to believe in Bitcoin faster than owners are losing their belief. In other words, the outside population is buying into Bitcoin faster than than the inside population is selling out. This trend seems poised to continue indefinitely. As long as it does, so will the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value due to the increasing demand for the limited and finite supply.</p>



<p>One can think of Bitcoin as having a natural network effect where the owner population is expanding exponentially in comparison with an extremely low churn rate among its existing owners. It is this sort of network effect that has given rise to the most valuable companies of our time. Bitcoin is not a company but it stands to benefit just the same.</p>



<p>Quants can do all the fancy analysis they want but the simple fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is worth nothing without people’s belief in it. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, its value will plummet. If more people start believing in Bitcoin, its value will continue to appreciate. Because Bitcoin’s value is sustained solely by people’s belief in it, it seems to me that any prudent investor who makes a bullish case for Bitcoin should seek to support this most basic underlying assumption which says that the overall belief in Bitcoin is growing and will continue to grow. That is the assumption which I have sought to support with this piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In closing, it is worth stating clearly that money has no real value other than that which people believe it does. As long as people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it will be. Today it seems evident that Bitcoin believers are quickly accumulating and scarcely abandoning the asset. So long as this continues to be the case, and it seems more probable that not that it will, Bitcoin’s value will rise.</p>

        <p>Computers are cold and heartless. They don't lie, and they don't care if you scream and swear at them. You can abuse them all day long, and they'll still efficiently flip bits and push pixels.</p><p>But... people aren't. Behind every piece of software, there's at least one human. Who has a heart, and who cares what you think. Who has hopes, and dreams, and fears. Who feels.</p><p>This is something I've been wanting to write in one form or another for quite a while now, and I've been rewriting this post for a little too long.</p><p>Sometimes it seems like we forget about the humans. Either we forget that there's a human behind the software we build, or we forget that we're shipping software <em>for people</em>. </p><p>It seems to me that more and more, especially recently, nobody can share their work or their ideas without someone stepping in and criticising their ideas. Maybe they could have written it in a language that's faster, uses less memory, <em>something about bloat or native code.</em> Maybe it doesn't have a feature that another project does, so why the hell should anyone use it? &nbsp;</p><p>I remember earlier in my career, every time I opened a PR, I'd have a small feeling of anxiety. Was it good enough? What if I'm bad at programming? Would people hate it? What if I'm wrong? Fear of failure is one of the biggest obstacles to success, and all too often it stops people from sharing or achieving what they could. The feeling of "this isn't good enough to share" goes along with that.</p><p>Even while writing this, I couldn't help but feel like it isn't quite perfect, isn't quite good enough to share. But that's the point of my blog; I want to make myself put things out there, even if they're not 100%. </p><p>We should feel like it's ok to share work that isn't finished, that doesn't use the fastest, cleanest, most optimal approach. If I've made something for fun and want to share it, why not? If it doesn't use the technology you prefer, and you haven't paid me to build it, why would you shit all over someone else's work?</p><p>Better yet. If you care that much, make your own. Instead of pulling down something of someone else's', build your own thing up.</p><p>To some degree I understand people not being satisfied with professional software, that they have paid for, and that doesn't meet their expectations. But if it's open source, free, and available for all? Why would you ever complain about that? If it's not for you, just... move on.</p><p>Friends of mine won't share their blog posts to HN, Reddit, etc, because they feel like their words aren't good enough. Or like people there are going to tear them apart. Or because they might have made a small mistake somewhere.</p><p>The main thing I can see fuelling so many arguments is an inherent <em>need</em> to be right. It's been written about so many times before, but for some reason people can't bear the idea that <strong><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone on the internet is wrong</a></strong>. </p><p>Except, when it comes to the preferences of which tools or technology someone wants to build something with, in their own time, can you really be wrong? </p><p>There's a stereotype held about people in tech, that we're all that super nerdy person who struggles socially, can't talk to people, and hide all day in the basement programming. And that somehow, this is excusable if you're <em>really good </em>at writing code. But is it? If you're writing code for people to use, and you're working on it with people, not having people skills isn't really an option. Much like technical skills, it isn't an innate quality - you can work on improving your people skills, much like you can your tech skills.</p><p>If you take anything at all from my post, hopefully it's this; if you really must say something, and you really feel like someone made the wrong choice, maybe think about your phrasing. Eg</p><blockquote>Hey! Nice work. I was curious though, why'd you pick &lt;tech&gt; over &lt;other tech&gt;?</blockquote><p>vs</p><blockquote>Ugh, this would be so much better if it just used &lt;tech&gt;. I hate the way modern tech is going</blockquote><p>Let's make our industry a much more friendly and welcoming place 💖</p>

    <p>(Live thread, will be updated with new visuals and polish over the next few days. Join <a href="http://eepurl.com/gl0BHL">the mailing list</a> to get updated when completed)</p>

<p>A trained language model generates text.</p>

<p>We can optionally pass it some text as input, which influences its output.</p>

<p>The output is generated from what the model “learned” during its training period where it scanned vast amounts of text.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/01-gpt3-language-model-overview.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Training is the process of exposing the model to lots of text. That process has been completed. All the experiments you see now are from that one trained model. It was estimated to cost 355 GPU years and cost $4.6m.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/02-gpt3-training-language-model.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The dataset of 300 billion tokens of text is used to generate training examples for the model. For example, these are three training examples generated from the one sentence at the top.</p>

<p>You can see how you can slide a window across all the text and make lots of examples.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-training-examples-sliding-window.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The model is presented with an example. We only show it the features and ask it to predict the next word.</p>

<p>The model’s prediction will be wrong. We calculate the error in its prediction and update the model so next time it makes a better prediction.</p>

<p>Repeat millions of times</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/03-gpt3-training-step-back-prop.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Now let’s look at these same steps with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>GPT3 actually generates output one token at a time (let’s assume a token is a word for now).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/04-gpt3-generate-tokens-output.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Please note: This is a description of how GPT-3 works and not a discussion of what is novel about it (which is mainly the ridiculously large scale). The architecture is a transformer decoder model based on this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf</p>

<p>GPT3 is MASSIVE. It encodes what it learns from training in 175 billion numbers (called parameters). These numbers are used to calculate which token to generate at each run.</p>

<p>The untrained model starts with random parameters. Training finds values that lead to better predictions.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-parameters-weights.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>These numbers are part of hundreds of matrices inside the model. Prediction is mostly a lot of matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=mSTCzNgDJy4">Intro to AI on YouTube</a>, I showed a simple ML model with one parameter. A good start to unpack this 175B monstrosity.</p>

<p>To shed light on how these parameters are distributed and used, we’ll need to open the model and look inside.</p>

<p>GPT3 is 2048 tokens wide. That is its “context window”. That means it has 2048 tracks along which tokens are processed.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/05-gpt3-generate-output-context-window.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Let’s follow the purple track. How does a system process the word “robotics” and produce “A”?</p>

<p>High-level steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert the word to <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">a vector (list of numbers) representing the word</a></li>
  <li>Compute prediction</li>
  <li>Convert resulting vector to word</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/06-gpt3-embedding.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The important calculations of the GPT3 occur inside its stack of 96 transformer decoder layers.</p>

<p>See all these layers? This is the “depth” in “deep learning”.</p>

<p>Each of these layers has its own 1.8B parameter to make its calculations. That is where the “magic” happens. This is a high-level view of that process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/07-gpt3-processing-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>You can see a detailed explanation of everything inside the decoder in my blog post <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT2</a>.</p>

<p>The difference with GPT3 is the alternating dense and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf">sparse self-attention layers</a>.</p>

<p>This is an X-ray of an input and response (“Okay human”) within GPT3. Notice how every token flows through the entire layer stack. We don’t care about the output of the first words. When the input is done, we start caring about the output. We feed every word back into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/08-gpt3-tokens-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>In the React code generation example (https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264), the description would be the input prompt (in green), in addition to a couple of examples of description=&gt;code, I believe. And the react code would be generated like the pink tokens here token after token.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the priming examples and the description are appended as input, with specific tokens separating examples and the results. Then fed into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/09-gpt3-generating-react-code-example.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>It’s impressive that this works like this. Because you just wait until fine-tuning is rolled out for the GPT3. The possibilities will be even more amazing.</p>

<p>Fine-tuning actually updates the model’s weights to make the model better at a certain task.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/10-gpt3-fine-tuning.gif">
  <br>

				<p>Streaming services offered by companies like Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Co are getting more and more popular. Millions of subscribers stream countless hours of movies and tv series every month. Subscriber get access to a large media library for a monthly fee (subscription).</p><hr><h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2><p>Netflix and similar streaming services can only earn money as long as they can deliver new content.</p><hr><p>Netflix is the king of streaming. The company perfects the streaming business with nearly <a href="https://www.netflixinvestor.com/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">193 million paying subscribers at the end of Q2 2020</a>.</p><p>The share price of Netflix reflect its success:</p><figure><img src="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png" alt="" srcset="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 600w, https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 1000w, https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 1600w, https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 2150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Netflix share price. Screenshot taken at Jul 21, 2020. <a href="https://www.netflixinvestor.com/stock-information/stock-chart/default.aspx">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Even during one of the worst modern pandemic, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Netflix' share price just knows one direction: Upwards. Streaming is undoubtedly the future of entertainment.</p><p>But there is one problem — the problem I refer to as <strong>The Entertainment Loop</strong>. To understand the problem, we have to understand how Netflix (and similar services) make money. It's actually fairly simple.</p><h2 id="how-making-money-works-in-the-21st-century">How Making Money Works in the 21st Century</h2><p>In just one single word: Subscription. For a small monthly fee you, as a company, provide a good service to your customer. This has two main advantages over the old school "pay once and get something" sales tactic:</p><ol><li>Due to the relatively small fee you are able to reach a large customer audience in comparison to a high (one-time)-fee.</li><li>If you, as a company, are able to successfully bind the paying customer to your service, the monthly compounding fee outgrows the large "one-time-fee" that you could've charged instead.</li></ol><p>It is important to understand these two advantages and why companies decide for a monthly subscription business instead of a one-time-fee business. There are additional advantages in the subscription-based model, but we'll keep it simple for now.</p><p>These two advantages are the key to Netflix success. That's the good (probably awesome) part of the story. But here comes the story: These two advantages <strong>will cause damage </strong>to your company in the future.</p><p>To understand why, we'll have to understand, how Netflix makes money.</p><h2 id="how-netflix-makes-money">How Netflix Makes Money</h2><p>Netflix makes money by selling monthly subscriptions in exchange for unlimited movies and tv &nbsp;on their platform. That's it. It's that simple.</p><p>Let's think about the service in exchange for the monthly fee, to understand the problem: Unlimited streaming of movies and tv series.</p><p>Netflix main goal is to make the user stay and keep paying. For reach that ultimate goal, Netflix has to deliver value to the user. Every month — or he will leave and stop paying the monthly fee. That's why Netflix has to keep pushing new content for every users' own (movie-)taste. Once the user doesn't receive any new value from Netflix, he will stop paying for the service. And Netflix only way to provide value is to deliver movies and tv-series.</p><p>I'm pretty sure that you understood this, but let me try to clarify (and simplify) it with a flow chart:</p><figure><img src="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Entertainment-Loop-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Broken down to one line: <strong>Netflix will not earn any money, if they don't add new content.</strong></p><h2 id="how-netflix-can-solve-this-problem-and-why-it-isn-t-easy">How Netflix can solve this problem and why it isn't easy</h2><p>Netflix can solve this problem by adding new content (surprise!). But they will encounter a second problem, if they keep adding content: Costs.</p><p>Let's think it through. The loop goes like this:</p><ol><li>Netflix adds content</li><li>Costs increase</li><li>New (paying) subscribers join because of the new content</li><li>Existing subscribers are happy and keep paying</li><li>Newly added content gets old and boring</li><li>Less new (paying) subscribers</li><li>Existing subscribers get bored and start leaving</li><li>Netflix has to add new content</li><li>Go to #1</li></ol><p>That is the Entertainment Loop. And it is nearly impossible to break out of it.</p><p>And this is just the start of the problem. The key here is, that Netflix has to add more and more new content to make existing customers happy. But they not only need the existing customers, they will need new customers to cover the increasing costs. And the costs will increase because, you might already guess it, Netflix has to deliver value (content) to the existing customers to make them stay (and keep them happy).</p><p>But the number of new (paying) subscribers isn't increasing from month to month. It will flatten in decline. Reason for that is, that the number of potential new customers is finite. There are not (!) unlimited new possible subscriber.</p><p>The real trouble starts once Netflix approaches the limit of adding new subscribers. New and fresh money stops floating in like the year before, but the expectations for new value (new content) of the existing customers is not declining — it is staying at least the same or the expectation will even increase.</p><p>So Netflix will have to deliver even more new value in form of content like movies and tv series. And that increases the costs — again. And now Netflix is in a situation, where the costs keep increasing (or staying the same) but the money they earn from paying subscribers will not increase that much. And that is the Entertainment Loop.</p><h2 id="first-counterargument-against-this">First counterargument against this</h2><p>Actually, do the costs keep increasing? You might deny this question. Each month, Netflix need more or less the same amount of new movies and tv series to keep the subscribers happy and paying. So the costs stay more or less the same, don't they? The answer is yes... but actually, no.</p><p>The costs keep increasing. And that's why:</p><p>First of, the expectations for new content keeps increasing. That makes the production more expensive.</p><p>Second, Netflix' new subscribes are not <em>mainstream</em> subscribers. The "normal" subscriber who likes mainstream movies and tv series has already subscribed to Netflix. Netflix gains more and more subscribers who want to the <em>non-mainstream</em> content. That keeps increasing the costs as Netflix has to produce more and more of the <em>non-mainstream </em>content.</p><p>That keeps the costs increasing.</p><p>Of course, if a new subscriber joins, he'll be happy for some time, because he can watch all the content that Netflix added over the time when he wasn't a subscriber. But at some point, he'll run out of existing content to consume. Then Netflix has to deliver new content, to keep him happy and subscribing.</p><h2 id="second-counterargument-against-this">Second counterargument against this</h2><p>Netflix could just increase its prices for a subscription step by step. Increasing the costs, by, let's say 10%, would increase Netflix revenue immediately. And a 10% price increase wouldn't hurt the user.</p><p>Problem with that is, that Netflix cannot create a monopoly. Unlike famous companies like Apple, anyone could build a streaming business. The technology is fairly simple (I mean, it is very complicated, but if you hire a lot of good software engineers and product managers, it would be possible to create a streaming service like Netflix has). And it is very hard to bind users to the value Netflix delivers: Movies and tv series. Of course, there will be some people who want to see the next season of a Netflix Original. But different producers could also create a tv series which binds users to it. In addition, it isn't very profitable for a company to produce a large number of seasons for a tv series.</p><p>That's because every additional season of a tv series costs more money to a company than the previous one. Why? Because who wants to see the following season? Only the people who also watch the previous one. Or did you ever said "damn, I really want to see season 5 of the show x", without having watched season 1 to 4 of show x? Producing a new season of a tv series will not make a company more money than the previous one. That's why it is incredible hard to bind users to a movie/tv-series business. Creating good content is interchangeable.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This entertainment loop happens to every movie subscription company. I referred to Netflix as a practical example, because this company is the current #1 in the streaming-universe.</p><p>I have no business relation to Netflix or any of their competitors besides being invested in their stocks via global index funds (ETF).</p><p>And yes — I'm a happy customer of Netflix. As long as they deliver new content.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

					<p>#Noise #pollution is one of the main stressors in urban environments, having negative impacts on people’s quality of life and health. For some groups of citizens, such as school children, patients, and elders, there is a need to support them in finding pedestrian routes in noise polluted areas of cities. In<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139350" target="_blank"> a new paper</a>, <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">we</a> focus on the <strong>estimation of traffic noise</strong>, and present an approach to <strong>provide quiet routing services</strong>, <em>taking into account the estimated noise levels of roads</em>.</p>
<p>By combining Volunteered Geographic Information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), official socio-economic data, and open-access GPS trajectory data, we develop a set of traffic related variables, and apply machine learning methods to perform<strong> traffic volume estimations</strong>. Given the estimated traffic information, an existing traffic noise model is then employed to derive the noise polluted areas. For generation of quiet routes, a new routing algorithm is proposed. It minimizes the exposure of pedestrians to traffic noise pollution while taking into account the route distance constraint. We apply our quiet routing approach to the city of Heidelberg (Germany). The application results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in the generation of quiet routes customized to pedestrian preferences.</p>

<p>In earlier work we looked already into generating customized pleasant pedestrian routes based on several factors like greenness, noise and sociability, and added this to <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" target="_blank">Openrouteservice</a> by <a href="http://heigit.org/" target="_blank">HeiGIT</a> &amp; <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">GIScience HD</a>:</p>

<p>Also currently we started to <a href="http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2020/06/19/going-green-with-meingrun-today-app-launch-in-heidelberg-and-dresden/">test related approaches in Dresden and Heidelberg</a> in the context of the <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/meingruen_en.html" target="_blank">meinGrün</a> project.<br>
This builds upon early work by <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/md/chemgeo/geog/gis/arcviewbuch-zipf-roether.pdf" target="_blank">Zipf and Röther (2000)</a>, But nowadays the needed data sources are much more available, so that it becomes possible to scale these ideas to new levels using open data which allow to finetune and evaluate the approach using real world data.</p>
<p>The relevance of green spaces for wellbeing and mental health in cities has been proofed by a study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0451-y" target="_blank">Nature Neuroscience</a></p>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	If there was any hope that a global pandemic would help slow down Toronto's booming housing market this new listing proves that’s not the case.</p>
<p>
	A tiny two-bedroom, one bathroom home on Euclid Street in Little Italy has just hit the market for $999,999.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The "rare detached bungalow located in the heart of Toronto" is advertised as being a "great size" with "loads of potential."</p>

<p>
	Property taxes on the home will set you back $5,307 per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to a report from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board earlier this month, home sales in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and prices are on the rise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The real estate board said there were 8,701 homes sold in June, down 1.4 per cent compared with the same month last year.</p>
<p>
	On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales in June were up 84 per cent compared with May.</p>
<p>
	The average selling price in the GTA was $930,869, up 11.9 per cent compared with June 2019.</p>

  <p><span>27 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and
there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired
information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an
abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored.</p>

<p>In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and
how they fit together when writing your own.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-disk">Structuring the disk</h2>
<p>When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is
written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives
don’t have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it
is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file
system to make sense of it all.</p>

<p>A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the
majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store
metadata that is essential for the file system operation.</p>

<p>The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the
information on the disk:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_filesystem_blocks.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>File system structure in a disk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means.</p>

<h3 id="superblock-and-bitmaps">Superblock and bitmaps</h3>

<p>The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the
following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how
many are free, etc.</p>

<p>Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index
in the bitmap set to <code>0</code> indicates a free slot, and an index set to <code>1</code>
indicates an occupied slot.</p>

<h3 id="inode">Inode</h3>

<p>The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as
permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved
in an inode.</p>

<p>The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the <em>inode table</em> as the
following figure shows.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_inode_table.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode table (detailed view)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For each slot in the inode bitmap set to <code>1</code>, there will be a corresponding
inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table.
And this explains the name inode being a short name for <em>index node</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-blocks">Data blocks</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data
belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different
purposes which we will see shortly.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-to-data">Pointing to data</h2>

<p>The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the
file. The simplest way is to have <strong>direct pointers</strong>. In this case, each
pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that
large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can
have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use
<strong>indirect pointers</strong>, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to
blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is
added with <strong>double indirect pointers</strong>. And for even larger files, <strong>triple
indirect pointers</strong> are put to use.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_direct_pointers.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode multi-level index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let’s run an
example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the
majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up
to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect
pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4
GiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around
4 TiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup> + 1024<sup>3</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example,
a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can
be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk.</p>

<p>Some file systems use <strong>extents</strong> to help with this situation. In this approach,
there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the
address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example
above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB.
Multiple extents can be used to support larger files.</p>

<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn’t a specific structure for directories. The
reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories.
The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks.
Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the
form of <code>(name, index number)</code> so when looking up a particular file (or another
directory), the system uses the <code>name</code> to find the corresponding inode.</p>

<p>Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of
files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using
binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a
balanced search tree could also be used.</p>

<h2 id="access-paths">Access paths</h2>

<h3 id="read">Read</h3>

<p>When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path,
visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file.
Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults
which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them.</p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding
inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate
the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to
the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the
bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to
the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when
creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also
has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a
new inode.</p>

<h2 id="gotenksfs">GotenksFS</h2>

<p>As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I’m learning
the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this
section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the
disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1
KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4
KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size.</p>

<h3 id="mkfs"><code>mkfs</code></h3>

<p>The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for
the file system. This is achieved via the <code>mkfs</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img <span>-s</span> <span>"10 GiB"</span> <span>-b</span> 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and
each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB.</p>

<p>In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root
directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its
corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be
necessary for the next step: mounting the file system.</p>

<h3 id="mount"><code>mount</code></h3>

<p>After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The
<code>mount</code> command is used for this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you can see some information about it:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>File system after mounting</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</h3>

<p>The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the
configuration values provided in the <code>mkfs</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Superblock</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of
<code>n</code> blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the
ones where user data will be written.</p>

<p>The inode is defined as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Inode</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>libc</span><span>::</span><span>mode_t</span><span>,</span>

    <span>pub</span> <span>modified_at</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>changed_at</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i64</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>direct_blocks</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>u32</span><span>;</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>],</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>indirect_block</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>double_indirect_block</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that
for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB.
The number of direct pointers is set to 12:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using
the definition below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Directory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>BTreeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>OsString</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="block-groups">Block groups</h3>

<p>The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity
for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an <code>Inode</code> to 128 bytes; the
corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for
structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the
corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for
user data.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, we can create <em>block groups</em> that will always have one
block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks
contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for
user data.</p>

<!--
For a disk as in our case of 10 GiB, how many blocks should be dedicated to inode bitmaps?

Increasing the number of blocks to be inode bitmaps reduces the amount of available data blocks. And reducing the number of inode bitmaps restricts the total number of files supported by the system.

				<blockquote>We're <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/show">trending on Hacker News</a> - Please join the conversation there!</blockquote><p>In today's remote first world, Slack is increasingly becoming the natural place that communication and collaboration happen in all aspects of work. Personally, I look at Slack each morning before I look at email or even social media, making it the natural jump off point for the most important interactions that I have professionally.</p><div><p>Never has this also been more true, than for complex developer workflows which teams need to share to ensure enablement across their entire development team.</p><p>Traditionally, a developer would have to interface with many different softwares in order to complete their tasks, increasing the context that they need within each domain in order to complete their job. All of this comes at the expense of developer productivity and this is why CTO.ai set out to improve the holistic developer experience by re-imagining what DevOps should look like, Slack first.</p><p>Today we are happy to announce that we're continuing to invest into our mission to make DevOps more accessible and enjoyable for the next 40 million developers with the release of our Slack Home feature, which naturally acts as an easily accessible Control Plane for all of your team's developer workflows!</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/07/home-tab.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><div><p>Within the Slack Home, you can quickly navigate the CTO.ai teams which you have joined and easily execute the workflows associated to that team, simply by clicking the Run button and picking the channel that you want to run the workflow in.</p><p>This makes it even easier for DevOps teams and Senior Engineers to build and distribute their developer tools to their entire team by creating a centralized control plane for accessing these often privileged and complex workflows.</p><p>Team management has also become centralized. At a glance, leads can see what teams they have created, what channels are associated to them and who are the members of the teams. You can now add team members from this location as well.</p><p>Soon, we'll also allow you to look at Workflow Events and even Metrics associated to the custom workflows that each team has architected, which represent their deliverables and day to day work, empowering leads with a strong feedback loop.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/07/home-tab-teams.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>When a developer executes a workflow, the workflow can be then targeted to run in any channel which is associated to the team, giving the same inherit benefits which many of our users are already enjoying with SlackOps, such as; Secrets, Configs, Logs, Events and ultimately the inherent transparency and accessibility of Slack.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/07/home-tab-runop.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here is a quick video overview of how this new feature works:</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8RxGak-Bl3I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>A demo of the new Slack Home - a control plane for DevOps workflows</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>We're really excited about what this new feature does to unlock the power of DevOps to truly enable Devs to leverage the 10x power of Ops.

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>price</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span>

<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>customer</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span>

<span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>sale</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>customer_id</span> <span>int</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 18.413 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_customer_fk</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FOREIGN</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>customer</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>);</span>
<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 5.464 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>sale_created_ix</span> <span>ON</span> <span>sale</span><span>(</span><span>created</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE INDEX</span>
<span>Time: 12.605 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SELECT</span>

<span>INSERT 0 1000000</span>
<span>Time: 15410.234 ms (00:15.410)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After defining constraints and indexes, loading a million rows to the table took ~15.4s.</p>
<p>Next, try to load the data into the table first, and only then add constraints and indexes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>SALE</span> <span>(</span><span>created</span><span>,</span> <span>product_id</span><span>,</span> <span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>
<span>----+-------------------+----------</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        1</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        2</span>

<p>They say sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I think about that every time I hear about another protest against a speaker or an idea.  If you really want to kill stupid ideas, you should actually let people discuss them publicly.  Otherwise, they get pushed to the far corners of the internet filled with other nutjobs*  There they get sympathy, not just for their idea, but for the fact that they were not allowed to speak publicly about it.</p>



<p>If someone wants to give a controversial talk, like to say that women are less intelligent than men, or that the Holocaust never happened, or that one race is genetically inferior to the other races, the best way to marginalize those ideas and highlight how stupid they are is to let them speak.  Don’t even waste time on protesting the speaker.  Don’t cancel them.  Shrug and say it’s not even worth your time to fight, or, if you do want to fight, go listen to the talk and write a summary online about how idiotic the talk was.</p>



<p>The way to defeat ideas you don’t like is to make them compete in the public domain of ideas, not to censor them.  When you censor them, you think you are squashing them out, but you are just giving them protected time and space to grow and find more supporters.</p>



<p>*<em>if you are reading this at some point in the future, it is quite possible that the term “nutjob” is politically incorrect for some reason, but as of the date I am writing this it is within the bounds of things you can say, so please don’t crucify me in 2035 for writing this in 2020.</em> </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"

<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>When you deploy your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster&nbsp;you can select the scaling options. Moreover, you can also set up <strong>continuous delivery</strong> for your microservice.</p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

What if you could debug type errors with a simple compile time print statement? Write highly flexible systems by being able to introspect into types at compile time? Pre-calculate large portions of your programs for great efficiency? Typed functional programming is a great and fun way to write resilient software, and as type systems have become more and more expressive in recent years, we are able to program sophisticated and useful properties at the type level for even better compile time safety. Just one problem: It is very difficult, requires advanced knowledge of the type system, the syntax is convoluted, the error messages are impenetrable, and it is nearly impossible to debug. This talk will dive into why we should steal static introspection from languages like Nim, and D, state-of-the-art imperative programming languages which can solve all these issues, make type systems much more approachable without losing any expressive power, and offer new design possibilities for functional programs.</em></p><p id="bf8b"><em>Join us on Zoom: </em><a href="https://zoom.us/j/95139644343" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://zoom.us/j/95139644343</em></a></p><p id="f699"><em>Join us on YouTube: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI</em></a></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="31bb"><em>Many things are being said about Deep Reinforcement Learning, but sometimes it is really hard to know where to start.

Created to solve the two language problem, Julia is demonstrating performance gains of 50x-100x for many data science tasks such as data loading, data processing, graph processing, machine learning and scaling. Robust support for modern deep learning and the ability to do differentiable programming in an intuitive way is quickly leading to Julia becoming the language of choice for AI workloads. My talk will discuss the origin story of Julia, the formation of the Julia community, and all the amazing things happening in the world of Julia.</em></p><p id="fb33"><em>Join us on Zoom: </em><a href="https://zoom.us/j/94906592252" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://zoom.us/j/94906592252</em></a></p><p id="a2c6"><em>Join us on YouTube: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/fbKHLdoG7wA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://youtu.be/fbKHLdoG7wA</em></a></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*-gyZtKfGpWBIxRoz" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*-gyZtKfGpWBIxRoz 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*-gyZtKfGpWBIxRoz 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*-gyZtKfGpWBIxRoz 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*-gyZtKfGpWBIxRoz 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*-gyZtKfGpWBIxRoz?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="36c8"><em>Scientific machine learning is a burgeoning field and its taking off in Julia.

<p>Our spunky little Honda Fit is now 13 years old, and although it has served us well, we have begun to outgrow it.</p>

<p>I started researching minivans, and one particular online-only auto seller seemed to have an attractive inventory.</p>

<p>So I decided to create an account with them and set up some filters and alerts.</p>

<p>But creating an account was harder than it appeared.</p>

<p>I entered my email address on their sign-up page.  The input field immediately turned red, and the page informed me that my email address was invalid.</p>

<p>I encounter this problem occasionally, because I use subaddressing in my email address.</p>

<p>A normal email address looks like this: <code>username@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When you use subaddressing, you tack on a little extra bit between your username and the @ sign: <code>username+subaddress@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When the site emails you, the subaddress gets ignored for the purpose of routing the message to you, 
   but it shows up in the "To" field of the email address.  That can be tremendously useful.  It allows
   you to set up filters to always allow or always deny messages that include a specific subaddress,
   and it can sometimes be used to determine whether a site has had a data breach or sold your contact
   information to spammers.</p>

<p>Although subaddressing is widely supported by email service providers, including Google's Gmail, it continues to trip up sites
   that perform email address validation using regular expressions, also known by the abbreviation regex.</p>
   
<p>Regex allows site developers to specify what a valid email address looks like.  
   It can determine whether an email address contains invalid characters, or whether it's missing an @ sign.</p>
   
<p>The problem is, valid email addresses come in many forms, and many regular expressions used to validate email addresses
   are not able to recognize the full range of valid formats.</p>
   
<p>In the case of the auto seller's form validation, I was able to inspect their Javascript code.
   The portion of the email validation regex that deals with the username (the part before the @ sign)
   looks like this:</p>
   
<p><code>^[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*</code></p>

<p>The key thing about this regex snippet is that the only characters that are considered valid are
   alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods.</p>
   
<p>If a plus sign is present, as when using subaddressing, it treats the email address as invalid, even though it is perfectly valid
   — and has been for years.</p>
   
<p>While it's frustrating that many sites continue to reject email addresses that use subaddressing, I have a Plan B.</p>

<p>I instead use a secondary email address without subaddressing, which is associated with <a href="https://newlywed.science/">newlywed.science</a>,
   a domain I use to promote my book <i>Experiments for Newlyweds</i>.</p>
   
<p>I entered that email address into the sign-up form, but again I was informed that it was invalid.</p>

<p>I took another look at the email validation regex and discovered an even stupider issue.</p>

<p>Here is the portion of their email validation regex that deals with the domain (the part after the @ sign):</p>
   
<p><code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})$</code></p>

<p>The relevant part of this snippet is at the very end.  It says that the top-level domain (TLD) must be between two and four letters long.</p>

<p>The most well-known TLDs, such as .com, .org, .net, .edu, and .gov, tend to have three letters.  
   Country-specific TLDs, such as .uk or .de, tend to have two letters.</p>
   
<p>But starting around the turn of the century, more and more new TLDs came into use.  
   For instance, .museum became active in June 2001, and .travel began accepting registrations in January 2006.</p>
   
<p>So TLDs that exceed four letters in length have been around for quite a while.</p>

<p>Yet anyone with an email address associated with such a TLD is locked out of creating an account with this auto seller because of this regex.</p>

<p>It's frustrating that major websites continue to rely on such shoddy email address validation, and this time I decided to make my frustration known.</p>

<p>I searched around for a contact email address on the site, but the best I could find was a Live Chat feature.</p>

<p>So, at 2 p.m. Eastern, I opened a Live Chat session and encouraged them to fix their terrible regex.</p>

<p>A robo-responder informed me that unfortunately, my message could not be handled, because Live Chat is only available between 8 a.m. and 8:45 p.m. Eastern.</p>

<p><em>Thet Lynn Han, known as Ricky Thet, is the 36-year-old founder and CEO of Bagan IT. The Myanmar-based development company has been operating since 2010, when Thet moved back to Myanmar from Singapore. Bagan’s products include a local-language keyboard, an e-bookstore, and a fortune-telling service.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Are we coders or phone fixers?</strong></h3>



<p>When my <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16546688">country began to change</a> in 2010, to open up, I knew I wanted to be part of building the new Myanmar. But, at that time, there was none of the basic infrastructure the rest of the world takes for granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My parents wanted me to be a doctor, but I loved computers. I couldn’t study computer science in Myanmar when I graduated from high school in 2000, so I left for Singapore to study and then stayed there to work.</p>



<p>During the ten years I was&nbsp;living in Singapore, I wanted to read books in Burmese, but back then, almost none of them were digitized. You had to have a hard copy. So when I came back,<strong> </strong>I<strong> </strong>wanted to put Burmese-language books online.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>In 2012, when we launched our first apps, very <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=MM">few people were online</a> in Myanmar, and data was very expensive. People would often turn off their data when they weren’t using it. That meant it was almost impossible to get user insights about what wasn’t working for users, and digital literacy was very low.</p>



<p>We began working with the mobile phone technicians at the local tuck shops where people buy and fix their phones. Often, when customers had issues with their phones or just didn’t know how to use certain features, they’d come back to the shops where they had purchased them and have the technicians help. We’d show these guys how to use our apps so they could answer a customer’s question about our products. If we were releasing something new, we’d let the technicians know, so they could tell their customers.</p>



<p>We had whole relationship teams who would travel around the country to meet with mobile shop owners, collect their insights, and show them how to use our latest applications.</p>



	




<h3><strong>One product at a time</strong></h3>



<p>Our first product was a Burmese-language keyboard. The most common Burmese font, Zawgyi, is not compatible with Unicode, the international standard for encoding fonts, and the background processing is based on the English language. This was especially an issue, because between 40% and 50% of the phones in Myanmar are Chinese phones made for the Chinese domestic market. All of these obstacles combined meant there were a lot of rendering issues and limitations for the Burmese font.</p>

<p>Google didn’t launch its Burmese-language keyboard in Myanmar until a few years ago, but we were here first. We could see what the Burmese people needed. Our keyboard currently has 10 million monthly active users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the Burmese keyboard, we tackled books. The publishers were suspicious of digitizing books at first, and it took years of building relationships with them to get the 10,000 books we have online now. Same thing with our fortune-telling app, Min Thein Kha, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200425-online-mystics-cash-in-during-myanmar-virus-lockdown">which has 50,000 daily active users</a>. Once the payments for the e-bookstore were running, it was a proof of concept we brought to the family of Min Thein Kha, the most famous Burmese fortune teller. They saw that the fortune tellers they worked with could get paid if they put their services on an app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the biggest challenge was payments. Less than 2% of people in Myanmar have<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/sg/Documents/consumer-business/sea-cb-myanmar-consumer-survey-2020.pdf"> access to a credit card</a>, and <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/countrybook/Myanmar.pdf">75% </a>are unbanked. We needed to find a different way to bill them.</p>



<p>The local telecom companies are the only entities that cover the whole population. We persuaded them to let us charge users for app-based purchases on their telephone bills, but we had to be very deliberate when designing to make it clear to people that that’s what they should expect. Even that was not a perfect solution; a credit card might charge you an extra 5% on top of your purchase. With the telecom companies, it could be anywhere from 45% to 60% in additional charges and fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to partner with the telecom companies for billing, we needed to be able to ensure a minimum guaranteed revenue, so it was, and still is, very important that everything we built be attractive to our users. And we needed to demonstrate that we had the capacity to handle all of the customer support.</p>



<h3><strong>Building everything yourself</strong></h3>



<p>In other countries, these kinds of payment and customer-service systems&nbsp;would already be set up. Things are changing quickly here in Myanmar — mobile money is becoming more popular — but even now, I’d say only 30% of our work is building the apps, whereas 70% is dealing with these kinds of infrastructure issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as things are progressing and more, and Burmese people are coming online and getting phones, we can call customers directly to get insights. We’re also getting some data using Facebook, but more than anything else, we rely on calling people for feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early years, we had an automatic refund policy —&nbsp;if someone said they were charged incorrectly, we’d give the money back, no questions asked. It’s an important way to build trust with people who are using apps like these for the first time. If we didn’t get it right, how would users ever trust something like mobile money?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw it as an investment in our users and in our future.</p>

			<p>APIs are everywhere within your organization. Many may be internal, but we’re willing to bet there are many third-party web services and APIs that your business depends on too. Keeping track of them all, and ensuring that your team chooses the best APIs for their needs can be a challenge. In some cases, your organization may be using an API they don’t even know about. The solution to this “web of APIs” is to apply the concept of API governance to your API dependencies.</p><h2 id="what-is-api-governance">What is API Governance?</h2><p>Before we go into applying the concept to third-party APIs, we should look at what API governance is.</p><p>API governance is a set of policies and procedures that act as <strong>guidelines for how your organization uses APIs</strong>. Governance is all about security and reliability. It can take many shapes, but it helps with things like:</p><ul><li>Establishing criteria for choosing APIs.</li><li>Defining any shared standards, like security, that APIs will share.</li><li>Aids in the discovery of existing APIs in the organization.</li><li>Laying out plans for usage, versioning, etc.</li></ul><p>This process makes a lot of sense when a good part of your stack is dedicated to providing APIs, but what about the external APIs that your organization consumes? Can you apply a similar approach to the APIs you depend on, even if you don’t have control over them?</p><h3 id="applying-the-idea-of-governance-to-third-party-apis">Applying the idea of governance to third-party APIs</h3><p>As your organization grows, there’s a high likelihood that every API consumed won’t be known. Development teams working on different products and services may have some overlap, but what are the chances of two teams signing up for the same API? What about choosing two differing APIs that serve the same purpose?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg" alt="Governance over APIs" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>For third party APIs, the governance process can lead to two key artifacts: an <strong>API catalog</strong> and a <strong>set of guidelines for choosing APIs</strong>. Let’s look at some API governance best practices, but applied to third-party API dependencies.</p><h2 id="api-catalogs">API Catalogs</h2><p>When we onboard new customers to Bearer, some often discover that their organization is using APIs they didn’t know about. This isn’t unique to giant organizations either. Even small teams can run into this problem. An API catalog can be a valuable way to centralize details about all the services and APIs that your organization uses. The format this catalog takes can change with the needs of your organization, but the benefits can directly affect your development teams as well as your business strategy. Let’s look at a few benefits, and things you may want to include in your own API catalog.</p><h3 id="increased-discoverability">Increased Discoverability</h3><p>By collecting details about each API, your team can create a centralized location for the whole organization. This allows teams to discover which SaaS providers you already have a relationship with, and which services are currently available. </p><p>This is also a great way to avoid duplication across teams, and avoids the selection of similar APIs that serve the same purpose.</p><h3 id="sla-tracking">SLA Tracking</h3><p>Service-level Agreements (SLA) are a contract between your organization and the API provider. It can often be hard to keep track of expectations at a high level. A central catalog of APIs offers a place for all SLA details to be stored.</p><p>You can take this a step further by incorporating monitoring to ensure that services are meeting their requirements, and even tie this directly into the catalog for at-a-glance oversight.</p><h3 id="centralized-test-coverage">Centralized Test Coverage</h3><p>While it may not be feasible or even possible to incorporate testing directly into an API catalog, it can be an excellent place to store coverage statistics. How are, or perhaps in the dark, are you about the last time tests were run on a particular API endpoint? Is it possible there is a rarely used API in your stack that has been down for a while, unbeknownst to your team? Bring the results into your API catalog.</p><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>Are you paying for service that you no longer use? By tracking API usage across an entire organization, you can examine areas such as:</p><ul><li>Which teams are currently using an API?</li><li>Is the organization on the most cost-effective plan?</li><li>Are there multiple, similar APIs in use when a single one could suffice?</li><li>On <em>pay-as-you-go</em> plans where you pay for each call, are you often over budget?</li></ul><h3 id="knowledge-base">Knowledge Base</h3><p>The centralized test coverage portion covers part of this benefit, but your API catalog can act as a central knowledge base for every API in your organization. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>Internal documentation related to an API (like a Postman collection).</li><li>Links to status pages, official documentation, and examples.</li><li>Locations of credentials.</li><li>Points of contact for API consumers in each department.</li></ul><p>You can use an existing solution to create the catalog, though the space is mostly filled with API management platforms designed around providing internal APIs to your teams. Alternately, you can build your own solution or add the functionality to a tool you already use. This catalog is essentially a content management system (CMS) that stores the necessary information about each API as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Make the process of registering APIs to the catalog easy—or even automatic—for developers, as it will increase the adoption of the centralized hub.</p><h2 id="defining-api-selection-guidelines">Defining API Selection Guidelines</h2><p>How does your organization select which APIs to implement? Does each team—or developer—make decisions on their own? Is there an approval process? Are there restrictions on what kinds of APIs makes it into production? What about SLA requirements?</p><p>These questions, and others like them, are the foundation for defining a set of API selection guidelines. In many cases, you will be starting from a point of existing API dependencies. This is a good time to assess the landscape. Poll your teams, collect the data, and organize it. While existing APIs can be excluded from a selection policy, it is good to at least compare them to the guidelines you set. Start by defining the criteria that new APIs will need to meet. These criteria can include:</p><ul><li>A minimum set of SLA requirements (uptime guarantees, time to response, etc.).</li><li>Deprecation timelines and versioning details.</li><li>Cost vs. Value: Are there alternatives at lower costs? Is it worth it to build instead of buy?</li><li>Cross-team impact: Will an API be useful to more than one part of the organization.</li><li>Support availability: Does the price come with reliable support, both for the development with and management of the API?</li><li>Stack compatibility: What stacks have SDKs, and what would it take to continue using the API if your stack changes?</li><li>Ease of use and depth of documentation.</li><li>Data policy: Whether handling GDPR compliance or HIPPA laws, an API’s data policy has a direct impact on your own data management.</li></ul><h2 id="enforcing-governance-and-adding-value-to-your-organization">Enforcing governance and adding value to your organization</h2><p>With a catalog set up, and guidelines in place, enforcement keeps the process going. It’s important to establish a set of processes that doesn’t limit your teams ability to experiment and work efficiently, but also protects your organization from the shadow APIs that suddenly appear in your stack. Make sure the approval cycle is low-friction and the monitoring of new and existing APIs makes it easy to track usage.</p><p>Governance is a way to bring structure to your organization’s dependence on APIs, but it shouldn’t be yet another piece of technical debt. The good news is you don’t need to dive all-in right away. Simply starting to monitor API usage and performance across the organization as a whole is an excellent first step. At <a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a>, part of our offering helps with this by automatically monitoring API calls and organizing them in a central dashboard. This is one way to quickly view which APIs you are using effectively and monitor them from a performance, SLA, and anomaly standpoint. Explore ways to tie governance into your existing processes. The catalog can even live in your team’s internal knowledge base.</p><p>Take the first step toward adding more observability and oversight to the APIs that your organization uses. Set up a policy and implement the appropriate tooling to control and enforce the policy. This will help build a culture around scrutinizing and monitoring API dependencies and improve the overall resilience of your applications.<br></p>

 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 July 2020</strong></label></p><p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Near the end of 2019 I stumbled across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbK7PYQux4&amp;t=6m57s">talk</a> by procedural generation researcher <a href="https://www.anastasiaopara.com/">Anastasia Opara</a>. In the talk she presents a novel algorithm for example based texture synthesis. The goal of example based texture synthesis is to take one or more example textures and synthesize a new visually similar output texture.    </p>
<p>Here's an example from the project README:
  </p><p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/readme-example.jpeg" width="70%"> 
</p> 
<p>I was really curious about this algorithm and wanted to see if I could make it run faster as an exercise in profiling.  </p>
<p><strong>Embarking on a Journey</strong><br>
While I'm not going to go into great detail about how the algorithm works (see Anastasia's talk if you're curious!) it's helpful to understand the basic idea.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/synthesis-diagram.png" width="80%"> 
</p>

<div><p>We start with an empty output image and seed it with a few random pixels from our example images.<br>
Then repeat the following procedure until the output image is filled: </p><p> 
1. Choose an empty pixel in the output image. We will call this the center pixel.<br>
2. Find the k closest non empty pixels to the center in the output image. Note in the first few steps there might be fewer than k pixels in the entire output image. The locations of these k pixels relative to the center pixel define a neighborhood.<br>
3. Come up with a list of the most promising neighborhoods in the example image(s)<br>
4. Compare the most promising candidate neighborhoods in the example image(s) to the neighborhood around the center pixel and pick the most similar one.<br>
5. Fill the center pixel in the output image with the color of the center pixel in the best matching neighborhood.  </p></div>
<p>One last important detail is that the algorithm works on filling multiple empty pixels in parallel to take full advantage of multi core cpus.  </p>
<p><strong>Missteps and Micro optimizations</strong><br>
Now it was time to optimize. The first thing I did was to run the program on a few sample inputs with the xcode instruments profiler (partly because it was new to me). I even found a cool <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/b20eca/introducing_cargoinstruments_zerohassle_profiling/">library</a> which made it easier to use instruments with rust. Using instruments I was able to see how much each instruction contributed to the overall runtime of the program.  </p>
<p>Being able to see time per instruction was perfect for me because I was looking for micro optimizations. I'm using the term micro optimization here to mean a very small change which has a relatively large impact compared to its size. Even though they are not always a good idea, micro optimizations seemed like the best place to start because they would be less of an investment on my end. I also didn't know if the project maintainers would be excited about large code changes.  </p>
<p>Looking at the profiler output I was drawn to this line which looked like an unnecessary array resize operation nested within our once per pixel loop.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/first-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note about interpreting the numbers above is that this algorithm runs in several passes and is divided among multiple threads. The image above only shows one pass which accounts for about 12.6% of the runtime of the entire program. However each pass contains the highlighted instruction and behaves similarly. To get a rough estimate of the true impact of this instruction these percentages should be multiplied by a factor of about 8 (100/12.6). So the highlighted instruction really accounts for about 9.5% of the total program runtime.</p>
<p>After I eliminated the unnecessary array resize instruction I ran the program through the profiler again which seemed to confirm that it had gotten about 10% faster which I figured was pretty good for a first try. Of course, the profiler adds some overhead to the program, so to truly confirm that my optimization worked I needed to run it on a couple of examples without any profiling. When I did this I was shocked to see no improvement. </p>
<p>So what was happening? It turns out the cargo-instruments command I was running compiled the program in <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-does-cargo-build-not-optimise-by-default/4150">debug mode by default</a> which turned off significant optimizations. When I built the program in release mode the unnecessary array resize was automatically removed. I learned two very important lessons from this: First, of all when you benchmark you have to think carefully about what exactly you're benchmarking. Secondly, the compiler is smart and makes some micro optimizations for you.  </p>
<p>A little embarrassed and somewhat defeated, I went back to the drawing board.  </p>
<p>I grabbed a couple more profiles making sure this time to use release mode. After poking around some more I found that a significant amount of time was being spent loading pixels from the source images into intermediate buffers which were later used for neighborhood comparisons step of the algorithm.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/second-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>Again using the same runtime adjustment from the last profiling section this function seemed to take about 37.6% of the total runtime. I suspected cache misses were a significant contributor here, but regardless of the actual problem source I knew that reading the neighborhood pixels for each candidate was expensive.   </p>
<p>Of course the algorithm still needed to do the candidate neighborhood comparisons so I couldn't completely eliminate reading each candidate's neighborhood pixels. Luckily for me there was already a related optimization in the project,</p>
<p>This related optimization targeted the actual comparison step when finding a best candidate neighborhood. In the comparison step each candidate neighborhood was assigned a score by summing up the differences (always positive) between it's pixels and the target's neighborhood pixels. It turned out that often you could stop summing up these differences early if you already knew this current candidate's score was going to be higher than the best candidate's score so far.   </p>
<p>Once I understood this I just extended the idea to avoid reading the pixels needed for the unnecessary comparisons by removing the intermediate buffers and reading pixels only as they were needed which seemed to greatly reduce the average number of reads. I tested my optimization on a few different laptops with several output sizes using references images from the repository as inputs. It seemed like I had improved performance by around 15-25% depending on the output texture size, reference images and the computer I was using.  </p>
<p>Quantifying performance impact was a lot harder than I thought it would be. There were so many different parameters to the program that could affect performance: size of the reference image(s), size of the output images, number of threads. Hardware differences were also a huge factor. If I were really being rigorous I would have tried to put together a large collection of images and output sizes to benchmark off of. Due to time and budget constraints I did not assemble a super rigorous benchmark but my appreciation for the problem of performance testing has grown tremendously.  </p>
<p>Once I was confident that my micro optimization worked I made my <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/69">first pull request</a>. It was accepted but to my surprise the performance gains that the reviewers saw were not nearly as good as the ones I did. When one of them benchmarked it on an AMD Threadripper (with 64 virtual cores) the speed up was so small it might have just been noise.  </p>
<p><strong>Blocking And Locking</strong>  </p>
<p>At this point I decided to use some Google Cloud free trial credits I had lying around to spin up some larger machines to test on. Using a 64 core machine I noticed that just like on the thread ripper I didn't see much of a performance improvement from my micro optimization. I tried multiple tests with different numbers of threads (from 0 up to 64) and saw that as the number of threads increased the performance gain from my optimization dropped.  </p>
<p>So in my mind there were two explanations. First was that my optimization didn't save as much time when there were multiple threads. Second was that there was another source of latency which increased with the number of threads and that simply got so big it drowned out any noticeable effects of my optimization. It turned out this second explanation was correct.  </p>
<p>The additional source of latency turned out to be thread contention. To get the k nearest neighbors for each candidate pixel the algorithm was using a data structure called an r*tree. An r*tree provides a way to efficiently store points for nearest neighbor lookups. Exactly how an r*tree works is not actually super important here. The problem was that there was only one r*tree shared across the entire image. To prevent race conditions the r*tree had been wrapped in a read-write lock. This type of lock allows parallel reads but writes must happen in series. Reads also cannot occur while a write is in progress. With large numbers of threads, writing became a large bottleneck. Looking at a graph of program runtime versus number of cores also helps illustrate this effect.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/before-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>What I realized is that after a few pixels had been filled in the chance that one of the k nearest neighbors would be super far away from the candidate pixel was negligible. So I broke the images in to a grid of r*trees. The basic idea was that writes in two close cells could still block but writes in two far away cells could now be done in parallel. More details can be dound in <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/70">my second pull request</a>. To see the improvement from this change we can look at this graph below of synthesis speeds before / after:</p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/after-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note here is that the improved version does not scale linearly either. In an ideal world maybe it would but there are several complicating factors that are at play here. First of all the program has some initialization costs as well as having to synthesize the first few pixels in series. Both of these steps cannot be parallelized. Secondly contention is complicated and can crop up in many places. I believe I did eliminate a large source of contention but I'm sure there is more that could be done. Finally this algorithm is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> and will ultimately have to have some amount of informtion shared between threads.</p>

<hr>



<p>A team lead’s main concerns are team performance, interactions with other teams, and delivering projects on time.</p>



<p>Team leads should not be a bottleneck. You shouldn’t assign the most important and/or most complex tasks to yourself. You shouldn’t tie all processes to yourself.</p>



<p>Trust and acceptance of failures is the best way to eliminate yourself as a bottleneck. You should allow teammates to make mistakes, but it’s also important to be in control of how crucial mistakes will be.</p>



<p>As a team lead, you should trust your teammates and give them challenging and meaningful tasks. They need to feel their importance. By challenging them, you create growth opportunities. No one wants to be bored with tedious tasks all the time.</p>



<p>Look for a balance. Tasks that are too challenging can make the programmer question their confidence. Too many challenges will put them under unhealthy constant stress.</p>



<p>With self-doubts and stress, a member of your team will work on their tasks exponentially slower than they could with confidence and a good mood.</p>



<p>You can offer help when you notice that your teammate is struggling. Watch for signs from their mood. The simple question “How are things going?” is a tool to spot the problems.</p>



<p>By listening to your colleagues about their troubles and obstacles, you help them relieve their tension and regain their feeling of confidence. And if you can offer advice on how to solve the problem, that’s even better!</p>



<p>Pairing up with a colleague in trouble is another way to unblock the project.</p>



<p>By not burdening yourself with important projects with tight deadlines, you create time. Use this time to:</p>



<ul><li>Be conscious of the current state of your team members</li><li>Be available to offer help</li><li>Think about processes, what is working, and what is not</li><li>Think about current, upcoming, and past projects</li></ul>



<p>A good team lead does the following:</p>



<ul><li>Assigns important, challenging projects to teammates</li><li>Assigns blocking tasks to teammates</li><li>Is available to listen and offer help to teammates</li><li>Has time to be aware of the current state of team members</li><li>Has time to reflect on processes and projects</li></ul>

<p><strong>Can Audio Deepfakes Really Fake a Human?</strong></p>
<p>Audio deepfakes are the new frontier for business compromise schemes and are becoming more common pathways for criminals to deceptively gain access to corporate funds. Nisos recently investigated and obtained an original attempted deepfake synthetic audio used in a fraud attempt against a technology company. The deepfake took the form of a voicemail message from the company’s purported CEO, asking an employee to call back to “finalize an urgent business deal.” The recipient immediately thought it suspicious and did not contact the number, instead referring it to their legal department, and as a result the attack was not successful.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nisos investigated the phone number the would-be attacker used and determined it was a VOIP service with no owner registration information. It was likely simply acquired and used as a “burner” for this fraud attempt only. While there was no actual voicemail message associated with the number, we made no attempt for live contact with the owner of the phone number for legal reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Deepfake Audio Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Nisos analyzed the deepfake voicemail audio recording with an audio spectrogram tool called Spectrum3d. Looking to detect any anomalies, we immediately noticed the highs spiking repeatedly in the spectrogram (see graphic below). We initially suspected the deepfake creator used audio playing over on multiple channels to help mask the voice.</p>
<p><strong><i><img src="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=351&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png" alt="pasted image 0 (7)" width="351" srcset="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=176&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 176w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=351&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 351w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=527&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 527w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=702&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 702w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=878&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 878w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=1053&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"></i></strong><strong><i>Graphic 1: Spectrogram analysis of the deepfake audio, displaying major inconsistencies in pitch and tone.</i></strong></p>
<p>We additionally noticed the audio was very choppy and not consistent with a similar human voice recording. When we altered the audio speed and played back at 1.2 speed, the audio then sounded more like a standard text to speech system. Most interesting, when we amplified the sound to detect any background noise we were unable to find any traces, which further indicated this was manipulated audio.</p>
<p>We then compared the deepfake spectrogram analysis with results of a "normal" human voice on a similar recording. We can immediately see how the pitch and tone is more smoothed out, as well as the ability to detect faint background noise.</p>
<p><strong><i><img src="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=351&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png" alt="unnamed (4)" width="351" srcset="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=176&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 176w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=351&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 351w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=527&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 527w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=702&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 702w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=878&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 878w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/unnamed%20(4).png?width=1053&amp;name=unnamed%20(4).png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"></i></strong><strong><i>Graphic 2: Spectrogram analysis of ‘normal’ human voice, displaying more consistent pitch and tone.</i></strong></p>
<p>We were unable to determine the exact software or voice model used to create this deepfake as we would have required access to a large enough sample of the attacker’s other deepfake audio files (we would likely need tens if not hundreds of files, and this assumes the attacker made more than just this one). However, we note several complicating factors an actor would have to overcome to create a more realistic deepfake audio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capturing high quality audio with little to no background noise.</li>
<li>Staging the call for audio delivering in a realistic scenario (tone of the person talking, background noise and reason for the call) in which the person wouldn’t feel the need to call the person back.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Finding a way to leave a message, so they can avoid an in-person conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely the attacker in this scenario above utilized a feature most cell/VOIP service providers offer, which is the ability to bypass the ring option and go straight into the voice mail using the `#` key.</p>

<p><strong>Has This Happened Before?</strong></p>
<p>The most famous use of deep fake synthetic audio technology in criminal fraud was a September 2019 incident involving a British energy company. The criminals reportedly used voice-mimicking software to imitate the British executive’s speech and trick his subordinate into sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to a secret account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The managing director of this company, believing his boss was on the phone, followed orders to wire more than $240,000 to an account in Hungary.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Symantec security researchers reported in February on three cases of audio deepfakes used against private companies by impersonating the voice of the business’s CEO.<sup>2 </sup>The criminals reportedly trained machine learning engines from audio obtained on conference calls, YouTube, social media updates and even TED talks, to copy the voice patterns of company bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They created audio deepfakes replicating the CEO’s voice and called senior members of the finance department to ask for funds to be sent urgently. There was no additional reporting on which companies these were, whether the techniques were successful, or whether Symantec was able to obtain recordings of the deepfakes themselves.</p>
<p>Without actual digital capture of the audio, and additional forensics analysis, it is unclear whether these attempts were in fact deepfake synthetic manipulated audio. Regardless, the ability to generate synthetic audio extends an e-criminal’s toolkit and the criminal at the end of the day still has to effectively use social engineering tactics to induce someone into taking an action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminals and potentially broader nation state actors also learn from each other, so as these high-profile cases gain more notoriety and success, we anticipate more illicit actors trying them and learning from others who have paved the way.</p>
<p>Additionally, as deepfakes become easier to create or purchase, and the quality of synthetic manipulation -both audio (and video)- increases, we anticipate wider deployment of these e-crime exploits. If a fraud operation requires the use of a completely fake doctored video or audio for maximum impact, and it is worth the money and resources, it will be used. However, Nisos researchers have not seen the ability to easily outsource this type of deepfake for single individual or mass production.</p>
<p>Our researchers have contact with a few deepfake channels where we asked about this type of attack vector and participants were unsure something like this would be possible in the near future. The central issue with audio deepfakes has to do with capturing not only the person’s tone but also specific speech mannerisms. Future scenarios will likely materialize, however, where tools similar to a Yandex reverse image search (but for voice) could be used to gather numerous samples and then build and train a model that could help convert the source voice into the target voice.</p>

<p><strong>What Can Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>The most immediate action an employee can take, if they sense something suspicious in a voicemail (or any audio) instruction, is to call the person back directly using a known number and get them on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake technology is not sophisticated enough to mimic an entire phone call with someone. Additionally, the company can exercise a series of ‘challenge questions’ using information that is not publicly known or conversation points that an actor could not readily answer, to vet the identity of the individual on the line.</p>
<p>This fraud scheme is a form of a business email compromise (a more sophisticated and AI-developed version) where typically the attacker will pretend to be a senior executive at a company and get a more susceptible ‘lower-level’ employee to send money to a bank account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would anticipate a deepfake audio would be the first step in a series of social engineering attempts to get an employee to wire money to a specific location. Phishing emails, additional phone calls, or even deepfake videos purporting to authorize an action could be used in furtherance of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake audio may also be used for reasons ancillary to the ones listed above. For example, criminals can leave fake messages instructing employees to provide network or physical access to the company, allowing attackers to easily compromise the network or physical assets of the company.</p>
<p>The availability of this nascent but rapidly-emerging technology emphasizes the criticality with which companies must develop security practices that encompass these measures. Any time an unusual incident occurs, and certainly when large financial transactions are involved, employees should be trained to ask challenge questions to senior executives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a first-time manager to get a single direct report. Try it out. See how it goes. Here’s what this ends up looking like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If they give feedback that their manager stinks, that’s 100% bad feedback from your reports. If the report doesn’t do well, that’s 100% of your reports that aren’t succeeding.* If the report quits, you just lost your whole team.</li>
  <li>The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. It also regularly leads to micromanagement.</li>
  <li>The single report is isolated. They don’t have any peers on the team to reach out to for help. If their manager is bad, they don’t have any corroborating voices. Anything that goes wrong is a they-said I-said debate. Any debate inside of the team is a faceoff with your manager.</li>
  <li>No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. A report could look to teammates to corroborate or dissuade their ideas. With one report, disagreements have little additional evidence, so people have to either approach the situation with a supreme lack of ego, or they can just assume it’s the other person’s fault. Guess which option happens most.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. This compounds the issue. Straight-from-college hires don’t have great context for what it means to be in industry, to have a manager, to work a job with no end-of-semester in sight. And hires aren’t expected to have as much autonomy in their formative early years. With these variables, the requirements on the manager are higher than average.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, consider doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html">anti-pattern</a> for more reasons than just this one.</li>
  <li>Try and make sure the manager of a team with 1 individual contributor is also an expert in the domain area. Sometimes managers are explicitly not the domain expert by design, but when you have 1 report, a lack of domain expertise is one of the sure-fire ways to make mistakes and a sure-fire way for your report to get the idea that you’re no good.</li>
  <li>Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Note: mangers should be very invested in their report’s success. But when the manager is <em>over-invested</em> it leads to all sorts of unsavory things, some of which are called out above. Another example is when a report is doing well-enough, but because the manager is <em>over-reliant</em> on their performance, they try to push the report beyond what they can or want to do.</p>

<p>In today’s post we’re going to talk about latencies in a common distributed
system architecture: The root-leaf, or parent-child, fanout architecture. We’ll
try to gain an intuition for what drives tail latency, derive a formula for
tying together the parent and child latency distributions, and provide a useful
interactive visualization to help understand tail latency in these systems.</p>

<h3 id="root-leaf-fanout-architecture">Root-Leaf Fanout Architecture</h3>

<p>When dealing with distributed systems, it’s a common pattern to have a root
aggregator node that fans-out requests to many leaf nodes that do work in
parallel, then send back their response to the root node to aggregate and
create a final response. Usually the API of the system is exposed through the
root-aggregator nodes, so the latency of these root nodes is what matters.</p>

<p>As seasoned distributed system developers, we know that latency (and
performance) is a
<a href="https://medium.com/lightstephq/performance-is-a-shape-not-a-number-a3c1a9ae19cc">shape not a number</a>.
What this means is that we shouldn’t concern ourselves solely with what the
average latency of a service is – we care about the full latency distribution
– and at the very least we should care about the tail. Usually people settle on
monitoring the $90^{th}$ or $99^{th}$ percentile (p90 or p99), and maybe use a
heatmap to visualize the whole latency distribution.</p>

<p>In the case of our parent-aggregator and many children setup, if we’re going to
concern ourselves with its p99 latency, it’d be nice to know for a given fanout,
how fast do our children nodes have to be to get a certain p99 parent
latency. This is also useful when debugging, but in reverse. If I see a p95
latency spike for the parent node, what percentile latency on the children nodes
do I need to care about? How does this change with the fanout size?</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the Problem</h3>

<p>Before we analyze the problem any further, we should first define exactly what
problem we’re analyzing. In its simplest form, the parent-child system has two
defining properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parent latency for a request is greater than or equal to the max of all the children latencies, since the parent must wait for all child responses.</li>
<li>Child latency inevitably has a long tail.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>These two properties mean that as we fan out to more children, our parent
latency will get worse, because we’re more likely to hit a long tail latency
event. And conversely if we can reduce our fanout or reduce the variance in our
child latency we’ll be able to drive down our overall latency.</p>

<p>What’s not immediately obvious though is the magnitude of the effect of reducing
fanout or improving child latency variance is. To try to gain some
understanding, let’s consider a situation where the child latency follows a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log normal distribution</a>
with $\mu = 3$ and $\sigma = 0.2$ and consider the latency distributions of the
child, and parents who fan out to varying number of children per request: 10,
100, 1000.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Now we’ll visualize the reconstructed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density functions</a>
based on observations from generated data, for both the children and the parents:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-child-parent-pdfs-density-plot.png" title="Density plot of child and parent latency probability density functions"></p>

<p>What’s immediately obvious is that as the fanout increases, the parent latency distribution gets worse and worse, and is dominated by the tail latency of the children. By the time we’re fanning out to 1000 children, the parent latency distribution looks almost completely unrelated to the child latency distribution. While we could have predicted this, hopefully this visualization helps build up our intuition of the problem.</p>

<h3 id="deriving-a-closed-form-solution">Deriving a Closed Form Solution</h3>

<p>We began this adventure trying to answer a question, and now it is time to return to it: <em>What child latency percentile drives a given parent latency percentile?</em></p>

<p>Although the problem is pretty simple, I wrestled with it a bit until a friend
pointed out that you can think of a percentile latency as not describing a point
in the latency distribution but instead as a <em>probability</em> that a request
finishes in a given amount of time. So if the p90 latency is 10ms, we can
reframe this as saying that the probability a request finishes within 10ms is
$90\%$.</p>

<p>When we combine this insight with the fact that a parent request only finishes
once all its children requests finish, we can derive a closed form solution to
our problem.</p>

<p>Since the parent request finishes only after all $N$ children requests finish,
then the probability the parent request finishes in time $t$, is the probability
that all $N$ children finish in time $t$. Assuming all children latencies are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
then we can calculate the parent probability as:</p>

<p>$$
P_{parent\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs} = (P_{child\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs})^N
$$</p>

<p>which when we solve for child latency percentile gives us the following formula:</p>

<p>$$
P_{child} \approx \sqrt[N]{P_{parent}}
$$</p>

<p>Now that we have a formula for our problem, we can begin inspecting some
secnarios. If we cared about the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
and the fanout was to 2 children, then we would need to care about the
$94.86^{th}$ percentile at the children, since $\sqrt{0.9} \approx 0.9486$.</p>

<p>One thing about this formula that can be surprising, is how quickly the child
percentile we have to care about grows as we increase the fanout. Even fanning
out to 20 children, and monitoring the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
we need to care about the $99.47^{th}$ percentile latency of the children!</p>

<p>The graph below shows how quickly $50^{th}$, $90^{th}$, and $99^{th}$ parent
percentile latency converges to being driven by the $100^{th}$ percentile child
latency as fanout size grows.</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout"></p>

<p>Here is a zoomed-in view focusing on the $90^{th}$ percentile and above:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile-zoomed.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout Zoomed"></p>

<p>We can see that if we’re monitoring the p90 latency of the parent, by the time we fan out to 10 children, we’ll have to start caring about the p99 latency of the children.</p>

<h3 id="trust-but-verify-and-visualize">Trust, but Verify (and Visualize)</h3>

<p>Although the formula makes sense, and the intuition behind it sounds reasonable<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, I often find it helpful when confronted with a formula to verify its correctness by simulation. So I below is a little simulation and visualization to do just that. <strong>The main spiffiness comes when you hover over a bar in either distribution</strong>, as the visualization will highlight both the percentile in its distribution as well as highlight the corresponding percentile in the other distribution:</p>






<p>The above is an example visualization generated from a generalized tool, simulating 3000 requests to a parent fanning out to 20 children, where the child latency distribution is a log normal distribution with $\mu = 3.4$ and $\sigma = 0.3$. The tool itself is <a href="https://paulcavallaro.com/standalone/fanouts.html">hosted here</a>, and the code is in this <a href="https://github.com/paulcavallaro/fanouts-and-percentiles">github repo</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can use this visualization to confirm our formula empirically. If we hover over the bar that correlates with the p95 latency in the parent distribution, our formula predicts that the child latency it corresponds to should be $\sqrt[20]{0.95} \approx .9974$ or p99.74, which is roughly what I get.</p>

<h3 id="bach-s-fanout-variations">Bach’s Fanout Variations</h3>

<p>While we now have a nice way to reason about and visualize the simplest version
of the problem, there are still many variations that would be useful to understand.</p>

<p>Here are some things we might want to do to our system to improve the overall latency:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happens if we drop the slowest child request?</li>
<li>What happens if we retry the slowest child request if it takes “too long”?</li>
<li>What happens if we send every child request to two children instead and just use the fastest response?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the first person to think about this, lots of the ideas in this section
are stolen directly from the
<a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub40801">Tail at Scale</a>, as well as things
I’ve observed in the wild.</p>

<p>This is a pretty rich topic, so hopefully in the future I can revisit it and
update the visualization to take account of these subtleties.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The repositories of distributions such as <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nixpkgs</a> are among the
<a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">largest</a> collections of open source (and some unfree) software. They
are complex systems that connect and organize many interdependent packages.
Interestingly, these systems grow out of the individual design choices of
thousands of contributors but few of them have larger design goals in mind.</p>
<p>Is it possible to capture the large scale features of such a repository in an
image? Are there common design choices of the contributors? Did they lead to
any emergent structure?</p>
<p>Plenty of studies (e.g. <a href="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/2008-TOSEM-PowerLaws/html/LSV08.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>, or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have examined these questions
from different viewpoints and for various software ecosystems. In this blog
post I’ll try to shed some light on them from the perspective of Nixpkgs,
mostly with visualizations of its complete dependency graph but also with a
very short examination of its statistical properties (its degree distribution).
But wait, you might think: “visualizing a graph with 50000 nodes and 300000
edges? - All you are going to see is black!“. Well, it turns out that this is
not the case because large scale structures appear when we look at the graph in
the right way.</p>
<h2>An overview of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Before explaining in detail what I did, let’s start with a teaser. Check out
the structure in this fascinating image where each little dot represents a
single software package in the Nixpkgs repository:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>What looks remotely like the section of a mouse brain actually represents
around 46000 software packages. Each dot in this image corresponds to a
different one, more precisely to a Nix derivation in the Nixpkgs repository.
Each package is invisibly linked to those that it depends on (ingoing
dependencies) or those that depend on it (outgoing dependencies). These
packages are the nodes, and their invisible links the incoming and outgoing
edges of the directed dependency graph of Nixpkgs.</p>
<p>The total number of dependencies that a node has is called the node’s <em>degree</em>.
It is subdivided in the <em>in degree</em> which counts the number of ingoing
dependencies and the <em>out degree</em> which counts the number of outgoing
dependencies. I have colored and sized the nodes in the above image by their in
degree: a brighter larger node means that more derivations depend on it (high
in degree) than on a darker smaller node (low in degree). Size and color are
scaled non-linearly and should only be interpreted qualitatively. We will see
later from the distribution of these degrees why this makes sense.</p>
<p>The graph was laid out and visualized with the program <a href="https://gephi.org/">gephi</a> using a
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679">force simulation algorithm</a> to project each node to a display
positions in the image. This force model consists of attractive and repulsive
forces that drag the nodes into their final positions that you can see in the
image.</p>
<p>The attractive force pulls nodes towards their dependencies. Therefore nodes
with similar dependencies end up close to each other. Looking back at the
image, we see the effect of this force in the form of node clusters with
visible gaps between them. The repulsive force pushes nodes away from
dependencies that have high degree. High degree nodes therefore appear with a
lot of space around them. Low degree nodes, on the other hand, are tightly
packed.</p>
<p>As a final addition, a gravitational force keeps the whole graph together and
squeezes it into roughly circular form. Check out the appendix at the end of
this post for a detailed explanation, including the code and the data that are
required to reproduce this image yourself.</p>
<p>The following image of the dependency graph was laid out in the same way, but
shows the package name of each node explicitly. As before, the package names
are scaled non-linearly with the in degree of the node. The names of the
largest nodes - we’ll call them hub nodes - are well readable but to read the
labels of the smaller nodes you should click on the image and use your browsers
zoom functionality.</p>

<p>Most central to the Nixpkgs repository are the primary hub nodes <em>bash</em> and the
Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation. Unsurprisingly, most derivations depend on them - at
least at build time - because <em>bash</em> is one of the most commonly used Unix
shells and <em>stdenv</em> is a nix package that groups very fundamental build
dependencies such as GNU make. Both are used as default environments in Nix.</p>
<p>Slightly smaller secondary hub nodes can also be identified:
<em>curl</em> and <em>mirrors-list</em> seem to be central to the upper part of the graph and
indicate that it has something to do with the internet. On the right side,
<em>Python2.7</em> and <em>Python3.6</em> are visible as distinct clusters and grouped around
a central <em>hook</em> derivation that is used by Nix to setup a Python environment.
On the left side, different versions of Perl can be seen. In the bottom, the
Linux library manager tool <em>pkg-config</em> forms a little aura that matches its
importance for the open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>The hub nodes indicate that some clusters in this graph correspond to the
environments of different programming languages. Naturally packages in these
environments will have a common set of dependencies and therefore appear close
to each other in the graph.</p>
<h2>Ego networks: exploring hub node environments</h2>
<p>Let’s dive further into this. A hub node forms a little subgraph together with
its ingoing and outgoing dependencies that is sometimes called its <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/networks/egonet.htm"><em>ego network</em></a>
(this term seems to originate in studies of social networks). In the following
plot, the ego networks of a few selected hub nodes are colored in green. The
corresponding hub node’s name is indicated above each subplot. It illustrates
nicely how clusters form around a compiler, an interpreter or just an important
tool:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The ego networks confirm our previous intuition that some clusters correspond
to different programming languages. They also provide basic orientation on this
graph. Here is a short description of the different ego networks:</p>
<p>Most of the upper part of the graph is dominated by <em>curl</em>. Closer inspection
shows that most of these derivations are archives such as <em>.tar.gz</em> files or
language specific archives such as <em>.gem</em> files. These archives are downloaded
from the internet before other packages are derived from them. Another large,
but less tightly packed region is the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. It dominates the
bottom of the graph and it is characterized by lots of smaller hub nodes
indicating that <em>pkg-config</em> organizes many packages that are important for
other packages. The ego network of <em>cmake</em> is mixed into a similar region of
the graph.</p>
<p>Python2.7 and Python3.6 form neat clusters with three central hub nodes that
correpond to the python interpreter, the package management tool <em>pip</em>, and the
build and installation tool <em>setuptools</em>. Python2.7 is used more often by
packages outside of its cluster than Python3.6. In contrast to Python, Perl has
only a single hub node for each specific version but it forms similarly dense
clusters. From the different Perl versions, <em>Perl-5.28.0</em> is reused most outside
of its own cluster by a lot of other packages in the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. This
indicates that the specific version of the Nixpkgs repository that I have
evaluated uses this particular Perl version as the default for other packages.</p>
<p>Lisp (sbcl), Haskell (ghc), Ruby, OCaml, Go, and Rust derivations also
accumulate in tight clusters around their respective compiler.</p>
<p>Ego networks can only give a glimpse into the structure of the graph of
Nixpkgs. Not all environments are organized around a central hub. Some packages
are self-contained and independent. For example, the Go
packages form a tight independent group because they <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26217488/what-is-vendoring">often include copies of third party packages that they depend on</a>.
There are also many smaller clusters that correspond to particular tools such
as terraform, maven or even the vim plugins. If you have time and patience, you
can try to find them in the labelled graph image above.</p>
<h2>The degree distribution of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Another perspective on the global properties of the Nixpkgs repository is the
degree distribution of its nodes. It shows how many nodes exist with a certain
in or out degree (as a reminder: the in degree is the number of packages that
depend on the node; the out degree is the number of packages that the node
depends on). Certainly there are a lot more nodes with low in degree than with
high in degree. More interesting is how the number of nodes with a
certain degree changes between the extremes.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of studies (for example
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have found that the in degree
distribution of software repository dependencies follows a power-law
distribution, similar to the degree distributions of networks in Geology,
Biology, Economics, or the Internet
(<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/courses/2006/cmplxsys899/powerlaws.pdf">here is a short introduction on power-laws</a>).
Such a power-law distribution can be generated by several mechanisms. The
hottest candidate mechanism in the case of software repositories seems to be
<em>preferential attachment</em>, a.k.a. “the rich get richer”. In other words, a new
package is more likely to depend on existing packages with a lot than on
packages with few dependencies. Other mechanisms such as <em>self-organized criticality</em>
<a href="https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/Downloads/ICSM-ICSME2007_EmpiricalEvidenceForSOCDynamicsInSoftwareEvolution.pdf">might also play a role</a>.</p>
<p>The (complementary) cumulative in and out degree distributions show how many
packages exist above a certain degree. Looking at the cumulative distribution
is typically better than looking at its derivative, the degree distribution. As
an integral, the cumulative distribution has a better behavior when the density
of packages gets low at high degrees. We plot it here for the in and
out degrees in log-log scale such that a power-law is just a straight line:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>The cumulative in degree distribution is a very clean power-law decay with an
exponent of -0.9. The in degree distribution itself has an exponent of -1.9,
because it is the derivative of the cumulative distribution. The value that we
observe falls in the range of values that have been …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>© 2020 Paolo Melchiorre <i>"Photo of Paolo Melchiorre speaking at EuroPython 2020 Online Edition"</i></p><div>
<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at the EuroPython 2020 Online Edition with title <a href="https://www.paulox.net/2020/07/23/europython-2020/#europython-2020/">“A pythonic full-text search”</a> which is now available here on my&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p><em>In the last few years I gave a lot of talks in various tech conferences in Europe, but it was my first talk in an online conference, so I decided to share some thoughts about this&nbsp;experience.</em></p>
<p>The EuroPython team did a great job organizing everything. They made a list of tips and a complete guide for speakers that I suggest, to organizers and speakers of other conferences, to&nbsp;read.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/europython-2020-social-online-card.jpg" title="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020" alt="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020"></p>
<p>ep2020.europython.eu/events/tips/</p>

<p>Besides reading the guide and attending the rehearsal session, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to have a good setup. I copied from other conference speakers, and to have a working virtual background in zoom, I used my two external monitors as light&nbsp;panels.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-00.jpg"></p>
<p>Attending an online conference is a new experience , but giving a talk remotely is way more strange than in a regular conference. There’s nobody around to speak with, smiles at or asking to take a picture, so I shoot by myself some pictures of me during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-01.jpg"></p>
<p>At the same time, I was able to capture some screenshots of myself giving the talk from the live Youtube channel, so I have a picture of me from the other side of the screen in the exact moment of the above&nbsp;picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-02.png"></p>
<p>In the speakers guide there was this suggestion: “Throw in some jokes. Even bad jokes. Even a really bad pun.”. I tried to make a joke about synchronization problems in full-text search, a very dangerous thing to do, but here I’m laughing at my own joke during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-03.png"></p>
<p>Another suggestion from the organizers was to use “Pictures instead of bullet points in slides. Pictures are great. Everyone loves cats.” so I&nbsp;used:</p>
<ul>
<li>an elephant (the logo of&nbsp;PostgreSQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-04.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a famous guitaris (Django Reinhardt from whom the Django web framework takes its&nbsp;name)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-05.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>some&nbsp;books</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-07.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a picture of me at EuroPython 2017 during the sprint on&nbsp;Django</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-06.jpg"></p>
<p>In an online conference people are more interactive and free to do other things watching your talk, so I published in advance a post on my blog with the slides and other information about the talk, and I shared a <span>QR</span>-code linked to it and also all my other&nbsp;contacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-08.png"></p>
<p>Giving online talks is a stressful thing, but answering questions is way more difficult, you are not able to see who is asking the question and its expression. In these pictures I was at the end of the talk after a few questions, waiting for an&nbsp;applause.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-09.jpg"></p>
<p>This was my first time giving a talk in an online conference, it was a very challenging experience but I enjoyed it. I learnt a lot of new stuff, also how to take a picture of myself after the talk, to share it&nbsp;online.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-10.jpg"></p>
<p>I’ll gave other talks this year, I listed them on my talks&nbsp;page:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paulox.net/talks/"><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/talks.jpg" title="All of my past and future talks, including links, slides, pictures and videos." alt="All of my past and future talks, including links, slides, pictures and videos."></a></p>
<p><strong>See you at the next&nbsp;conference!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                
    <span>Jul 2020</span>

    

    <p>Letâ€™s just skip the intro and get to the good stuff. Mmkay? Kay.</p>
<h2>1) Move â€œFind Allâ€� To The Bottom</h2>
<p>When you hit <em>Cmd+Shift+F</em> VS Codeâ€™s â€œFind Allâ€� panel shows up.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a super powerful feature. Itâ€™s one of the niceties that originally drew me away from Sublime Text in the first place.</p>
<p>WHY IN THE WORLD IS IT SCRUNCHED IN THE SIDEBAR!!??!</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1470600526.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The bottom panel thingy (where the terminal sits) is a much better place for â€œSearchâ€�.</p>
<p>This actually used to be the default in VS Code, and there was a setting to customize it yourself.</p>
<p>Now, they changed the default AND they removed the setting completely.</p>
<p>What are we to do?</p>
<p>Welp, turns out you can just drag it. Take a gander:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1353159485.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There we go. One annoyance down. Four to go.</p>
<h2>2) Better New Window Sizing</h2>
<p>This one might just be me, but when I open a new VS Code window, I expect it to be the same size as the previously opened one.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window in VS Code looks like with an existing window already opened by default:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3312027563.png" alt="">
Now, admittedly, this actually looks kind of cool, but nonetheless, it would make so much more sense if VS Code just used the last known window size as a reference.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we can add the following configuration to our <em>settings.json</em> file.</p>
<p>To open <em>settings.json</em>, search for â€œsettings jsonâ€� in the command palette (<em>Cmd+Shift+P</em>):
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3815150.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, you can add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "inherit",</code></pre>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window will look like now:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3355376318.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You might also prefer to keep the same dimensions, but â€œoffsetâ€� the new window. You can do that with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "offset",</code></pre>
<p>Now, the new window will be â€œoffsetâ€�:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/32369233.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3) Snippet Suggestions At The Top</h2>
<p>Snippets in VS Code are a powerful way to auto-fill repetitive boilerplate text. If you donâ€™t already use them, you can read more about them <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">here</a>.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know about you, but if I registered a trigger for a snippet, I want to see that snippet at the top of my autocomplete list. Otherwise, SNIPPETS ARE USELESS.</p>
<p>Snippets have to be fast and easy to trigger, and out of the box THEY ARE NOT.</p>
<p>Take the following example GIF of a <code>console.log</code> snippet with a trigger of <code>con</code>.</p>
<p>When I type <code>con</code> I should be able to hit <em>Enter</em> and fill <code>console.log</code>.
This is not the case: </p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2858044731.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>To remedy this, we can add a new setting to our <em>settings.json</em> file:</p>
<pre><code>"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top",</code></pre>
<p>Now, when I type <code>con</code>, my suggestions are more sensible:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/4146687846.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh, VS Codeâ€¦</p>
<h2>4) GitHub-Style Inline Diffs</h2>
<p>I LOVE VS Codeâ€™s diff viewer.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a great way to get a glimpse of your changes before a commit, or easily resolve a merge conflict.</p>
<p>However, the default diff viewer is â€œSide by Sideâ€�. Meaning there are two panels with two different versions of the same file open side by side:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/595731340.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I much prefer the way GitHub renders diffs inline:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1762674115.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can easily achieve this in VS Code with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"diffEditor.renderSideBySide": false,</code></pre>
<p>Now take a look at the diff editor in VS Code:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2616479419.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wehoo, love it ðŸ‘ŒðŸ�»</p>
<h2>5) Disable â€œPeekâ€� Previews</h2>
<p>Previews panels in VS Code are the most annoying thing ever.</p>
<p>So ugly and so useless.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever wanted to see a tiny preview of a file instead of just viewing the file itself. The previews are always too constrained anyways.</p>
<p>Look at this horribleness:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/597353947.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With a few settings we can improve our world and never see those disgusting things again!</p>
<pre><code>"editor.gotoLocation.multipleReferences": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDefinitions": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDeclarations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleTypeDefinitions": "goto",</code></pre>
<p>Ah, there we go, now we will actually go to the file itself right away. Much better.</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1392694127.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>VS Code has so many powerful features. Iâ€™m a happy user of it. However, there are lots of tiny little details it gets wrong.</p>
<p>If you dig these short little tips, I have an entire course FULL of them.</p>
<p>In the course, weâ€™ll completely overhaul your VS Code workflow and make you fast and efficient. Along the way weâ€™ll also make VS Code look and behave better.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>These days I turn to <a href="https://sharpend.io/recreational-programming-with-serverless/">recreational programming</a> more often than usual. Solving fun problems makes me feel less confused and helpless about the pandemic. It’s a coping mechanism and a good one at that.</p>

<p>One thing has been an especially surprising source of joy for me: <em>Rust</em>. Surprising because I’ve been known to have an on-off relationship with the programming language since its 1.0 release. I quit Rust more than once – both professionally and personally – mainly out of frustration with a subpar development experience and general lack of libraries.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’m thrilled that I gave Rust another chance this year.</p>

<h2 id="that-was-then">That was then</h2>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://sharpend.io/every-day-we-must-sweep/">I wrote</a> that “Rust lets you control almost everything, but as a beginner, it’s also hard to compile <em>anything</em>. As a result, Rust continues to make me look bad.” I was disappointed. Again.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working for a chaos engineering startup that chose Rust for simulating common server problems such as high CPU load, increased network latency, or random application crashes. A reasonable choice if your goal is to inject low-level faults in a predictable way, right? After all, Rust is said to be <a href="https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/">our best chance at safe systems programming</a>. That may very well be true.</p>

<p>However, back then, I didn’t think Rust was the best option for the client side of the product. The main reason was productivity – or rather the lack thereof.</p>

<p>In 2017, my day-to-day Rust experience boiled down to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing code in Vim with bare-bones syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>No code completion and no “go to definition” (the Rust Language Server was still in its infancy)</li>
  <li>Effectively no code formatting, since <code>rustfmt</code> just gave up whenever a line was too long (seriously)</li>
  <li>Docs were hard to find or non-existent</li>
  <li>The same goes for high-quality code examples</li>
  <li>No official Rust Docker images, homegrown CI pipelines only</li>
  <li>Compile times were noticeably slow, resulting in long <a href="https://sharpend.io/fast-feedback-is-everything/">feedback loops</a></li>
  <li>Speaking of feedback, Rust’s borrow checker made it difficult to understand why it rejected a piece of code and how to fix it</li>
</ul>

<p>All these drawbacks add up, but what really bothered me was the immature crate ecosystem. To give you one example, when we implemented the ability to inject faults into containers, we couldn’t find any usable Rust client library to talk to the Docker API, let alone Kubernetes. As a result, we were forced to reinvent the wheel several times (and sometimes ended up with a flat tire, in typical startup fashion).</p>

<p>In the face of these obstacles and despite my appreciation for its language design, I often found it challenging to get real work done with Rust.</p>

<p>At least, that was then.</p>

<p><img src="https://sharpend.io/assets/images/rust-gegenueber.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="this-is-now">This is now</h2>

<p>Today, three years later, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/05/15/five-years-of-rust.html">Rust has changed a lot</a>, and for the better! That became apparent to me when I recently had some extra time between freelance contracts and decided to <a href="https://sharpend.io/7-things-i-learned-from-porting-a-c-crypto-library-to-rust/">port a crypto library from C to Rust</a> (because that’s what I do to get out of the cloud consulting bubble once in a while).</p>

<p>I realized that the release of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html">2018 edition</a> is particularly noteworthy. It made the language much more productive in several ways: simpler syntax, a smarter borrow-checker, an improved module system, enhanced tooling (both <code>rustfmt</code> and Clippy, Rust’s linter, hitting 1.0), and a host of other features. Add to that IDE support, incremental compilation, excellent documentation, and immensely helpful error messages, and what you now get is nothing short of remarkable.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rust’s soaring popularity – it has been <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow’s most loved language</a> for four years in a row – finding a particular crate or tool has become easier (though still not necessarily easy). There are more and more <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">open source projects</a> to explore. There’s a growing list of third-party cargo subcommands (<a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-geiger">cargo-geiger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm">cargo-asm</a> being two of my favorites). There’s even <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">a decent REPL</a>. CI/CD <a href="https://actions-rs.github.io/">is a breeze</a>, and so is <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">cross compilation</a> to dozens of platforms. In short, there’s a lot to love here.</p>

<p>Given these advances, it’s no wonder that learning Rust is also quite different now. The tonari blog <a href="https://blog.tonari.no/why-we-love-rust">captured it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year after switching over to Rust, we onboarded our fourth engineer to the team, who didn’t have much prior experience in either Rust or systems engineering. While the learning curve is undeniable (borrow checker, my old friend), we’ve found that Rust is incredibly empowering for those new to lower-level programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Empowering</em> is the perfect word to describe Rust in 2020. What used to be a rough adventure with many pitfalls has turned into something beautiful, something that can lift your spirit. At least, that’s what it did for me.</p>

<p>I encourage you to immerse yourself in a little Rust project today. You might be in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been a global shift toward data-driven business. But, in many cases, the data just under the surface is dirty, and it’s failing modern companies.</p><p>In their<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/white-papers/2020-global-data-management-research.pdf"> <em>2020 Global data management research</em></a> report, Experian estimated that many businesses aiming for agile, data-driven approaches believe almost a third of their data to be inaccurate.</p><blockquote><em>“While the business wants to be agile and informed by data, this level of distrusted data often leads leaders to fall back on making decisions by gut instinct rather than by informed data insight.” Experian Global Managing Director of Data Quality Mike Kilander</em></blockquote><p>That doesn’t just mean a large chunk of the data the companies have isn’t working for them. It means their data is working <em>against </em>them—costing them money, frustrating their employees, and getting in the way of opportunities.</p><p>If you don’t take an active role in your data governance, your dirty data will snowball, picking up crud as it rolls forward. If left uncleaned, it can tarnish up to<a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64612-the-cost-of-bad-data-stats"> 70% of your data after one year</a>. This data erosion will directly impact your bottom line--as it does for<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 83% of companies</a>--and cost you an average of<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 23% of your revenue</a>.</p><p>Mature data governance is no longer a wish list item for modern companies. It’s table stakes, so much so that, according to the<a href="https://go.profisee.com/2019-state-of-data-management-report"> 2019 State of Data Management Report</a>, governance is one of the top five strategic initiatives for global companies.</p><p>To stop throwing your time and money out the window and make your data clean up and grow up, you need a mature, enterprise-wide data governance model.</p><p>These maturity models help companies ensure the data in their system is accurate, well understood, and supported by employees with the skill sets needed to turn numbers into narrative.</p><h2><strong>What Exactly Is Data Governance Maturity and Why Should You Care?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity refers to the level of data management process and optimization you have built into your business.</p><p>At a company with mature data governance, clean and formal data management is at the core of everything they do. Each employee, team lead, and department knows the best practices they’re supposed to follow, and the company’s projects are regularly measured and optimized using the data produced. This gold standard of a data-driven company actively optimizes its processes using the <strong>three main components of data governance:</strong></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Rules </strong>that dictate the creation and maintenance of data</li><li><strong>Enforcement </strong>that outlines how you ensure rules are followed throughout the company</li><li><strong>Management </strong>practices that are carried out by data stewards and employees in accordance with enforcement</li></ol><p>In its infancy, data governance maturity looks like reactive data management, ad-hoc data practices, a lack of formally defined best practices, and a kind of free-for-all approach to how data is collected, cleaned, and pruned. In short: it looks like chaos, where data is a byproduct of your company instead of the fuel behind its actions.</p><p>If you aren’t taking a proactive role in your data governance by measuring its maturity, you’re letting an information toddler run through an operational china shop—a dirty-data toddler that can wreck your company, leaving errors, inconsistencies, and security risks in its path.</p><p><em>“Poor data is often entangling entire organizations with crippling effects, preventing timely decision-making and negatively impacting customer experience.” — Experian 2020 Global data management research report</em></p><p>However, there’s no “one size fits all” approach to data governance, so you’ll have to work with your leaders and systems architects to tailor the framework that fits your use case and goals.</p><h2><strong>Which Data Governance Maturity Models Should You Use?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity models help you measure and understand how well you manage your data. When you have a clear understanding of your data governance, you’re better able to understand how you are or are not meeting goals, what steps you need to take to improve data management overall, and how you need to tailor data approaches to each team and project.</p><p>There are almost as many data governance maturity models as there are use cases for data. If you already use a maturity model to measure your data capabilities, it’s best to adjust that framework and apply it to your data governance to keep things consistent.</p><p>If, however, you’re starting from the ground level, you can choose from one of the many maturity assessments published by reputable vendors, each of which features a slightly different emphasis:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ii/whitepaper/LIW14003USEN.pdf"><strong>IBM</strong></a><strong> &amp;</strong><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/bg/en/pages/technology/articles/Data-management-maturity-self-assessment.html"><strong> Deloitte</strong></a> focus on process characterization across projects and enterprise levels and use the CMMI Institute’s Data Management Maturity (DMM) model.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-dataflux/"><strong>DataFlux</strong></a> focuses on people, risk, process, reward, technology adoption, and business capabilities.</li><li><a href="https://dattamza.org/dattamza-blog/data-governance-and-the-maturity-assessment-model"><strong>Dattamza</strong></a> focuses on process, technology capabilities, managed risk, financials, and people management.</li><li><a href="https://edmcouncil.org/page/aboutdcamreview"><strong>EDM Council</strong></a> focuses on the maturity of an organization’s structure, its policies and guidelines, and funding.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-kalido/"><strong>Kalido</strong></a><strong> </strong>focuses on the value of data as an enterprise asset and the risks and rewards of how it’s managed.</li></ul><p>All of the above feature some version of the level 1-5 system to rate the development stage of a company’s data governance.</p><p>For this article, we’ll focus on the IBM model, as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework that underpins it is one of the most popular—and oldest—ways of thinking about data governance maturity.</p><p>The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) was developed in 2006 by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University based on the earlier Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The CMM was originally developed to improve software dev processes, and its successor took its original principles and made them more broadly applicable to any enterprise using data.</p><h2><strong>IBM Data Governance Maturity Model</strong></h2><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model is one of the most widely used models around for measuring the maturity of data governance. Drawing from the creation of the CMMI in 2006, IBM released this model in 2007 to provide a clear, easy-to-understand, and tailored framework for measuring data maturity.</p><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model focuses on measuring 11 domains—such as value creation, policy, stewardship, information lifecycle management, and data architecture—using a maturity scale of 1-5. Most companies start out by focusing on the handful that are most relevant and important to them and then building out as their core domains become more mature.</p><h3><strong>The 5 levels of maturity</strong></h3><p>For each domain a company focuses on, the IBM Data Governance Maturity Model outlines five levels of maturity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f0630497ff87413654faabe_T2hZFW0T8EQNecms1z_IAs21zOeWR0GH86WjVAcxXzg-5mPW3etCgX8mjOkAIZGTVKtdKlIbEwbztZ2aF1lXTEDJcd_dMEwru420NjwMZ1UaX4iU1uOXYPHzNJLBv_GgN255gqOL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Below, we’ll take a look at what exactly maturity at each level means and how you can level up to the next stage based on your current data governance practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 1: Initial</strong></h3><p>Companies with level 1 data governance have little to no data management processes in place, are reactive to data management, and have no formalized tracking plan.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: In order to move beyond level 1, system architects should audit information flow and develop a plan for managing it with stakeholders and IT managers.</p><h3><strong>Level 2: Managed</strong></h3><p>Companies that achieve level 2 data governance have slightly more processes in place, some automation integrated, and more awareness of data. This is where most companies start their data governance journey.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: To upgrade your data governance maturity to level 3, focus on developing data regulation and documentation guidelines. Your system architects should begin to do this by building models of core infrastructure and documentation needs.</p><h3><strong>Level 3: Defined</strong></h3><p>Level 3 data governance means that there are some defined policies in place, you’re regularly leveraging technology for data management, you’ve developed a road map for integrating data, and best practices are more widely understood across the company.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel: </strong>As you move into level 4, continue to implement data stewardship by assigning and implementing policies and rules of data management. This policy framework will underpin regular risk assessments and help you create a central program for educating teams on data best practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 4: Quantitatively Managed</strong></h3><p>By level 4, your company should have a clear, enterprise-wide data governance structure with projects that follow your set rules and principles and models that are well documented and regularly reviewed. You should have a well-defined policy framework that outlines frequent risk assessments and methods for educating enterprise teams on the company’s data management best practices.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: Now that your framework has been created and implemented, focus on defining and setting performance measurement metrics for each process. To do this, create a plan for maintaining data models and check that each project follows your data best practices to avoid dirtying data down the line.</p><h3><strong>Level 5: Optimizing</strong></h3><p>Level 5 is the holy grail of data governance. 🏆 At this point, data governance should be streamlined, and processes should be automated. Data governance is at the core of how you do business.</p><p>This means that data governance is no longer an afterthought or detour on the way to how you do business. Instead, all teams and employees should know how to follow data best practices, and every project you do should follow these rules and principles to create and utilize clean data.</p><p>Since this is the ultimate level of data governance, there is no upleveling from here. Instead, if you reach level 5, focus on continuously measuring and analyzing ROI for all projects, so you keep your data integrity.</p><h2><strong>Make Better Decisions with Better Data</strong></h2><p>Your data governance is only as mature as the data underneath it is good. To become truly data-driven, you must ensure you have a single, high-quality source of truth to work with.</p><p>Avo helps you create this single source of truth and make the right data-driven decisions to move your business by allowing you to prioritize, inspect, analyze, and future-proof your tracking to create reliable data now …</p></div></div>

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): -£500 * -1 = <strong>£500</strong></li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inclusive writing is the usage of the language with neutrality. Inclusiveness has a positive impact on our lives, as they don’t offend interlocutors based on abilities/disabilities, age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It would be best to read</span> <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">this content guide</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that describes how to be more inclusive when writing. The impact of fostering more inclusive writing implies changes in how we write software. Besides, sooner or later, we see that it affects many aspects of everyday life communication. 🌱</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some time ago,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/4/229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a proposal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;regarding the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch name in </span><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/tag/git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Git</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> came up. I got pleased that the concern of an inclusive language arrived in the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/category/development-tools">tool I use every day for development</a>. The proposal addresses replacing the master branch name by a more inclusive one, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=49decddd39e5f6132ccd7d9fdc3d7c470b0061bb">such as <code>main</code>, <code>primary</code>, or <code>principal</code></a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At SourceLevel, we have opted for using <code>main</code>&nbsp;as the default branch name. Did you know you can change the default branch in your Git repositories? You can do it by both </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitLab</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Project Settings &gt; Repository</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">) and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitHub</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Repository Settings &gt; Branches</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the default branch of your repositories may break some tools. In the case of SourceLevel, we already support the custom default branch, and it synchronizes with GitHub and GitLab. Changing on those tools automatically replicates in our tool.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Steps for changing your default branch</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the examples below, I rename the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to <code>main</code>. You should discuss with your team and find the name that better suits you.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, we need to rename it locally:</span></p>
<pre><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git branch -m master main
</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git push origin main -u</span></pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And you’re done! These two commands rename your local <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch and then push it to the remote server. It’s a secure way to start, once the commands don’t delete the remote <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note that after changing the name to main, everyone who clones the repository gets the new default branch set. However, people who had previously cloned the repository are still pointing to the master branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To move forward with the change, everyone in your team needs to run a <a href="https://twitter.com/xunit/status/1269881005877256192">few commands</a>. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For a complete guide, I strongly recommend reading </span><a href="https://dev.to/damcosset/replacing-master-in-git-2jim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Damien Cosset’s blog post</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using SourceLevel as an Inclusive Language watchdog</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now that we have a more inclusive branch name, there may be references to other terms that we should avoid. They may appear in variables, methods, or even comments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, we need to look for them the whole codebase. This part can demand lots of hard work, depending on the size and terminology used throughout codebases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the existing code doesn’t prevent you or your team from using exclusive language again. What if a bot could notify you when a contravention appears? You can use the <a href="https://docs.sourcelevel.io/engines/grep/"><code>grep</code> linter </a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as a watchdog!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Configure your <code>.sourcelevel.yml</code> file adding rules that look for exclusive language and suggest more appropriate terms for each Pull or Merge Requests using SourceLevel’s <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/automated-code-review">automated code review</a> feature. It should look something like this:</span></p>
<pre>engines:
  grep:
    config:
      patterns:
        allowlist:
          pattern: "/white[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Whitelist'. Prefer the term 'Allowlist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
        blocklist:
          pattern: "/black[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Blacklist'. Prefer the term 'Blocklist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
    enabled: true</pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After pushing it to the main branch, SourceLevel can help you achieve a more inclusive language throughout the codebase!</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In short</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using an inclusive language is crucial for fostering a diverse culture. Git has changed the naming conventions to be more language-inclusive, and so you should change. Our development tools, like GitHub and GitLab, already supports the change.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SourceLevel deals very nicely with repositories that changed the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to a more appropriate word. Besides, you can use the <code>grep</code>&nbsp;linter the look for exclusive terms contained in the source code.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the inclusive language gap may happen in other aspects of our lives, have you already thought about them?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Raise the discussion in your team and use the tools to favor a more inclusive world 💚!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>You know what really sucks? Breaking bones. I’d been watching too many mountain biking videos on YouTube and after the first jump on a ride at my local bike trails, I came to realise that my enthusiasm and confidence far outweighed my skill. After over-jumping the jump, hitting a tree, flying over the bars and landing directly on my left shoulder 4 metres down the trail, I now have a broken clavicle (collar bone).</p>

<p>Living in the UK, we have public health care, so my brother drove me straight to Accident and Emergency. An x-ray soon confirmed that I’d snapped my collar bone in two, but apparently there’s not very much to be done. They gave me a sling, told me I’d need to take some pain killers for a few days, and booked me in at the fracture clinic for the following day. At the fracture clinic I go through the x-rays with a specialist doctor while he tells me about the next ten weeks of my life are going to be like. At this point I can barely move my arm. My shoulder’s the size of a water melon and turning yellow. Ten weeks like this. Shit.</p>

<p>I work as a software developer. Mainly ASP.NET and C# stuff. This means I live in Visual Studio… all day, everyday. Have you ever tried to work in VS one handed? Give it a try. It can be done but it’s not easy. One of the hardest things are keyboard shortcuts. Alt+Enter especially. I’ve got big hands, but even I struggle with that one using only my right hand. Luckily most functionality is available through context menus or through other parts of the UI.</p>

<p>A fantastic thing about VS is that nearly all keyboard shortcuts are remappable. I’d never thought of this as an accessibility feature before, but it really is. I’ve resisted changing anymore keyboard shortcuts than strictly necessary, as I’m intending to start using both arms again one day, but it’s fantastic that this is available in a tool that I rely on to work and pay the bills.</p>

<p>The majority of my work as a developer is web based, so when considering accessibility I tend to think about making things accessible for those with visual impairments; the blind and the partially sighted. Ensuring that the site works with screen readers and making sure controls and text have sufficient size and contrast is where a lot of accessibility effort is generally focused. There’s also things like not making tap targets not too close together, which is as much a mobile friendliness consideration as an accessibility consideration.</p>

<p>As most of my work is for the web, I don’t develop very many piece of software that utilise keyboard shortcuts extensively. If any of my future work does incorporate keyboard shortcuts, I’m certainly going to be considering how people with physical restrictions will be able to use them.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the “official” guidelines for keyboard shortcut accessibility are (or whether there are any guidelines!), but during the last few weeks of convalescence I’ve thought about the guidelines that I’d appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-guidelines-for-keyboard-shortcuts">Accessibility guidelines for keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single handed shortcuts:</strong> Prefer shortcut keys that can be reached with a single hand. Most shortcuts are comprised of a modifier key (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Win, Cmd) along with another “normal” key. Try to keep the “normal” key within reasonable reach of the modifier. Shift and Ctrl <em>usually</em> have keys on both sides of the keyboard, so more keys can be paired with these. Note that although Alt appears on both sides of the space bar, the right hand key is AltGr. They are actually two different keys, so keep that in mind when mapping shortcuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Remappable:</strong> It’s not always reasonable to make all the default keyboard shortcuts single-handed. It’s also likely that for able bodied users, some single handed shortcuts may actually be less comfortable or convenient than shortcuts that require both hands. That’s fine, and it’s a good idea to cater to your primary demographic. It’s also a good idea to allow users to remap these shortcuts. It’s not simply an accessibility feature, it’s great for the types that love to customise everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide alternatives:</strong> Providing an interface to allow users to remap their keyboard shortcuts isn’t always feasible. Maybe there’s no budget, or the scope of the project simply doesn’t allow for it. In these cases it’s simple and quick to provide alternatives to more complex or finger-stretching shortcuts. It doesn’t have to be every shortcut, but for commonly used shortcuts that are more comfortable with two hands, consider adding single-handed alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Nothing fancy or too technical. If in doubt about whether a keyboard shortcut complies with these guidelines, just try it with one hand! Imagine having to do that every time you require that shortcut… you’ll soon figure out whether it’s accessible or not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">

<p>Floating-point formats are not the most glamorous or (frankly) the important
consideration when working with deep learning models: if your model isn’t working well,
then your floating-point format certainly isn’t going to save you! However, past a
certain point of model complexity/model size/training time, your choice of
floating-point format can have a significant impact on your model training times and
even performance.</p>
<p>Here’s how the rest of this post is structured:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Why should you, a deep learning practitioner,
care</a> about what floating-point format your
model uses?</li>
<li><a href="#floating-point-formats">What even <em>is</em> floating-point</a>, especially these new
floating-point formats made specifically for deep learning?</li>
<li><a href="#advice-for-practitioners">What practical advice is there</a> on using floating-point
formats for deep learning?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Floating-Point? In <em>My</em> Deep Learning?</h2>
<p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/6052-its-more-likely-than-you-think">It’s more likely than you
think!</a></p>
<p>It’s been known for quite some time that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">deep neural networks can
tolerate</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">lower numerical
precision</a>. High-precision calculations turn out not
to be that useful in training or inferencing neural networks: the additional precision
confers no benefit while being slower and less memory-efficient.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, some models can even reach a higher accuracy with lower precision, which
recent research attributes to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00095">regularization effects from the lower
precision</a>.</p>
<p>Finally (and this is speculation on my part — I haven’t seen any experiments or papers
corroborating this), it’s possible that certain complicated models <em>cannot converge</em>
unless you use an appropriately precise format. There’s a drift between the analytical
gradient update and what the actual backward propagation looks like: the lower the
precision, the bigger the drift. I’d expect that deep learning is particularly
susceptible to an issue here because there’s a lot of multiplications, divisions and
reduction operations.</p>
<h2 id="floating-point-formats">Floating-Point Formats</h2>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at three floating-point formats for deep learning. There are a
lot more floating-point formats, but only a few have gained traction: floating-point
formats require the appropriate hardware and firmware support, which restricts the
introduction and adoption of new formats.</p>
<p>For a quick overview, Grigory Sapunov wrote a great <a href="https://medium.com/@moocaholic/fp64-fp32-fp16-bfloat16-tf32-and-other-members-of-the-zoo-a1ca7897d407">run-down of various floating-point
formats for deep
learning</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ieee-floating-point-formats">IEEE floating-point formats</h3>
<p>These floating-point formats are probably what most people think of when someone says
“floating-point”. The IEEE standard 754 sets out several formats, but for the purposes
of deep learning we are only interested three:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format">FP16</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">FP32</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">FP64</a> (a.k.a.
half-, single- and double-precision floating-point formats)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Let’s take FP32 as an example. Each FP32 number is a sequence of 32 bits,
. Altogether, this sequence represents the real number</p>

<p>Here,  (the <em>sign bit</em>) determines the sign of the represented value.</p>
<p> through  determine the magnitude or scale of the represented value
(notice that a change in any of these bits drastically changes the size of the
represented value). These bits are called the <em>exponent</em> or <em>scale bits</em>.</p>
<p>Finally,  through  determine the precise value of the represented
value. These bits are called the <em>mantissa</em> or <em>precision bits</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the more bits you have, the more you can do. Here’s how the three formats
break down:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Sign Bits</th>
<th>Exponent (Scale) Bits</th>
<th>Mantissa (Precision) Bits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FP16</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP32</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP64</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>53</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are some details that I’m leaving out here (e.g. how to represent NaNs, positive
and negative infinities), but this is largely how floating point numbers work. A lot
more detail can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers">Wikipedia
page</a>
and of course the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229">latest revision of the IEEE standard
754</a> itself.</p>
<p>FP32 and FP64 are widely supported by both software (C/C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and
hardware (x86 CPUs and most NVIDIA/AMD GPUs).</p>
<p>FP16, on the other hand, is not as widely supported in software (you need to use <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">a
special library</a> to use them in C/C++). However, since
deep learning is trending towards favoring FP16 over FP32, it has found support in the
main deep learning frameworks (e.g. <code>tf.float16</code> and <code>torch.float16</code>). In terms of
hardware, FP16 is not supported in x86 CPUs as a distinct type, but is well-supported on
modern GPUs.</p>
<h3 id="google-bfloat16">Google BFloat16</h3>
<p>BFloat16 (a.k.a. the Brain Floating-Point Format, after Google Brain) is basically the
same as FP16, but 3 mantissa bits become exponent bits (i.e. bfloat16 trades 3 bits’
worth of precision for scale).</p>

</figure>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, there are generally three “flavors” of values: weights,
activations and gradients. Google suggests storing weights and gradients in FP32, and
storing activations in bfloat16. However, in particularly gracious circumstances,
weights can be stored in bfloat16 without a significant performance degradation.</p>
<p>You can read a lot more on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bfloat16-the-secret-to-high-performance-on-cloud-tpus">Google Cloud
blog</a>,
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12322">this paper by Intel and Facebook studying the bfloat16
format</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of software support, bfloat16 is not supported in C/C++, but is supported in
TensorFlow (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>tf.bfloat16</code></a>) and
PyTorch (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>torch.bfloat16</code></a>).</p>
<p>In terms of hardware support, it is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Lake_(microarchitecture)">some modern
CPUS</a>, but the real
support comes out in GPUs and ASICs. At the time of writing, bfloat16 is supported by
the NVIDIA A100 (the first GPU to support it!), and <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/260344/future-amd-gpu-architecture-to-implement-bfloat16-hardware">will be supported in future AMD
GPUs</a>.
And of course, it is supported by Google TPU v2/v3.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-tensorfloat">NVIDIA TensorFloat</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn’t really its own floating-point format, just an overzealous
branding of the technique that NVIDIA developed to train in mixed precision on their
Tensor Core hardware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An NVIDIA TensorFloat (a.k.a. TF32) is just a 32-bit float that drops 13 precision bits
in order to execute on Tensor Cores. Thus, it has the precision of FP16 (10 bits), with
the range of FP32 (8 bits). However, if you’re not using Tensor Cores, it’s just a
32-bit float; if you’re only thinking about storage, it’s just a 32-bit float.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The number and type of bits in an NVIDIA TensorFloat. Source: <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/">NVIDIA blog</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One distinct advantage of TF32 is that they’re kind of like FP32. To quote from the
NVIDIA developer blog,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications using NVIDIA libraries enable users to harness the benefits of TF32 with no
code change required. TF32 Tensor Cores operate on FP32 inputs and produce results in
FP32. Non-matrix operations continue to use FP32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more about TF32 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/">on the NVIDIA
blog</a>, and
about its hardware support in the Ampere architecture on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/">the NVIDIA developer
blog</a>.</p>
<p>TF32 is not in the C/C++ standard at all, but is supported in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-11-features-revealed/">CUDA
11</a>.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, the NVIDIA A100 is the first GPU (and, at the time of writing, the only
device) supporting TF32.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-practitioners">Advice for Practitioners</h2>
<p>The first thing to say is that floating-point formats are <em>by no means</em> the most
important consideration for your deep learning model — not even close. Floating-point
formats will most likely only make a difference for very large or complex models, for
which fitting the model on GPU memory is a challenge, or for which training times are
excruciatingly long.</p>
<p>The second thing to say is that any practical advice has to be heavily dependent on what
hardware you have available to you.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-mixed-precision-amp-training--a-good-default">Automatic mixed precision (AMP) training — a good default</h3>
<p>Most deep learning stacks support mixed-precision training, which is a pretty good
default option to reap some of the benefits of low-precision training, while still
reasonably avoiding underflow and overflow problems.</p>
<p>TensorFlow supports <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision">mixed-precision training
natively</a>, whereas the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex">NVIDIA Apex
library</a> makes automatic mixed precision training
available in PyTorch. To get started, take a look at NVIDIA’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision">developer guide for
AMP</a>, and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html">documentation for
training in mixed
precision</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth going over the gist of mixed precision training. There are basically two main
tricks:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Loss scaling:</em> multiply the loss by some large number, and divide the gradient
updates by this same large number. This avoids the loss underflowing (i.e. clamping
to zero because of the finite precision) in FP16, while still maintaining faithful
backward propagation.</li>
<li><em>FP32 master copy of weights</em>: store the weights themselves in FP32, but cast them to
FP16 before doing the forward and backward propagation (to reap the performance
benefits). During the weight update, the FP16 gradients are cast to FP32 to update
the master copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about these techniques in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740">this paper by NVIDIA and Baidu
Research</a>, or on the accompanying <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/">blog post by
NVIDIA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-floating-point-formats--make-sure-itll-be-worth-it">Alternative floating-point formats — make sure it’ll be worth it</h3>
<p>If you’ve already trained your model in mixed precision, it might not be worth the time
or effort to port your code to take advantage of an alternative floating-point format
and bleeding edge hardware.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to go that route, make sure your use case really demands it.
Perhaps you can’t scale up your model without using bfloat16, or you really need to cut
down on training times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have a well-informed opinion on how bfloat16 stacks up against
TF32, so “do your homework” is all I can advise. However, since the NVIDIA A100s only
just (at the time of writing) dropped into the market, it’ll be interesting to see what
the machine learning community thinks of the various low precision options available.</p>

                  <div><p>

                  I set up a procedural content creation pipeline that imports <a href="http://stinaflodstrom.com/projects/osm/www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data into Unity and uses the Houdini Engine to create realistic cityscapes based on real world locations. The goal was to have an as automated process as possible for generating environments based on real cities. The buildings and the roads are generated from OSM building shapes and road splines using a procedural system for building type and prop placing. Traffic lights, Crossings and Trees also get their positions from OSM. Values and procedural parameters can be tweaked in Unity making it possible to create endless variations.

                  </p><p>The project was developed with the simulation team in one of the bigger automotive companies as a proof of concept for creating syntetic data for AI and render out annotated images. The environmant is complete with tags for segmentation.

Question: Tell me more about Bastille Networks</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley: <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille</span></a><span> is the leader in enterprise threat detection through software-defined radio. Bastille provides full visibility into the known and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/risks-of-cryptojacking-in-mobile-devices/">unknown mobile</a>, wireless, and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/secure-your-iot-devices/">Internet of Things devices</a> inside an enterprise’s corporate airspace–together known as the Internet of Radios. Through its patented software-defined radio and machine learning technology, Bastille senses, identifies, and localizes threats, providing security teams the ability to accurately quantify risk and mitigate airborne threats that could pose a danger to network infrastructure.</span></b></p><h3><b>2. Question: What’s unique and different about Bastille than other solutions/companies?</b></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley</strong>: Until Bastille, there was no way to apply network security mechanisms and countermeasures to RF-enabled IoT devices. IT security professionals couldn’t buy a security service like </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Enterprise</span></a><span> until we invented it.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Question: Can you dive into radio frequency security and why it’s essential for enterprises?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Corporate airspaces are under attack from invisible threats operating on Radio Frequencies (RF). Enterprises are often crucially reliant on wireless protocols, some that they don’t even know they’re using (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.). </span></p><p><span>These protocols are used in building controls and building access, for employee communications, IT, for employees. The exploitation of vulnerable wireless devices is growing increasingly common. Sophisticated attacks use compromised RF devices as their entry points into government and corporate networks. Foreign governments, competitors, and cybercriminals are conducting radio-based attacks on enterprises to access intellectual property and sensitive information.</span></p><h3><strong>4. Question: Can you discuss the importance of why enterprises need to implement and enforce more nuanced electronic device policies to accurately distinguish between approved and unapproved electronic devices in secure areas?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> RF-enabled devices are everywhere: According to Statistica, there are 4.7 billion Cellular phones, 8.4 billion Bluetooth devices, and 9 billion Wi-Fi devices, added to this is the increasing use of “wearables” such as FitBits and other personal devices with embedded radios, with a variety of audio/video capture, pairing and transmission capabilities.</span></p><p><span>Current policies are outdated: While some government and commercial buildings have secure areas where no cell phones or other RF-emitting devices are allowed, detecting and locating radio-enabled devices is largely based on the honor system or one time scans for devices. Bad actors do not follow the honor system and one time scans are, just that, one time and cannot monitor 24×7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>New solutions for a new age:</span><span> Bastille</span><span> enables security teams to differentiate between </span><b>approved and unapproved devices, and </b><span>accurately places </span><b>dots on a floor-plan map </b><span>for device location and sends alerts when a device is found where it should not be or doing what it should not do.</span> <span>Bastille</span><span> Networks also integrates with existing security systems such as Splunk, MDM, and camera systems.</span></p><h3><b>5. Question: What cybersecurity measures would you recommend for enterprises and why?</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley:&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Take Control of Your Airspace:<span> Obtain visibility into devices that use the big four protocols: cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BLE. Locating every radio emitter provides situational awareness into devices in an enterprise’s network.</span></b></p><ul><li><b>Evaluate RF Technology:<span> Assessing RF security solutions is vital in preserving company secrets. As security teams examine RF products in the market, considering a checklist of capabilities should include solutions that can detect, analyze, alert, and accurately locate cellular devices that incorporate airspaces in real-time.</span></b></li><li><b>Deploy RF Solutions:<span> Proactively equipping an organization with RF security technology will future-proof an enterprise from an RF breach. Adopting RF solutions that constantly monitor and detect the transmissions of devices in the wireless spectrum will combat nefarious attacks.</span></b></li></ul><h3><strong>6. Question: Can you shed more light on Bastille Express?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Earlier this year, Bastille launched </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/bastille-express" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Express</span></a><span>, the commercial version of the government spec Bastille FlyAway Kit, for forward-deployed locations.</span></p><p><span>Bastille Express</span><span> can detect and locate authorized and unauthorized Cellular, Bluetooth, BLE, and Wi-Fi devices operating within an area of 3,000 to 5,000 square feet such as conference meeting rooms, remote offices, hotel areas, or speaking locations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.bastille.net/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=640%2C163&amp;ssl=1" alt="Bastille networks logo" width="640" height="163" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1024%2C261&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=300%2C76&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1536%2C391&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=2048%2C522&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1024%2C261&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=300%2C76&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=1536%2C391&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=2048%2C522&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bastille-Logo.png?resize=640%2C163&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p>Visit the official <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bastille Networks website</a></p><p><strong>SIMILAR INTERVIEWS</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/interview-with-paul-lipman-bullguard/" rel="bookmark">Exclusive Interview With Paul Lipman, CEO Of BullGuard</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/interview-with-matt-davey-1password/" rel="bookmark">Exclusive Interview With Matt Davey, COO Of 1Password</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/how-to-secure-and-protect-a-website/" rel="bookmark">How To Secure And Protect A Website [We Asked 38 Experts]</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/interview-with-hugh-taylor-digital-downfall/" rel="bookmark">Exclusive Interview With Hugh Taylor, Author Of Digital Downfall</a></li><li><a href="https://secureblitz.com/effective-cybersecurity-strategy-for-a-small-business/" rel="bookmark">Most Effective Cybersecurity Strategy For A Small Business [We Asked 45+ Experts]</a></li></ul><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="http://www.techsegun.com/" target="_blank" title="Daniel Segun" rel="nofollow"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/daniel-segun-author-pic.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="Daniel Segun" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/daniel-segun-author-pic.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>Daniel Segun is the Founder and CEO of SecureBlitz Cybersecurity Media, with a background in Computer Science and Digital Marketing.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span> didnâ€™t really understand the word â€˜graceâ€™ until I swam with manta rays. These placid members of the shark family are the embodiment of grace; winged fish <a href="https://www.mantatrust.org/mobula-alfredi" target="_blank">14 feet</a> across who swoop and somersault with such precision that a manta scooping up plankton at speeds of up to <a href="https://www.deepseanews.com/2013/08/the-superhero-like-swimming-of-manta-rays/" target="_blank">22 miles per hour</a> can graze the hair of a SCUBA diver without touching her head. And as I experienced while diving in Hawaii, if you sit quietly on the ocean floor, theyâ€™ll do it not just once but again and again before disappearing into the blue abyss, as ephemeral as a cloud.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>For both their grace and their sheer otherworldly coolness, people love manta rays. The animals generate $50 million a year from tourists like me who want to swim or dive with them. But given how popular they are, much about mantas remains a mystery. They're truly wild creatures, too big for most aquariums and too far-ranging to easily study. Their life history and migration patterns are little known.&nbsp;No one has ever seen a manta give birth in the wild; we have no idea where they do so.&nbsp;And&nbsp;until&nbsp;recently, scientists thought there was only one kind of&nbsp;manta. It wasnâ€™t until 2009 that&nbsp;the more transient oceanic mantas (<em>Mobula birostris</em>) were recognized as a distinct species from the slightly smaller reef mantas (<em>Mobula alfredi</em>).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>â€œThere are these big, intelligent creatures roaming around and we just donâ€™t know much about them,â€� says&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Andrzejaczek, a shark scientist with the&nbsp;Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237067445_Trends_in_sightings_and_environmental_influences_on_a_coastal_aggregation_of_manta_rays_and_whale_sharks" target="_blank">overfishing</a> has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770565/" target="_blank">reduced</a> some manta populations by <a href="https://saveourseas.com/project-leader/lauren-peel/" target="_blank">80 percent</a>, and the IUCN Red List classifies both species as <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/195459/68632178" target="_blank">Vulnerable</a> and declining. Scientists are now trying to gather the basic information that could help the animals survive. In the process,&nbsp;they're learning that&nbsp;manta rays&nbsp;are more complex and fascinating than anyone imagined—bestowing their grace not just on humans lucky enough to swim with them, but on entire ecosystems.</p>
<blockquote>The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace.</blockquote>
<p>One way mantas shape marine environments is by traveling regularly between the deep ocean and coral reefs. Lauren Peel, a biologist with the Manta Trust and Save Our Seas Foundation, explains that in doing so, mantas move nutrients through the ocean. They eat a certain type of zooplankton that only lives offshore, for example, then return to coral reefs and defecate, depositing a suite of nutrients not otherwise available in the shallow seas.&nbsp;â€œTheyâ€™re essentially fertilizing coral reefs,â€� says Peel, who published a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.190599" target="_blank">2019 study</a> on the discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peel and her colleagues believe this fertilization may <a href="https://saveourseas.com/reef-manta-rays-may-promote-the-growth-of-coral-reefs-in-seychelles/" target="_blank">boost reef growth</a>, which not only leads to a greater biodiversity of corals and sponges but also supports the invertebrates, fish, mammals and reptiles that call reefs home. By analyzing tissue samples from 50 reef mantas and 20 different types of fish in the Seychelles, Peel also found that mantas are the only animals performing this essential fertilization. â€œOn top of being able to move such large distances and access different zooplankton sources, theyâ€™re consistently feeding, so theyâ€™re able to supply a larger amount of nutrients over a larger period of time over a larger spatial scale," Peel says.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Still, the realization that protecting mantas benefits entire coral communities isnâ€™t enough to save the species. Unlike some other imperiled fish, mantas are not targeted by an organized fishery that will grudgingly adhere to conservation measures like bag limits. Instead, mantas are killed by small local fisheries, poachers who sell their gills for traditional Chinese medicine, and commercial fishermen who accidentally take mantas as bycatch. That means the best way to protect them might be through refuges where no fishing is allowed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, keeping poachers out of vast, open marine protected areas (MPAs) is its own challenge. Thatâ€™s one reason why Andrzejaczek analyzed the movement of reef mantas in the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. By showing where mantas hang out, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v639/p137-153/" target="_blank">her data</a> are helping patrol boats better target their policing.</p>
<p>To create adequate marine refuges, scientists must also to figure out how far mantas roam. A <a href="https://mbr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41200-019-0173-6" target="_blank">2019 study</a> showed that one reef manta swam a whopping 714 miles—hundreds of miles farther than the previous known record. Andrzejaczek, on the other hand, found that all 33 tagged mantas in her study stayed within the <a href="http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/7707499/%252523:~:text=On%252525201st%25252520April%252525202010,%25252520the,unrivalled%25252520in%25252520scale%25252520and%25252520significance." target="_blank">200-mile span</a> of the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. Perhaps, she theorizes, some reef mantas migrate long distances while others stay local to a particular reef.</p>
<p>Manta raysâ€™ charisma could play a role in saving them, too. After a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065051" target="_blank">2013 study</a> showed that a live manta can bring $1 million in tourism revenue in over its lifetime, compared to $500 dead, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/21/indonesia-hopes-cash-manta-ray-tourism.html" target="_blank">Indonesia joined</a> Australia, Ecuador, the European Union, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Yap, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Hawaii and Florida in banning manta ray fishing. The Manta Trust is also creating guidelines for sustainable manta ray tourism,&nbsp;like instructing divers to stay calm and let mantas guide the encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>â€œItâ€™s understandable that people get excited,â€� says Annie Murray, a marine biologist with the Manta Trust. â€œBut unfortunately that can lead to people swimming really fast, chasing the manta to try to get the best selfie, and thatâ€™s going to disturb them, especially when theyâ€™re feeding.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_aa7e40c628a36f3002fd99c31b2755ad.jpg" alt="Manta from below"><figcaption><span><strong>Manta from below </strong>No two mantas have the same pattern of underbelly spots, making these invaluable for identifying individuals. </span><br><span>Guy Stevens | Manta Trust</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Murray herself has swam with dozens of mantas, each with distinct personalities. Without prompting, she, Peel and Andrzejaczek each described the animalsâ€™ curiosity and intellect with an awe thatâ€™s rare among scientists.&nbsp;â€œWhen you swim with mantas, itâ€™s an interaction between the two of you,â€� says Murray. â€œThatâ€™s what got me in the beginning. But from a more scientific point of view, Iâ€™m fascinated not only by how they interact with humans, but with each other.â€�<br></p>
<p>Manta rays have the largest brain-to-body ratios of any fish; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z" target="_blank">evidence suggests</a> they might also recognize themselves in mirrors, widely considered a hallmark of human-like self-awareness. She and others are studying how manta raysâ€™ clear intelligence manifests through social behaviors, and whether animals long considered solitary oceanic wanderers actually operate within social networks or hierarchies. While the social research is too new to draw conclusions from, itâ€™s within the realm of possibility that mantas form lifelong social bonds.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more we learn about mantas, the more it calls to mind another definition of grace—â€œthe&nbsp;free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.â€� The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace, a salve that can make even the most cynical scientist weep into her dive mask over the wonder that remains in this wild world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1&nbsp;The mantas I swam with in&nbsp;Hawaii were reef mantas, which have a wingspan of up to 14 feet. Oceanic, or giant, mantas can be nearly 23 feet across.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the last few years I’ve been developing predominantly on Apple
MacBooks. Recently I built myself a
<a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/bestelkosten/2370528">new</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922">PC</a> with a fast
processor and lots of memory. I wanted to move some of my development tasks to
that machine. I still like the freedom that laptops give me to work from
wherever I want. Be it from the couch in my own home or from a random coffee
place in the city where I live, I just like to change environment every few
hours and not sit behind my desk all day long. I hadn’t used Windows as my
primary OS for almost 10 years. But since Windows 10 (still) comes with RDP,
which is better than VNC in terms of performance, and with WSL2, which offers a
“real” and well integrated linux experience, I was curious if I could create a
setup for remotely working on the new machine. It also would give me an
environment to debug Windows specific problems on, which should come in handy
for my side projects like <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/">clj-kondo</a>. If it didn’t work out, I
could always go dual boot with Ubuntu as the primary dev OS and use VNC if I
needed to do anything graphical. For what it is worth, here is a report of
setup process I went through.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pristine smell and beauty of a new PC contrasted with the chaotic reality of my home. <a href="https://t.co/3zLIzYg4XB">pic.twitter.com/3zLIzYg4XB</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Because I had no other Windows machines in my home, I tried creating a USB
Windows installation drive in macOS based on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-make-a-windows-10-usb-using-your-mac-build-a-bootable-iso-from-your-macs-terminal/">this</a>
blog post. No matter what I tried, at the end of the installation process
Windows <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016">would complain</a> with</p>

<blockquote><p>Windows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the
installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation.</p></blockquote>

Whereas Windows be like <a href="https://t.co/FQNzeJ6V2X">pic.twitter.com/FQNzeJ6V2X</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>A good friend offered help and created an installation drive using
<a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> on his Windows Home installation, which did work.</p>

<p>Once Windows was installed, I <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access">enabled RDP</a> and installed
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL2</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71">Ubuntu 20.04</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Windows Terminal</a>
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/">Docker Desktop for WSL2</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to run WSL2, I had to enable a virtualization option in my BIOS
first.</p>

<p>I intend to use Ubuntu WSL2 as my primary dev environment on this machine, so it
made sense to tweak the <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1456511/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-default-shell-in-windows-terminal">Terminal configuration</a>
to open Ubuntu by default, instead of PowerShell. I found it annoying that
Ubuntu in Terminal starts in the Windows home directory (<code>/mnt/c/Users/borkdude</code>), so I set <code>"startingDirectory":
"//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/borkdude"</code> in my Ubuntu profile.</p>

<p>I use zsh as my default shell on macOS and wanted that in WSL2 as well so I
installed that using <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install zsh</code> followed by <code>chsh -s $(which
zsh)</code>. I also installed <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> and enabled the
only two plugins I use on a daily basis: <code>git</code> and <code>jump</code>.</p>

<p>Then I started porting the dev setup I use for work on my MacBook, mainly
consisting of Docker images, a couple of Clojure projects, knitted together with
some bash scripts. I use a couple of shell scripts to set all my development
environment variables and aliases for easily setting up ssh tunnels. These
worked after only making a few tweaks (for example, the ethernet card is called
differently in macOS and Ubuntu in WSL2). Of course I needed to install <code>git</code> to
clone my work projects. To run Clojure projects I installed OpenJDK version 8
and 11 via <code>apt</code>. I use <a href="https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/jenv.be">jenv</a> to manage Java versions on a project
basis, which worked perfectly:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
</span><span>jenv add /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Also I installed <a href="https://boot-clj.com/">boot</a>, a Clojure build tool and the
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">Clojure CLI</a> which are all well
supported in linux.</p>

<p>Before running my work projects, I wanted to copy over a PostgreSQL database and
other data from my MacBook using <code>rsync</code>. Before I could do that, I needed to
enable <code>ssh</code> in Ubuntu. I found out I could do this by running <code>sudo service ssh
start</code> but I still could not log in from my MacBook. It turns out you also have
to forward and open up the port in the Windows Firewall. I found
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723">this</a>
PowerShell script that lets you do that. As the comment suggests, I also created
a scheduled task that runs this script upon Windows login. I did the same thing
for running the <code>ssh</code> service using <code>wsl -u root sudo service ssh start</code>. Be
sure to select <code>Run using the highest privileges</code>. I’m sure there is a better
way to do this via <code>systemd</code> in WSL2, but this works for me. So now I could
<code>rsync</code> my the data from macOS to WSL2. I started the Docker containers, the
Clojure projects and it worked! We have a fairly I/O intensive process as part
of our stack, which seems to perform well in WSL2.</p>

<p>Enabling SSH in WSL also lets me use Emacs from my laptop and edit files on the
remote machine using <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">tramp mode</a>. I
ran into one issue with this. Since I use a non-standard prompt in zsh, emacs
tramp could not parse the output from the remote shell. So I added this hack to
my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
<span>4</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>case</span> <span>"$TERM"</span> in
</span><span>    <span>"dumb"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>        bash
</span><span><span>esac</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Emacs sets <code>TERM</code> to <code>"dumb"</code> when opening files using <code>tramp</code>. When this is the
case, I just invoke <code>bash</code> instead of continuing with <code>zsh</code>. There may be a
better solution, but this works.</p>

<p>Of course I also wanted to be able to run Emacs on the machine itself. I first
tried to run Emacs in Windows <a href="https://github.com/m-parashar/emax64">natively</a>,
but I read somewhere that editing WSL2 files directly from Windows is not
recommended. Also you might run into the line ending differences between Windows
and linux/macOS. I decided to play it safe and install emacs inside WSL2 using
<code>apt</code>. If you do decide to use the Windows-native Emacs and have trouble finding
where emacs expects configuration files, you can find this using <code>M-x
describe-variable user-init-file</code>. On my machine that was
<code>C:\Users\borkdude\AppData\Roaming\.config\emacs\init.el.</code>. To get a graphical
UI for the emacs started from WSL2, I needed to install an X-server on
Windows. There are plenty of free and open source solutions to choose from, but
I chose to buy
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/x410/9nlp712zmn9q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">X410</a>
on sale for $9.99 instead of $49.99. It seems to be actively worked on and has
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/using-x410-with-wsl2/">good documentation</a>. To
automatically start X410 on Windows startup I followed
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/automatically-start-x410-on-login/">these</a>
instructions. When started, in the tray there is an X icon where you can modify
settings for X410. I have enabled Windowed Apps, Allow Public Access, DPI
Scaling (High Quality) and Shared Clipboard. To export the right <code>DISPLAY</code> value
for GUI applications in WSL2 I have this in my <code>.zshenv</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat /etc/resolv.conf <span>|</span> grep nameserver <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $2; exit;}'</span><span>)</span>:0.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>and then run emacs using <code>setsid emacs</code> from a zsh session (I created an alias
for this in my <code>.zshenv</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using the exact same emacs config I use on macOS, which is based on
<a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">@bbatsov</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">prelude</a>. It looks and feels the same as on
macOS, although now I probably have to learn the “real” emacs keybindings for
copying (<code>M-w</code>) and pasting (<code>C-y</code>) instead of using the macOS keybindings,
which may be in fact a nice side effect of this experiment.</p>

<p>Even connecting to an nREPL server with <code>cider-connect</code> works seemlessly from my
laptop, provided that I forward and open up the port in Windows Firewall like
described above.</p>

<p>Some closing tips.</p>

<p>There is a known <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">issue</a> with
memory usage of WSL2. Since linux uses non-allocated memory for filesystem
caching, Windows thinks this memory is really used. As time goes by, Windows
could end up allocating all your system’s memory to WSL2. To put a limit to
this, I use this config in <code>C:\Users\borkdude\.wslconfig</code>:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
<span>3</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>[</span>wsl2<span>]</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>memory</span><span>=</span>92GB
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>My PC has a whopping 128GB of memory so this still leaves 36GB of memory to
Windows.</p>

<p>As I will mainly use this PC for work, I turn it off at night and during the
weekends. To get back where I left, without restarting all my development
processes from scratch, I use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/920730/how-to-disable-and-re-enable-hibernation-on-a-computer-that-is-running">Hibernate</a>
setting.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to set up a VPN between my laptop and
Windows machine so I can connect through RDP, emacs tramp and/or nREPL when I go
outside of my home.</p>

<p>For RDP I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12">Microsoft Remote Desktop.app</a>. Since I have a Retina screen, I enabled the “optimize for Retina displays” setting which gives a better resolution.</p>

<p>As a bonus I can re-use some licenses I already owned for apps I am using on
macOS: Beyond Compare and Acronis True Image.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised with WSL2, the Terminal app and Docker
integration. I’ve only been using this setup for week but so far so good.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Flu (influenza) and pneumonia vaccinations are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to new research reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC®) 2020.</p>

<p>Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. </li>
<li>More frequent flu vaccination was associated
with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence.</li>
<li>Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes.</li>
<li>Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold).</li>
</ul>

<p>"With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer.</p>

<p>"It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age."</p>

<h2>Seasonal Flu Vaccine May Reduce Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia</h2>

<p>Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066).</p>

<p>Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p&lt;0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years.</p>

<p>The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's."</p>

<h2>Pneumonia Vaccine May Reduce Alzheimer's Risk later in life.</h2><p>
 Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene.</p>

<p>The researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone.</p>

<p>"Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes."</p>

<h2>Infection Substantially Increases Mortality in People with Dementia</h2>

<p>People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia.</p>

<p>Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit.</p>

<p>"Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.</p>

            <p>You can try it out for yourself using this link <a href="https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com/">https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com</a> - just hold a Sudoku puzzle up to your WebCam. Or try it on your mobile phone - it should work pretty well in a mobile browser.</p>

<p>A long time ago I wrote an app for the iPhone that let you take a grab a sudoku puzzle using your iPhone’s camera.</p>

<p>Recently, when I was investigating my <a href="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/2020/06/05/self-organising-ws2811-leds.html">self organising Christmas lights project</a> I realised that the browser APIs and ecosystem had advanced to the point that it was probably possible to recreate the system running purely in the browser.</p>

<p>As you can see it works pretty well:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOC-ad0BsY0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As always, all the code is on GitHub for you to try out for yourself: <a href="https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku">https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku</a></p>

<p>It’s good to start with a simple definition of the problem we are trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given an image identify and extract the Sudoku puzzle, recognise the numbers in each cell, solve the puzzle, render the results on top of the original image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/1-puzzle.jpg" alt="Puzzle Image"></p>

<p>As a classically trained image processing guy, my first port of call is to remove redundant information.</p>

<p>We don’t care about colours, so we’ll convert the image to greyscale. As you can see we’ve not lost any useful information.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/2-greyscale.jpg" alt="Greyscale Image"></p>

<p>Looking at the image, we only ready care about paper and ink, so it makes sense to binarise the image and make black or white.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/3-thresholded.png" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Next, we need to identify the blob that is the puzzle. Once we’ve got that we can extract the image of the puzzle and extract the contents of each box of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/4-located.jpg" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Apply some OCR to the contents of each box, solve the puzzle and our job is done.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/6-solved.png" alt="Solved Puzzle"></p>

<p>It’s a pretty straightforward image processing pipeline!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/7-pipeline.jpg" alt="Pipeline"></p>

<p>Let’s dive into each of these steps in turn and see how they work.</p>



<p>We’re taking a feed from the camera on the device. This comes into us as an RGB image. We’re not really interested in colour as we’re working with printed puzzles which will typically by printed in black and white.</p>

<p>So our first step is to convert from RGB to greyscale.</p>

<p>If we look at the standard formula for this we get this fomula <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s interesting about this is that a large portion of the value is coming from the green channel. So we can apply a little shortcut to our RGB to greyscale conversion and just take the green channel of the image.</p>



<p>We’re going to use morphological operations for locating the puzzle - typically these work on black and white binary images, so our next step is binarise our image.</p>

<p>This involves applying a threshold to seperate out foreground from background pixels.</p>

<p>Trying to apply a global threshold to the image can result in very poor results - especially when lighting conditions are not good.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/8-global-threshold.jpg" alt="Global Threshold"></p>

<p>However, if we look at a small section of the image we can see from the histogram that we do have an obvious collection of ink pixels and paper pixels.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/9-local-threshold-hist.jpg" alt="Local Area Histogram"></p>

<p>What we want to do is examine each pixel in the context of its surrounding area.</p>

<p>A simple way to do this is to apply a blur to the image and then compare the original image with this blurred image.</p>

<p>Doing this gives us a very clean segmented image even when lighting conditions are not ideal</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/A-local-thresholded.jpg" alt="Local Threshold"></p>



<p>We’ve now got a fairly clean image that contains our puzzle along with a bunch of random other printed elements. Typically you’d jump straight in here with something like a hough transform to detect lines. However we can be a bit smarter about what we are doing and take a bit of a shortcut.</p>

<p>We know that whoever is taking the picture should be pointing the camera at a puzzle. So we can assume that the puzzle would be the largest object in the image and also have the most number of pixels. We can also apply other heuristics such as aspect ratio to filter out elements that probably aren’t a puzlle.</p>

<p>If we scan the image pulling out all connected components the connected component that contains the puzzle should be the one with the most points.</p>

<p>Doing this lets us isolate the puzzle grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/B-located.png" alt="Located Puzzle"></p>



<p>With the puzzle grid identified we now need to identify the four corners of the puzzle. Once again we can apply a fairly simple heuristic to this problem. The pixels that are in the four corners should have the smallest manhatten distance from the corners of the max extents of the extracted component.</p>

<p>Runing this algorithm for all four extents of our located puzzle gives us the four corners.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/D-corners.png" alt="Puzzle Corners"></p>



<p>We know where the puzzle is in our image. We have the location of the four corner points.</p>

<p>To extract the puzzle image we formulate our problem into one of a homographic transform.</p>

<p>We want to map from the camera image of the puzzle to an ideal image of the puzzle that is not distorted by perpective or rotations.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography.png" alt="Mapping from flat image to camera image"></p>

<p>We do this by computing a homography between the two planes. The formula shown can be transformed into this - as you can see we need four points - this maps nicely onto the corner points that we’ve already located.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography2.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>If we rewrite the matrices algebraically we can find h using this algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography3.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>You can find more details on how to do this here - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/">https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/</a></p>

<p>Now that we have the homography between our ideal image and the camera image we can map pixels between images.</p>

<p>This gives us a nice square puzzle image from the camera image.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/F-extracted.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>Once we’ve got the square puzzle image we need to extract the contents of each individual cell. We can use the thresholded version of the image for this.</p>

<p>Looking at each box in turn we extract the bounds of any connected region starting from the center of each cell. We can then use this bounds to extract an image from the square greyscale image.</p>

<p>If there is no connected region in the center of the cell then we know that it is empty.</p>

<p>We now have an image for each populated cell of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/G-boxes.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>We’re going to use a neural network to perform OCR on each image. I’m going to use TensorFlow to train the network and then TensorFlow js to run the network in the browser.</p>

<p>Our neural network is going to be trained to recognise the digits 1 through 9.</p>

<p>I’ve synthesized a large number of training examples from a wide selection of fonts rendering a greyscale image of each digit.</p>

<p>I’ve added a small amount of blur and some Gaussian noise to each image. Hopefully this will provide a reasonable representation of what we will be getting in a live environment.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training"></p>

<p>I’ve also sparated out 10% of the images into a testing data set that we can use to evaluate how well our network performs.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>I’m using an interactive Jupyter notebook to train the network - this is available in the GitHub repository. You’ll also find more information on the training in the YouTube video.</p>

<p>I perform some image normalisation and resize the input images to 20 by 20 pixels - we need to remember to also do this in the javascript code so that it matches.</p>

<p>I’m also augmenting our training data to help the network generalise. This will add some random mutations to our input data set.</p>

<p>Running the training we can see that we have pretty good accuracy on both training and validation.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the confusion matrix we can see that “1”s and “7”s are currently getting confused.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training3.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the failed images I’m pretty happy with the performance. I think the fonts that it is failing on would not be used in the real world so I’m happy to ignore these failures.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training5.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>As I’m happy with the neural network structure I’m going to train it on all the data and use the resulting network in my production code.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training6.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>



<p>We can solve a sudoku puzzle using Donald Knuth’s application of Dancing Links to his Algorithm X for solving the exact cover problem.</p>

<p>Dancing links uses the seemingly very simple realisation that we can remove and put back nodes from a doubly linked list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX1.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>We can see that when we remove node B from the list it still has pointers back to the nodes that used to link to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX2.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>This means that node B contains all the information required to add it back into the list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX3.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>I go into more detail in the video around Algorithm X and you can find a good description in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">WikiPedia artical</a>.</p>

<p>Dancing links solves the problem of backtracking in an efficient way.</p>

<p>We can encode the sparse matrix used by Algorithm X as a doubly linked circular list going left and right for the rows and up and down for the columns.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX4.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>Since these are now linked lists we can use fact that we can efficiently remove and re-add elements to perform the column and row removals and to backtrack if needed.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this algorithm by recoding our sudoku puzzle as an exact coverage problem. Translating a puzzle into a set of constraints gives us a sparse matrix of 729 rows by 324 columns.</p>

<p>Here’s what a sudoku puzzle looks like when turned into a set of constraints.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX5.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>



<p>To render our results we could draw our text into a square image and then project each pixel onto the image coming from the camera. This would be quite computationally intensive.</p>

<p>Alternatively for each puzzle cell we could take an imaginary line through the center of each cell. We can then project that using our homographic transform and use this project line to calculate an approximate height and angle for the cell.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering.png" alt="Approximate Digit Angle And Size"></p>

<p>We then simply draw the text at the projected location of the cell with the calculated height and angle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering2.jpg" alt="Rendered Solution"></p>

refer instead to <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1270061316368224256">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> (Go team
security lead):</p>

<blockquote><p>PSA: don't rely on GnuTLS, please.</p>

<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> Whoops, for the past 10 releases most TLS 1.0–1.2
connection could be passively decrypted and most TLS 1.3 connections
intercepted. Trivially.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/">TLS 1.2–1.0 session tickets are awful</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are reading this correctly: supposedly encrypted TLS connections
made with affected GnuTLS releases are vulnerable to <em>passive</em>
cleartext recovery attack (and active for 1.3, but who uses that
anyways). That is extremely bad. It's pretty close to just switching
everyone to HTTP instead of HTTPS, more or less. I would have a lot
more to say about the security of GnuTLS in particular -- and security
in general -- but I am mostly concerned about patching holes in the
roof right now, so this article is not about that.</p>

<p>This article is about figuring out what, exactly, was exposed in our
infrastructure because of this.</p>






<p>Assuming you're running Debian, this will show a list of packages that
<code>Depends</code> on GnuTLS:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you run this only on hosts running Buster or
above. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to pick machines
running GnuTLS 3.6.4 or later.</p>

<p>Note that this list only <em>first level</em> dependencies! It is perfectly
possible that another package uses GnuTLS without being listed
here. For example, in the above list I have <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code>, so the
be really thorough, I would actually need to recurse down the
dependency tree.</p>

<p>On my desktop, this shows an "interesting" list of targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
<li><code>cadaver</code> - AKA WebDAV</li>
<li><code>curl</code> &amp; <code>wget</code></li>
<li><code>fwupd</code> - another attack on top of <a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md">this one</a></li>
<li><code>git</code> (through the <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code> dependency)</li>
<li><code>mutt</code> - all your emails</li>
<li><code>weechat</code> - your precious private chats</li>
</ul>


<p>Arguably, fetchers like <code>apt</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>fwupd</code>, and <code>wget</code> rely on HTTPS for
"authentication" more than secrecy, although <code>apt</code> has its own
OpenPGP-based authentication so that wouldn't matter anyways. Still,
this is truly distressing. And I haven't mentioned here things like
<code>gobby</code>, <code>network-manager</code>, <code>systemd</code>, and others - the scope of this is
broad. Hell, even good old <code>lynx</code> links against GnuTLS.</p>

<p>In our infrastructure, the magic command looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cumin -o txt -p 0  'F:lsbdistcodename=buster' "apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u" | tee gnutls-rdepds-per-host | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>There, the result is even more worrisome, as those important packages seem to rely on GnuTLS for their transport security:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mariadb</code> - all MySQL traffic and passwords</li>
<li><code>mandos</code> - full disk encryption</li>
<li><code>slapd</code> - LDAP passwords</li>
</ul>


<p><code>mandos</code> is especially distressing although it's probably not
vulnerable because it seems it doesn't store the cleartext -- it's
encrypted with the client's OpenPGP public key -- so the TLS tunnel
never sees the cleartext either.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/1270078914996682753">Other reports</a> have also mentioned the following servers link
against GnuTLS and could be vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exim</code></li>
<li><code>rsyslog</code></li>
<li><code>samba</code></li>
<li>various <code>VNC</code> implementations</li>
</ul>




<p>Those programs are not affected by this vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apache2</code></li>
<li><code>gnupg</code></li>
<li><code>python</code></li>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>openssh</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This list is not exhaustive, naturally, but serves as an example of
common software you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>The vulnerability only exists in GnuTLS, as far as we know, so
programs linking against other libraries are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Because the vulnerability affects session tickets -- and those are set
on the server side of the TLS connection -- only users of GnuTLS as a
server are vulnerable. This means, for example, that while <code>weechat</code>
uses GnuTLS, it will only suffer from the problem when acting as a
server (which it does, in relay mode) or, of course, if the remote IRC
server also uses GnuTLS. Same with apt, curl, wget, or git: it is
unlikely to be a problem because it is only used as a client; the
remote server is usually a webserver -- not git itself -- when using
TLS.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it's not because a package links against GnuTLS that
it <em>uses</em> it. For example, I have been told that, on Arch Linux, if
both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are available, the <code>mutt</code> package will use the
latter, so it's not affected. I haven't confirmed that myself nor have I
checked on Debian.</p>

<p>Also, because it relies on session tickets, there's a time window
after which the ticket gets cycled and properly initialized. But that
is <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1270054740559384576">apparently 6 hours by default</a> so it is going to protect only
really long-lasting TLS sessions, which are uncommon, I would argue.</p>

<p>My audit is limited. For example, it might have been better to walk
the shared library dependencies directly, instead of relying on Debian
package dependencies.</p>



<p>It seems the vulnerability might have been introduced in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/695">this merge
request</a>, itself following a (entirely reasonable) <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/184">feature request
to make it easier to rotate session tickets</a>. The merge request was
open for a few months and was thoroughly reviewed by a peer before
being merged. Interestingly, the vulnerable function
(<code>_gnutls_initialize_session_ticket_key_rotation</code>), explicitly says:</p>

<pre><code> * This function will not enable session ticket keys on the server side. That is done
 * with the gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() function. This function just initializes
 * the internal state to support periodical rotation of the session ticket encryption key.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it thinks it is not responsible for session ticket
initialization, yet it is. Indeed, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275/">merge request fixing the
problem</a> unconditionally does this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(session-&gt;key.initial_stek, key-&gt;data, key-&gt;size);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't reviewed the code and the vulnerability in detail, so take
the above with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275.patch">full patch is available here</a>. See also the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011">upstream issue
1011</a>, the <a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">upstream advisory</a>, the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777">Debian security
tracker</a>,
and the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843723">Redhat Bugzilla</a>.</p>



<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the affected packages and
how they are used. It can range from "meh, someone knows I downloaded
that Debian package yesterday" to "holy crap my full disk encryption
passwords are compromised, I need to re-encrypt all my drives",
including "I need to change all LDAP and MySQL passwords".</p>

<p>It promises to be a fun week for some people at least.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, one has to wonder whether we should follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a>'s advice and stop using GnuTLS altogether. There are
at least a few programs that link against GnuTLS because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing">OpenSSL licensing oddities</a> but that has been first announced in
2015, then <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/">definitely and clearly resolved in 2017</a> -- or <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/top-foss-legal-developments">maybe
that was in 2018</a>? Anyways it's fixed, pinky-promise-I-swear,
except if you're one of those weirdos still using GPL-2, of
course. Even though OpenSSL isn't the simplest and secure TLS
implementation out there, it could preferable to GnuTLS and maybe we
should consider changing Debian packages to use it in the future.</p>

<p>But then again, the last time something like this happened, it was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> and GnuTLS wasn't affected, so who knows... It is
likely that people don't have OpenSSL in mind when they suggest moving
away from GnuTLS and instead think of other TLS libraries like
<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedtls</a> (previously known as PolarSSL), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a>, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a>,
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and so on. Not that those are totally sinless either...</p>

<p>"This is fine", as they say...</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>It works well with very satisfying returnings. But the time complexity was pretty bad. In the <code>while</code> loop, it checks if the element to be inserted exists in the new array for each of the loop round. This results in <strong><em>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</em></strong>.</p><p>If an array isn't that big, then my function was just fine. But the truth is, my project needs to generate a list with more than <strong>1000</strong> elements. So it's better to optimize the algorithm. (I think it's always better to do such optimization.

        <p>2020-07-26</p>

        <p>We’ve been doing a lot of mob programming at work the last year or so and I’ve seen that I have a different attitude to naming things than others on my team. When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</p>

<p>I also saw something related recently when doing a programming course internally at work. I sat and helped a guy with an issue he was having. I saw a really bad variable name and recommended he change it. He said “later, I just need to fix this first”. I pushed the point once more saying “trust me” and then left him to his devices. A few minutes later he asked for help again, being totally stuck. Renaming the variable got him immediately unstuck. He had wasted lots of time because the name put him in a mental trap.</p>

<p>My philosophy is: <em>there are only two acceptable types of names: good names and metasyntactic names</em>. If you have a name that is bad or just a bit misleading it’s better to rename it to <code>foo</code> NOW.</p>

<p>I believe good (or metasyntactic) names lead to easier problem solving and less effort in programming. It’s not just something we add at the end to make the code more understandable to others or future you. To me the primary thing we work with in programming isn’t numbers or computation, but language.</p>

  <p><span>This essay was co-authored by <a href="https://kortina.nyc/">Andrew Kortina</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel">Namrata Patel</a>.</span></p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/04-kinky-labor-supply.png"><figcaption>Kinky (S<sub>1</sub>) vs classical (S<sub>0</sub>) labor supply curve.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment. In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.</p>

<p>At the macro level, this results in sub-optimal production, as firms are unable to satisfy their demand for labor via the usual mechanism of increasing wages. If you believe that economic productivity and growth are good, this presents a challenge when attempting to design stimulus policy, because subsidies or increases to the minimum wage would yield the same non-result as firms increasing wages. We discuss the potential efficacy of the somewhat radical idea of a tax on human attention or time spent consuming entertainment media as a way to stimulate productivity.</p>

<h3 id="declining-labor-participation-in-younger-demographics">Declining Labor Participation in Younger Demographics</h3>

<p>The overall labor force participation rate in the United States has been declining for the past several decades. The most obvious potential explanation would be an aging population (retirees comprising an increasing percentage of the overall population), but you can see this is not the root cause when you break out the labor force participation rate by age and sex:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/00-labor-participation.png"><figcaption>Labor Participation Rate via <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Labor participation has been dropping much faster for young men than any other groups. <em>(Interestingly, labor participation has been increasing most rapidly for older demographics, presumably because they must continue working later in life in order to support basic needs and healthcare costs).</em></p>

<p>In <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maguiar/files/leisure-luxuries-labor-june-2017.pdf">Leisure Luxuries and the Labor Supply of Young Men</a>, Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite stagnant wages, declining employment rates, and an increased propensity to live with their parents, younger men report increased happiness during the 2000s. This contrasts sharply with older men, whose satisfaction fell along with their relative earnings. We see the life satisfaction results as indirect evidence that younger men experienced relatively little decline in the consumption and greatly valued their improved leisure options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of young men’s time which in past decades was spent working is now spent playing video games, according to Aguiar and Hurst. Given that reported happiness moved in the opposite direction from wages and employment rate, it would seem there is some preference for this specific type of leisure over the purchasing power sacrificed in the form of foregone wages. But given that leisure activities have always been an alternative to work, we should ask what about video games specifically makes them more compelling than historical leisure activities.</p>



<h3 id="decreasing-cost-increasing-availability-and-increasing-quality-of-media-entertainment">Decreasing Cost, Increasing Availability, and Increasing Quality of Media Entertainment</h3>

<p>Video games are just one example of media entertainment content that has become more a more attractive leisure choice as a result of advances in internet and mobile device technology.</p>

<p>For most of history, media consumption was bounded, like other forms of consumption, by cost – if you wanted more books, movies, music, console video games, etc, you needed money to buy them. Notable exceptions to this pattern were radio and cable television, where you could access programming at all hours of the day for a low fixed cost (or in some cases for free) – but in these cases, limits on the syndication of premium content entailed that not every hour of watching was equally enjoyable, and there were generally still diminishing (enjoyment) returns on each additional hour spent watching.</p>

<p>The digitization of content enabled infinite storage of evergreen content in the cloud and effectively zero marginal distribution cost of content through copying. Enabling on-demand access to all of the content that has ever been produced entailed a huge increase in the supply of good content. This essentially made all of history a viable competitor to people producing new content. Similarly, social media–produced for free, by amateurs–provided another huge influx of new content and more competition for attention.</p>

<p>This increased supply and competition put pressure on professionals creating new content to make it better and cheaper. On top of that, taking a page from the cable TV playbook, internet media distributors gave away content for free, and used advertising subsidies to pay for the small amount of content that was still being professionally produced.</p>

<p>All of these changes benefited the consumer by making more and better content available for free. Today, you can pretty much always spend yet another hour consuming some new and interesting content freely available on the internet, so once you have paid the (quite cheap) cost of access to your ISP or mobile data provider, you no longer require additional wages to pay for additional consumption of media as a leisure activity.</p>

<h3 id="decreasing-signalling-utility-of-conspicuous-consumption-goods">Decreasing Signalling Utility of Conspicuous Consumption Goods</h3>

<p>Before we accept that young men are simply foregoing working in favor of spending more time playing video games or consuming other forms of media entertainment content, we should ask what else they might spend foregone earnings on and why they are not working to fund that spend.</p>

<p>In general there are three types of goods: goods that meet your basic needs, leisure goods (including media goods), and conspicuous consumption goods (those that signal genetic fitness, social status, belonging, etc.). If young men playing video games are not foregoing their basic needs (an assumption we’ll make here), and the cost of media entertainment goods has dramatically fallen, then they must be trading off consumption goods. Next, we argue that this group has decreased consumption because the signaling utility of these goods has decreased.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-conspicuous-consumption-and-what-does-it-take-to-get-it">What is conspicuous consumption and what does it take to get it?</h4>

<p>Historically, the primary purpose of working was to generate enough income to satisfy basic needs. Once those needs were met, an individual had a tradeoff to make between spending their remaining time on work or leisure.</p>

<p>Observing the behavior of the nouveau riche in a post-industrialization society in the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen introduced the theory of conspicuous consumption - the purchase of goods and services for the sake of signalling social status (vs. the intrinsic function provided by goods that meet basic needs or those that enable leisure).</p>

<p>As living standards improved in the 20th century and individuals had more discretionary income, this behavior expanded to men, women, and children across all economic classes who began to spend more money on goods and services as a sort of social fashion. Implicit in spending more time on work is a preference for conspicuous consumption over leisure.</p>

<p>If you have the money, how do you decide what to consume? Benjamin Schwarz suggested in his <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-new-elites-silly-virtue-signaling-consumption/">review</a> of Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Small-Things-Theory-Aspirational/dp/0691162735">The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This process depends on the great extent to which the elite’s consumption is at once devoted to and relies on “cultural capital”—that is, the adoption of values, tastes, and norms through social inculcation and formal education. That cup of Intelligentsia coffee may “only” cost five dollars, but learning about it in the first place depends on prizing the judgment of certain cultural tastemakers (again, say, the New York Times and those right-thinking podcasts), and on possessing a worldview that attaches a particular value and virtue to a particular container of hot liquid. Acquiring that cultural capital is, itself, a rarefied and usually expensive endeavor, because it involves a lengthy and complex process of what the sociologists call cultural and social formation: The peculiar cachet that the educated class attaches to that cup of coffee is far more likely to elude the daughter of an insurance adjuster brought up in Lansing, Kansas (a middle-class suburb of Kansas City), who attended the local high school and Kansas State, than it is the daughter of a screenwriter raised in uber-achieving north-of-Montana-Avenue Santa Monica, who attended the Harvard-Westlake School and Yale. Thus, buying that cup of coffee—or that organic cotton t-shirt, or that subscription to Harper’s—signifies a class identity that the purchase, in turn, reinforces.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increased cost in time to acquire the knowledge of what to consume is yet another way that conspicuous consumption is becoming prohibitively more expensive.</p>

<p>The catch with all of this is that the psychological utility sought from conspicuous consumption is relative, not absolute. Sarah Perry sums this up nicely in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290">Every Cradle is a Grave</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than anything, however, a human utility function is a function of social belonging. That’s the ultimate point not only of income, but of intelligence, beauty, and many other material and non-material goods: they may be traded for social belonging… We want income because we want to be able to get the attention of others. We want a safe social place, primarily—and, of course, we want a better social place than the one we currently occupy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication of this relative sizing up is that there is an ever-rising bar to maintain or improve your social position relative to the people and communities from which you seek affiliation or belonging. This was never easy given the money and time required, but at least …</p></article></div>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Ever since&nbsp;Google&nbsp;published the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="SRE movemen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/06/26/cloud-service-reliability-part-i-apollo-13-to-google-sre/" target="_blank">SRE movemen</a>t has changed how organizations look at&nbsp;reliability, and incident response and management. Not unlike DevOps, working on adopting SRE is resulting in an organizational cultural shift. A shift which is changing how organizations are organized, on how information flows within an organization that would allow for the delivery of more reliable and resilient, dynamic systems. That being said, SRE, that is SRE as defined by Google, is not applicable for most organizations. Organizations need to take the thought process and culture behind Google’s SRE and adapt it just enough to make it suitable and viable for their organization’s business needs. As I see it today, large enterprises are mostly failing at doing this. They are either attempting to adopt SRE in its purest form, not realizing they are not Google, or totally changing (corrupting) it to suit how they do things, how they have always done things, to their broken culture, hence making what they call SRE, SRE in name only.</p>



<blockquote><p>“But, You are Not Google”</p><cite>Me talking to many a CIO/VP of Ops</cite></blockquote>



<p>“But, You are not Google”. This is a common refrain I have said to many a CIO or VP of Ops in companies that I have worked on SRE adoption with. I try to be polite, I promise. But really, they are not Google. In the very initial pages of the Google SRE book, in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/production-environment/" target="_blank">introduction</a> itself, the authors describes why Google developed SRE. They have massive data centers on which their services run. These data centers have a high incidence of hardware failure, given their size. This required Google to have the ability to dynamically move services from one part of the data center to another in a fraction of time. Given the large user base of the deployed services, Google also needed to have extremely fast response times to outages and degradation in quality of service, with minimal impact to the user. Their operations teams had to find a way to handle all these incidents, outages and failures in an automated manner to reduce toil and stress on the team. Their incidents, outages and failures were also very repetitive. Given the homogenous nature of the hardware across their datacenters, and the nature of the services deployed, there were very few outliers. Most tasks could (should) be automated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This led to the development of what we today know as SRE. Google had a team of software developers work in operations with the goal of developing software to handle the vast majority of tasks that were assigned to the system administration teams and incident response teams. As the software got more and more mature, more and more typical tasks had been automated. The humans could then focus on the outliers. On tasks that were not ‘typical’. Reliability Engineering meets software engineering = SRE.</p>



<p>If the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph in this section is not an apt description of your datacenters and systems you are running, you do not need SRE. Don’t get me wrong, you need (service/system) Reliability Engineering. You still need to automate repetitive, typical tasks in operations. You just don’t need to, and really should not do it the Google way. You are not Google. Very few organizations are.</p>



<h3><strong>SRE for the Enterprise</strong></h3>



<p>So what does SRE in the ‘regular’ Enterprise look like? It may be easier to describe what it does not look like. Here goes:</p>



<ul><li>You are not replacing your current Ops team, your sys admins with software Engineers. You need your ops team. They know how your custom built infrastructure and systems work. They know its idiosyncrasies. They know when Chicago opens to a ticket to say they are offline again, its the network. Yes, its always the network, but the sysadmins know who to ping at Equinix to get it restored pronto. They know how the option trade desk system slows to a grind on Expiration Friday and you just ignore those tickets from traders that day. And even if you wanted to get rid of all the sys admins, can you afford to hire that many software engineers to replace them all? You can barely fill all your open slots on the dev teams. What you need to do is complement your Ops teams with software engineers who can understand what the teams do day-in, day-out and what tasks are repetitive and typical, and then they can develop tools for automated remediation. These software engineers should be embedded in the ops team, not a separate team on the outside. Think <em>Squads.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE is a no-no.&nbsp;First of all <em>&lt;steps on soapbox/&gt;</em> there should NOT be a team called the DevOps team! You created a new silo to do what was supposed to be a movement to eliminate silos? DevOps should be what everyone does. If you do have a separate team to build automation, that is exactly what they are – the automation building team. And that is exactly what they should do – build automation for others to use. They build tools to enable the processes of DevOps. They do NOT use those tools themselves to do any real deployments. Ever. But I leave my true feelings on this for another blog post <em>&lt;steps off soapbox/&gt;</em>.&nbsp; Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE only gets them to leave for better jobs as real SREs elsewhere at better salaries now that they are formally SREs according to their resumes. Don’t do it. DevOps is DevOps. SRE is SRE. They are joined at the hip, but they are different. SREs have a different set of goals from the application development teams – build automation to reduce toil, increase observability, and improve reliability of the systems in production. They should not be building deployment automation or improving test environments to get better quality signals.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<ul><li>SRE is first and foremost about culture. Do you have a culture that is reliability focussed? What does reliability mean to you? Is it <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/08/18/cloud-service-reliability-part-3-antifragile-when-devops-met-sre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MTBF or MTTR (opens in a new tab)">MTBF or MTTR</a>? Do you have well defined SLAs (or SLOs)? How do you measure them? Do you meet them? Do you have <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2020/01/08/understanding-observability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Observability (opens in a new tab)">Observability</a>? Do you do blameless postmortems of incidents? Are they really blameless? Do you make your developers ‘carry pagers’ and do they do it without fear? Do you deploy on Fridays and sleep well over the weekend?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I am barely scratching the surface of how SRE needs to be adapted for the enterprise (that is not Google). I would like to hear from you. But instead of leaving a comment on this post, which I perfectly OK with, I would prefer you respond to an <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">SRE survey</a> we recently created. I had the opportunity earlier this year to work with three good friends of mine – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA2fPwBkGJsFLhm7pYTiGv1hOwqc3Vxt1I/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Marc Hornbeek</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADGJN4BvhODuicPVGeQAljiRCR_Vx66MQM/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Archana Joshi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJS7zgBfhzivo8mNgusFqmaicqG0wuPYww/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Niladri Choudhury</a> on a <em><a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">State of SRE</a></em> survey commissioned by <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/">Catchpoint</a>. This survey is designed specifically to get a view into how enterprises and other organization not named Google are adopting SRE. If your organization is adopting or thinking of adopting SRE, do take this survey right now. We will be analyzing the results and sharing findings on the current state and trends (this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Catchpoint is running a SRE survey) later this Spring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sweeten the deal, I am offering my time to anyone who completes the survey and wants to talk SRE. Once you complete the survey and want to talk about your SRE adoption or just have questions about SRE, <a href="mailto:sanjeev@sdarchtect.blog">email a screenshot of the completion screen to me</a> and I will schedule a <strong>free 20-minute consult with you and your team</strong>. So, what are you waiting for – click <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">here</a> to go to the survey. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

	  <p><span color="#51504E">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My 
		first rule of hitting was to get a good ball to hit. I learned down to 
		percentage points where those good balls were. The box shows my particular 
		preferences, from what I considered my “happy zone” - where I could hit 
		.400 or better - to the low outside corner - where the most I could hope 
		to bat was .230. Only when the situation demands it should a hitter go 
		for the low-percentage pitch.<p>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some players are better high-ball hitters than 
		low-ball hitters, or better outside than in; each batter should work out 
		his own set of percentages. But more important, each should learn the 
		strike zone, because once pitchers find a batter is going to swing at 
		bad pitches he will get nothing else. The strike zone is approximately 
		seven balls wide (allowing for pitches on the corners). When a batter 
		starts swinging at pitches just two inches out of that zone (shaded area), 
		he has increased the pitcher’s target from approximately 4.2 square feet 
		to about 5.8 square feet - an increase of 37 percent. Allow a pitcher

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this media release used a hypothetical example that suggested that Google used information about users’ health to personalise or target advertisements. Google says that it does not show personalised ads based on health information. This example has been removed from the media release.</em></p>

<p>The ACCC has launched Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC (Google), alleging Google misled Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers’ internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges Google misled consumers when it failed to properly inform consumers, and did not gain their explicit informed consent, about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers’ Google accounts with information about those individuals’ activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.</p>

<p>This meant this data about users’ non-Google online activity became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Previously, this information had been kept separately from users’ Google accounts, meaning the data was not linked to an individual user.</p>

<p>Google then used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC also alleges that Google misled consumers about a related change to its privacy policy.</p>

<p>“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Google significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers’ express informed consent,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from consumers to take this step.”</p>

<p>“The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits.”</p>

<p>“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the “price” of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>“I agree” notification</strong></p>

<p>The conduct is alleged to have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.</p>

<p>From 28 June 2016 until at least December 2018, Google account holders were prompted to click “I agree” to a pop-up notification from Google that purported to explain how it planned to combine their data, and sought the consumers’ consent for this.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some new features for your Google Account</em></p>

	<p><em>We’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notification also stated,&nbsp;<em>“More information will be available in your Google Account making it easier for you to review and control”</em>; and&nbsp;<em>“Google will use this information to make ads across the web more relevant for you.”</em></p>

<p>Before June 2016, Google only collected and used, for advertising purposes, personally identifiable information about Google account users’ activities on Google owned services and apps like Google Search and YouTube.</p>

<p>After June 2016, when consumers clicked on the “I agree” notification, Google began to collect and store a much wider range of personally identifiable information about the online activities of Google account holders, including their use of third-party sites and apps not owned by Google.</p>

<p>Previously, this additional data had been stored separately from a user’s Google account.</p>

<p>Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that the “I agree” notification was misleading, because consumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used, and so did not - and could not - give informed consent.</p>

<p>“We believe that many consumers, if given an informed choice, may have refused Google permission to combine and use such a wide array of their personal information for Google’s own financial benefit,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy change</strong></p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy that it&nbsp;<em>“will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement:<em>&nbsp;“[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy also states:&nbsp;<em>“[w]e will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.”</em></p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that Google did not in fact obtain consumers’ explicit consent for this change to the privacy policy, and that Google’s statement that it would not reduce consumers’ rights without their explicit consent was therefore misleading.</p>

<p>“Google made a clear representation about how it would protect users’ privacy. The ACCC alleges that Google made changes without obtaining the explicit consent it had promised consumers it would obtain before altering how it protected their private information,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick</strong></p>

<p>In 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Google now supplies DoubleClick’s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, which are the leading suppliers of ad-tech intermediary services.</p>

<p>These services track users’ internet activity on third-party sites that display ads through the use of DoubleClick’s advertising technology.</p>

<p>Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick required approval by competition authorities including the US Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. The ACCC also reviewed and cleared this transaction.</p>

<p>FTC and EC cleared the acquisition, and in doing so considered submissions from Google that it would not be able to combine DoubleClick’s data on consumers’ internet activity with its own data about consumers’ activity on Google services because, at the time, DoubleClick’s contracts with its users prevented Google from doing so.</p>

<p>The agencies did not, however, rely on these submissions in clearing the acquisition.</p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google collected and stored this information on a non-personally identifiable basis, as stated in its privacy policy.</p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, it changed its privacy policy by removing the term explaining how it would treat this DoubleClick data.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the device and Google service being used by the consumer, the notification published by Google from 28 June 2016 was presented in a variety of ways. A copy of the notification in the form published to consumers using desktop devices is provided below for reference.</p>

<p>I bit the bullet and reformatted my MacBook Pro over the weekend. My motivation for doing this was to start from scratch to figure out what apps I need. I’m documenting the process I followed here. This guide is a work-in-progress.</p>



<h3>Backing Up My Files</h3>



<p>I wanted to keep it simple and work on organizing all of my files later. So I used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to do the hard work with backing up all my files over to my Drobo 5N. This took longer than I expected, so be patient.</p>



<h3>Signing Out</h3>



<p>You’ll need to make sure you sign out and deauthorize applications before you reformat.</p>



<h3>Installing Applications and Configuring</h3>



<p>Since I’m a developer, I’m always on the lookout for MacBook setup guides. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/" target="_blank">this</a> impressive guide by Tania Rascia and was inspired to make my own. </p>



<p>After installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, here are the apps I installed.</p>



<pre><code>brew install \
  git \
  yarn \
  make 

brew cask install 1password bartender brave-browser carbon-copy-cloner cleanmymac cleanshot screenflow visual-studio-code google-chrome firefox iterm2 docker vlc slack keybase postgres postico postman coda malwarebytes steam dotnet-sdk
</code></pre>



<p>Since I needed to install Mac Store apps, I installed and used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" target="_blank">mas-cli</a>.</p>



<pre><code>brew install mas</code></pre>



<pre><code>mas install 937984704 1091189122 775737590 634148309 441258766 1274495053 568494494 485812721 497799835

# Amphetamine
# Bear
# iA Writer  
# Logic Pro X
# Magnet
# Microsoft To Do 
# Pocket
# TweetDeck
# Xcode</code></pre>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cask-versions</a> to install alternative versions of applications that I haven’t upgraded like Alfred.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions</code></pre>



<pre><code>brew cask install alfred3 # then activated my power pack license</code></pre>



<p>Turn off spotlight keyboard shortcut and set keyboard shortcut to <code>CMD + spacebar</code> for Alfred.</p>



<h3>iTerm2 Setup</h3>



<p>I followed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070" target="_blank">this</a> to setup my iTerm2.</p>



<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>



<pre><code>{
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
    "workbench.colorTheme": "New Moon",
    "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",
    "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "terminal.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminal.background": "#002833",
        "terminal.ansiBlack": "#003541",

        "terminal.ansiBrightWhite": "#fdf6e3",
        "terminal.ansiBrightYellow": "#657b83",
        "terminalCursor.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminalCursor.background": "#003541"
    }
}</code></pre>



<h3>Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects</h3>



<p>I recommend using Stuart Ellis’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/#setting-up-a-directory-structure-for-projects" target="_blank">directory structure</a> for projects, which looks like this for me.</p>



<pre><code>code/

    github.com/
      westerncj/
        a-project/
    gitlab.com/
      cwestern/

      <div>
  
  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Dependency Inject (DI) is one of the most notable practices to create reliable and high-quality software. This effort enables us to keep the extensibility without losing readability and testability. You may have encountered a situation where you would want to replace any objects in the software flexibly like me. Many frameworks or libraries are allowing us to make use of the dependency injection in our software project. In my case, I would like to use <a href="https://dagger.dev/">Dagger</a> in our web application using <a href="https://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a>. But I was ignorant of what Dagger was and how to use it in our Dropwizard project. Hence, this article is for writing down the process to get started with Dagger in your web application using Dropwizard.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dagger">What is Dagger</h2>

<p>First of all, what is Dagger? Dagger is a Java-based dependency injection library originally invented by <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. For now, it’s mainly maintained by Google as an open-source project.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lewuathe.com/assets/img/posts/2020-07-24-how-to-inject-jersey-resource-in-dropwizard-with-dagger/dagger.png" alt="Dagger"></p>

<p>You might hear about <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a> before, which is also maintained by Google. It has a more extended history than Dagger. Despite that, Dagger has a more significant number of stars in <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">its GitHub repository</a>. Why is Dagger more popular than Guice? There are several reasons from my perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dagger is compiling time DI library, while Guice’s injection happens at runtime</li>
  <li>Guice often causes challenging error to solve relating to its reflection usage</li>
  <li>Dagger provides more simple APIs to use</li>
  <li>Dagger has notable use cases due to the adoption in the Android development</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I try to use Dagger in our web application this time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-integrate-dagger-in-dropwizard-project">How to integrate Dagger in Dropwizard project</h2>

<p>What I’m going to do is integrate Dagger in a Dropwizard project to inject Jersey resources flexibly. Before going deeper into this goal, we need to be familiar with some Dagger terminologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Module</code>: Has associations between the interface and actual injected objects.</li>
  <li><code>Component</code>: Constructs a whole graph resolving the dependencies of injected objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Guice, what I’ve found is that we needed to construct one more class called <code>Component</code>. The component is a sort of highest level class managing all objects injected by Dagger. Therefore, all objects should be injected from the component.</p>

<p>In our case, we will create <code>WebResourceModule</code> for the module and <code>WebappComponent</code> for the component.</p>

<p>The client of the injected class can use the <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> annotation. Constructor injection or field injection is recommended in Dagger.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/users"</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>UserResource</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>@Inject</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>UserResource</span><span>(</span><span>UserConfig</span> <span>userConfig</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Used for the user resource specific configuration</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are going to inject <code>UserConfig</code> as we like by using Dagger.</p>

<p>The dagger library can be imported with the following code in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>implementation</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.28.1'</span>
  <span>annotationProcessor</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.28.1'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="module-and-component">Module and Component</h2>

<p>First, we define the module to illustrate how to construct the target <code>UserConfig</code> class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Module</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dagger.Provides</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Module</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>UserConfig</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>configuration</span><span>.</span><span>getUserConfig</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@Provides</span>
    <span>UserConfig</span> <span>provideUserConfig</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>@Provides</code> annotation lets the compiler know how to construct the class at the compile time. Therefore, all classes in the application use the <code>UserConfig</code> constructed by the method, <code>provideUserConfig</code>. Next, we can create a module class for building the whole dependency graph.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Component</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Component</span><span>(</span><span>modules</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>WebResourceModule</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>})</span>
<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>UserResource</span> <span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The argument of <code>@Component</code> annotation specifies the modules knowing how to construct the injected objects. All <code>WebappComponent</code> interface needs to provide is the method to build the object we finally want to get. In this case, the web resource which will be registered into the Dropwizard later. That’s all that we must do with Dagger.</p>

<p>But here comes one question. Who creates the instance of <code>WebappComponent</code>? The answer is Dagger. Dagger generates a class prefixed by <code>Dagger</code>. In this case, <code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> will be created to construct the <code>UserResource</code> from it. Additionally, it provides us a way to bind a module at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="dropwizard-application">Dropwizard Application</h2>

<p>In the Dropwizard, we will get the component class to get the <code>UserResource</code> and register it as a jersey resource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Application</span> <span>extends</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>dropwizard</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Configuration</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Application</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Override</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>@NotNull</span> <span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>,</span> <span>Environment</span> <span>environment</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Bind the module to inject the user configuration</span>
    <span>// All objects dependent on the UserConfig can change the behavior without rewriting them.</span>
    <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>component</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                                <span>new</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

    <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>jersey</span><span>().</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>component</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> has a builder interface to bind the module at runtime. By changing the module here, we can change the behavior. For the test purpose, we can write a component like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WebappComponent</span> <span>testComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                            <span>new</span> <span>TestWebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

<span>UserResource</span> <span>testUserResource</span> <span>=</span> <span>testComponent</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It obviously helps us write more testable code.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>

<p>As we saw now, using a Dagger looks easy. Dagger enabled me to write more maintainable code without learning many things. Its simple APIs significantly reduce the trouble and burden to employ the DI framework in our software projects. Let’s try to use Dagger in your Dropwizard project as well!</p>

I wasn’t meant for educators, as those are actually their issues with me (i.e. teaching disabilities).”</p><p>He’s an inspiration as I’ve faced similar obstacles especially with the focus of compliance in the educational system over creativity, curiosity, even intellect has <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">hurt me in my educational career</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p>I started writing these <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">essays</a> and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU87CN_FxGC1q3hzWM0CCDA" target="_blank">videos</a> because <strong>ideas are the currency of the 21st century. </strong>I humbly believe the ideas I share could help others as I pursue my <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.substack.com/" target="_blank">Curiosities</a><em>.</em></p><p>Eric Weinstein’s ideas have awakened me and showed a world unknown to most people, such as the real world of academia and science.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these ideas is what he calls the <strong>DISC</strong> (Distributed Idea Suppression Complex) which explains how disruptive and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are suppressed. Keeping institutions safe from individuals who create change.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is spread throughout major institutions such as in academia, the mainstream media, and politics. It tries to undermine ideas that may challenge or weaken the elite. This isn’t directly planned, and it’s not under central control.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric and his family have been victims of the DISC multiple times. Eric in physics, his wife in economics, and his brother in biology. He started noticing the same pattern in politics when MSNBC hid polling graphics of presidential candidate Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is only one of these marvelous ideas that Eric explores in his podcast called The Portal where he explores subjects including science, economics, culture, politics, and business.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the show is to help you see the world through a different lens, which opens up your mind to new ways of viewing events and your life. Each guest is a portal to a reality showcasing what we would normally consider impossible, are indeed possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s visit The Portal!</p><h2>Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Eric launched The Portal in June 2019 and less than a year later has created a community of people who want to explore this hidden reality and discover new portals.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric has wide expertise in many fields, but what’s interesting is how he engages your mind, moves your heart, and lights a spark in your soul. Eric can discover unexplored worlds and bring them back to his audience. Sometimes, complex or hard to understand, but always interesting where you get the sense of upgrading your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my favorite episodes:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s" target="_blank"><strong>1: Peter Thiel:</strong></a><strong> </strong>this was how I found the podcast. Peter rarely appears on interviews, so I knew this one had to be special. Peter Thiel is one of the most influential and contrarian thinkers of the last decades. He’s also the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir. He was also the first big investor in Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Eric challenge our way of thinking and encourage us to see things differently. For instance, they discussed the relationship between growth and violence. Thiel argues that if economic growth is low, violence is more likely to arise. He highlights that violence among humans is high because according to Rene Girard, we want what other people want, giving rise to conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>This may be one of the best episodes in the history of podcasts. I found this conversion can help you understand Girard’s theories' implications in society, especially in a time of wealth gap inequality, racial conflicts, and a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>They also discussed the era of stagnation, the future of education, student debt, the broken world of academia, and polymaths.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter (a conservative) and Eric (a progressive) discuss ideas with unique and often opposing views as they try to find a solution and reach an agreement on his arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000462975502" target="_blank"><strong>19: Bret Weinstein - The Prediction and the DISC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In this rigid conversation with Bret, they talked about the DISC and how it affected Bret with one of his biology discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Eric eagerly tries to get his brother to tell the story of his powerful finding. Bret discovered that the mice we use for medical trials have ultra-long telomeres (something humans don’t have) and that these “hide” the dangers of certain medicines. This same discovery could cure cancer and end aging.&nbsp;</p><p>After he discovered this, he tried to go the usual path of peer-review and so on. According to the podcast, he was silenced. Yet his findings were taken and made someone else the Nobel Prize winner.&nbsp;</p><p>A mind-blowing episode that will stir your curiosity and make you learn about the findings, the DISC, and The Portal.</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000460365533" target="_blank"><strong>17: Anna Khachiyan - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine From The Ashes Of “The Feminine Mystique”:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Eric interviews Anna, who is a Russian-American social, literary and artistic theorist. She is also the co-host of the fierce and popular Red Scare podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the conversation, Eric tells her, “I've been addicted to your podcast not quite understanding why. It's one of the strangest things I've ever found.” That’s exactly how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about mystery and how society thought we wanted clarity and directness. But what we actually want is mystery, especially in our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they talked about the importance of mystery and what it means to be mysterious. This episode will help you perceive the significance of how we can use mystery in our lives.</p><p>I’ll be honest, I don’t know why I liked this episode, but I listened to it several times and it was weirdly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS </strong><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000477637846" target="_blank"><strong>36: Dark Matter, Black Matters and All That Jazz</strong></a><strong> </strong>with Stephon Alexander is an amazing episode to learn more about physics, racial issues, and music.&nbsp;</p><h2>Geometrically Unified</h2><p>I disagree with many of Eric’s views, however I still consider him a role model because of his love and passion for science. He proposed a theory of everything called Geometric Unity where he tried to explain and combine all physical aspects of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>I love learning about science. I read books, email experts, watch interviews, write essays, and listen to podcasts like The Portal to learn more about science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Science</strong> combined with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> has the power to create a world of progress and technological advancement, so we create a world of equality, fairness, and peace.&nbsp; That’s what I hope to do with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you find Eric’s work as interesting, fascinating, and curious as I have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank">Jen</a>, <a href="https://salman.io/" target="_blank">Salman</a>, <a href="https://juliasaxena.com/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://fullofkrapp.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>  for reading drafts of this essay. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595770382135_5451"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>newsletter</strong></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. <br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>I manage this website with markdown and a shell scripts. Hereâ€™s how.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast load time</li>
<li>Minimal Interface</li>
<li>A site directory</li>
<li>Readable URLs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>A fancy framework</li>
<li>Site analytics/admin interface</li>
<li>Large files</li>
<li>Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent some time in HTML/CSS designing a header for the site. This includes a generic title for each page, an â€œAboutâ€� tab, â€œPostsâ€� tab, â€œContactâ€� tab, and horizontal bar to separate the header from the body. I linked each tab to the URL I planned for each page, which is my domain (jarbus.net) followed by the filename with the <code>.html</code> extension removed. (e.g.Â&nbsp;jarbus.net/About)</p>
<p>I write all my posts in markdown, then convert it to HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a conversion script to turn an HTML file for a post into an HTML file for the site. I accomplish this by creating a new file consisting of the header HTML mentioned, concatenating with the post HTML afterwards. I also run a <code>sed</code> command to replace the generic title in the header for the filename of the post, with dashes replaced with spaces.</p>
<p>I keep my markdown files in a directory called â€œdraftsâ€�, which is sibling to the GitHub Pages repository thatâ€™s hosting my website. When Iâ€™m done with a post, I convert it to a site page, move it to the git repository, then push. Itâ€™s that easy!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/About">About</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/jarbus.net">Index</a>, and <a href="http://jarbus.net/Contact">Contact</a> pages all maintained as above. I used to have a script to automatically recreate my <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a> page to add new entries, but found that I much prefer the curated &amp; categorical page I have now.</p>

<p>I also have an <a href="http://jarbus.net/feed">rss feed</a>, which I update manually. However, given that adding a new entry simply requires putting</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
    PostName
  &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    https://www.jarbus.net/PostName
  &lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<p>at the top of my feed file, I think Iâ€™ll manage. Plus, I enjoy the ability add custom tags on a post by post basis if I decide to.</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with how the site turned outâ€“I have absolute control over all aspects of my blog while doing negligible content management. I have lighting-fast load times, a minimal interface, and can fix any aspect of my site were something to break.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This essay is an illustrated proof of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem; the NFL theorem has many variants, which all say slightly different things. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">most famous one</a> says, roughly, that every learning algorithm has the same performance, when averaged across all possible target functions. In other words, there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms every other algorithm on every learning task.</p>

<p>Throughout this essay, I'm going to be refering to a "learning algorithm". If you're unfamiliar, in the machine learning context, a learning algorithm is an algorithm that takes in \(S\), a series of (x,y) pairs, i.e. our training data or training set, from some target function and outputs a hypothesis, which is a function that tries to be close to the original target function. Note that the inputs and outputs aren't necessarily  binary, but it's easier to illustrate them as such, and the proof is not affected. Learning algorithms are often evaluated by looking at the error rate, which in the case of classification, is the proportion of \((x,y)\) pairs it predicts incorrectly.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/hypothesis.svg"></p>

<p>In this essay, I will focus on an easier NFL theorem (from <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/%7Eshais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David</a>) which says, roughly, for any learning algorithm that outputs a binary function, there exists a distribution that will cause it to output a hypothesis with a high error rate, even when there exists another function that can achieve 0 error on the distribution. In other words, for every learning algorithm, we can find a distribution that can trip up the learning algorithm.</p>

<p>How do we formalize this? </p>

<p>The NFL theorem we're going to prove states that:</p>

<p>Say we have a learning algorithm A which outputs a binary classifier (this is our hypothesis) over a domain \(X\). </p>

<p>Next, let's define an error or loss function, which will tell us how well our output hypothesis does on the actual distribution. We'll use the <strong>1</strong> loss function \(L\) which, when given two inputs, outputs 0 if the two values match, otherwise it outputs 1. Then, there exists a distribution \(D\) over \(X \times \{0,1\}\) (i.e. a distribution over possible \((x,\{0,1\})\) values) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There exists a function \(f: X \to \{0,1\}\) with \(L_D(f) = 0\). That is, there is some binary function over \(X\) such that the expected loss of \(f\) over \(D\) is 0. In other words, there is some function which will correctly classify all the points in our distribution correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>With probability of at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) over the choice of \(S \sim D^m\) \(L_D(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}\). In other words, for at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) of all possible training sets of size \(m\) from \(D\), the expected loss of output of the training algorithm on the training set is at least  \(\frac{1}{8}\). (Note that our loss function is defined here as the average <strong>1</strong> loss across all points in the distribution).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution \(D\) is defined over \(2m\) points, so our training set will consist of at most \(m\) unique values, i.e. half of the distribution's points. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/nfl-base.svg"></p>

<p>To prove this, we are actually going to prove something different, but equivalent. Instead, we are going to prove that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))] \ge 1/4\)</p>

<p>That is, if we run our learning algorithm on training sets of size \(m\), across a family of distributions \(D_1-D_T\), the largest such expected loss will be at least \(\frac{1}{4}\). In other words, we will show that at least one distribution \(D_i\) from this group will trip up our algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/dist-one-fourth-error.svg"></p>

<p>To see how these two statements are equivalent, we just apply a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markvov's inequality</a>. This lower bounds how likely a random variable is to be greater than some value:</p>

<p>\(P(X \ge a) \ge \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]-a}{1-a}\)</p>

<p>Applying that to our inequality above, we see that:</p>

<p>\(P(L_{D_i}(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}) \ge \frac{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}} \ge \frac{1}{7}\) as desired. So now we just need prove this new inequality.</p>

<p>Before that, here's the intuition for why this inequality is true:</p>

<p>First, our learning algorithm only gets half of all possible points as its training set. This means our algorithm knows nothing about the labels of the other half of the points. Now, if we assume that every function over these unknown points is equally likely, then each point is either 1 or a 0. This means that our algorithm can only guess for these unknown points, which makes its expected error rate 0.5. So in the best case, it'll still get an error rate of 0 on the half it sees and 0.5 on the half it doesn't see, which makes its overall error 0.25.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/seen-unseen-data.svg"></p>

<h3>The Proof</h3>

<p>Now, let's begin the proof.</p>

<p>Let \(C \subseteq X\) such that \(|C| = 2m\). So it's a subset of our input space that's of size \(2m\). </p>

<p>Notice that there are \(T = 2^{2m}\) possible functions from \(C\) to \(\{0,1\}\).  Let \(D_i\) be the distribution over \(D\) that only assigns probability to the \((x,f_i(x))\) pairs for the corresponding function. This captures the idea that our input space \(C\) is twice the size of our training set, and that each function is equally likely. </p>

<p>Each function is now turned into a probability distribution that places \(\frac{1}{|C|}\) probability if the given \((x,y)\) point is one of the function's input/output pairs, and 0 probability otherwise. So each unique function has a unique distribution associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/function-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Recall that we're trying to calculate \(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\), i.e. the expected loss over all possible training examples, with regards to the distribution that maximizes this loss. </p>

<p>For any given distribution,  \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\) is the loss for a given training set, averaged over all possible choices of training data. </p>

<p>If our input space consists of \(2m\) points and our training data consists of a sequence of \(m\) points, then there are \(k = (2m)^m\) possible sequences. </p>

<p>Below, we'll let \(S_j^i\) be the \(i^{th}\) possible sequence of training data, labeled with the \(j^{th}\) possible function. </p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sij.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus, we know that \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}}[L_{D_i}(A(S))] = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\). In other words, for any one given distribution of data, the expected loss of our learning algorithm (across all training data sets) is equal to the expected loss if we take \(m\) training points, averaged across all possible functions that could label the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-distr-error.svg"> </p>

<p>Recall that, from above, we care about taking the <strong>maximum</strong> error across all possible distributions; by definition, this will be at least as big as the <strong>average</strong> loss across all distributions. Thus, we know that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-distr-training.svg"> </p>

<p>Next, it doesn't really matter if we take the average over all distributions first or the average over all training sets first. Thus, we can switch the order of the summations to get the same value:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) =\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-training-distr.svg"></p>

<p>Now, if we're taking the loss averaged over all training data, notice that this will necessarily have to be at least as big as the loss given by the training data which leads to the <strong>smallest</strong> average loss. </p>

<p>Thus, we can replace our inequality with a smaller, simpler one. Our inequality has to be at least as large as the average loss (across all functions) when applied to that specific training set.</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \underset{j \in [k]}{\text{min }} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-training-error.svg"> </p>

<p>So we've been abstractly talking about the loss function for a while now. What does \(L_{D_i}(h)\) actually represent? We want it to be how well our hypothesis does on a specific distribution \(D_i\). One straightforward way to formalize this is to just go through all \((x,y)\) pairs in \(D_i\) and take the average <strong>1</strong> loss between \(y\) and \(h(x)\):</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss.svg"></p>

<p>Next, let's fix some \(j \in [k]\), which has \(m\) training examples given by \(S_j = (x_1,..,x_m)\). Let \((v_1, ...,v_p)\) be the examples in \(C\) (all data points) that <strong>aren't</strong> in \(S_j\). We can see that \(p \ge m\) because at most we have half the data from the distribution, which is when we have no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/p-data.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) =\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)] \ge \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss-p.svg"> </p>

<p>In other words, the average loss over all points in the distribution is at least half of the average loss over all points <strong>not</strong> in the training set. </p>

<p>Now, we can substitutue this in for \(L_{D_i}\) from our inequality earlier to get:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p>So now we're taking the loss across all functions, across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\). Like before, we can swap the order of the summations:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] =\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-p-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Once again, we can upper bound this inequality by noticing that the average loss across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\) and across all functions has to be at least the loss of the point \(v_r\) which we assume to be the point which gives the minimal loss:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] \ge \frac{1}{2}\underset{r \in [p]}{\text{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_r) \not= f_i(v_r)]\)</p>
