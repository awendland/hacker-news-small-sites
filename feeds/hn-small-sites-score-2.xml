<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, for which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              <div>
              <p>Developers spend most of their time reading code, understanding it and exploring other ways to use existing solutions. Frankly, in our profession, there is very little time on actually writing new libraries and creating new interfaces in real-life development. So it is quite important to have some help in the most common activities. <strong>Naming conventions</strong> is one such thing that improves readability and eases the usage cost if agreed upon and spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Some languages have their own special naming conventions that make sense. Haskell is among them. There are a bunch of naming patterns that are commonly used everywhere in the ecosystem (including the standard libraries) that may help you to recognise the function’s meaning without looking at its documentation and even its type! This ability is especially relevant because naming is one of the hardest development problems, so having some help and no-brainer rules to guide in this area improves everyone’s life.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore common naming conventions in Haskell together. It is going to be useful for both creators (library and API developers) and consumers (library users), as it establishes norms accepted in the libraries’ APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🦋 If you are interested in other conventions and best practices on how to write Haskell code, you can take a look at our <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="checked">Checked<a href="#checked">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the conventional and straightforward norms established in Haskell’s specifications and standards. Names in Haskell must satisfy the following simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types and typeclasses</strong> must start with an <em>uppercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Functions and variables</strong> must start with a <em>lowercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Top-level operator functions</strong> must start with any allowed symbol except for <code>:</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructors as operators</strong> must start with <code>:</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are in the specifications and therefore checked by the compiler. So if you try to break the naming rules, you will get errors during the compilation.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions follow the <strong>lowerCamelCase</strong> style and types follow the <strong>UpperCamelCase</strong> style. This is the de facto standard of writing code in Haskell, but using distinct styles doesn’t lead to a compiler error. Moreover, there are some testing libraries that use <em>snake_case </em>to discover tests automatically. However, you can restrict that with the Haskell tooling, e.g.&nbsp;HLint can check this for you.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are various details in the names that will give you hints on what the function does. We will walk through them to learn to recognise them all.</p>
<h2 id="type-variables">Type variables<a href="#type-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start our excursions with the type variables that are most commonly used in type signatures and definitions. Some variables represent particular meaning: it could be a typeclass-related convention or just a convenient shorter usage. But in any way, this information is useful to know while reading and writing types:</p>
<div>
<p><code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, …</p>
<div>
<p>Ordinary type variables with no particular meaning</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>f</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Functor</code> or <code>Applicative</code></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>m</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Monad</code> or <code>Semigroup</code>/<code>Monoid</code></p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>(&lt;&gt;) ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>e</code></p>
<div>
<p>Types representing errors</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>failures ::</span> [<span>Validation</span> e a] <span>-&gt;</span> [e]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>t</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Foldable</code> or <code>Traversable</code></p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>concat</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> t [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or types of kind <code>Type</code> (previously <code>*</code>)</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> (<span>t ::</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>Size</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>k</code></p>
<div>
<p>Kind</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k]) (<span>ys ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> [k]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="function-variables">Function variables<a href="#function-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The way we name arguments and variables in functions is also not accidental. They contain hints that make reading these variables used in function bodies easier. Variables in functions use the following established commonly used names:</p>
<div>
<p><code>l</code></p>
<p>Lists variable</p>
<p><code>(x:xs)</code> or <code>(y:ys)</code></p>
<div>
<p>Patterns for lists where <code>x</code> means a single x and <code>xs</code> means <em>many <code>x</code>s</em></p>
<p>Also used together with the previous one with as-patterns:</p>

</div>
<p><code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>h</code></p>
<div>
<p>Function arguments</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>p</code></p>
<div>
<p>Functions which are predicates (e.g.&nbsp;of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>)</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>bar ::</span> (<span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">bar p i <span>=</span> <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>n</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code></p>
<p>Miscellaneous counters</p>
<p><code>len</code></p>
<p>Container size</p>
<p><code>go</code></p>

</div>
<h2 id="suffixes">Suffixes<a href="#suffixes">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Suffix in a Haskell function can contain a lot of information about its purpose. Sometimes you would see multiple different suffixes simultaneously that combine the characteristics of each piece, so it is helpful to pay attention to that.</p>
<h4 id="apostrophe">Apostrophe ’<a href="#apostrophe">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The <code>'</code> symbol is used in the functions, for which there is a corresponding function without the apostrophe, e.g.&nbsp;<code>foo</code> and <code>foo'</code>.</p>
<p>The apostrophe at the end means that it’s a <strong>strict</strong> version of a similar function. Both functions must have the same type, but different implementations underneath. The only difference in their behaviour is that the one with the <code>'</code> symbol evaluates intermediate results more eagerly.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>foldMap</span><span>  ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>foldMap' ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, both functions have the same type. But <code>foldMap'</code> is more efficient and helps to avoid space leaks when monoidal operation <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is strict in both arguments.</p>
<h3 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses<a href="#typeclasses">🔗</a></h3>
<p>There is a group of symbols that is used to indicate that the function returns the value in some context. This suffix – an uppercase letter or word – tells us the typeclass this context should represent.</p>
<p>Meet the <code>FAM</code>ily 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦</p>
<h4 id="f">F<a href="#f">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>F</code> suggests that it works with <code>Functor</code>s in some way.</p>
<p>Such functions can have an alternative without the suffix <code>F</code>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers">containers</a> library:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">alter</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb12-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">alterF</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>    ::</span> (<span>Functor</span> f, <span>Ord</span> k)</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Maybe</span> a))</span>
<span id="cb13-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb13-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb13-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Map</span> k a)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, sometimes the suffix <code>F</code> has an alternative meaning. <code>F</code> frequently used as a suffix in formatting libraries to indicate that a function is a <em>formatter</em> or a <em>pretty-printer</em>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt">fmt</a> library:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>timeF ::</span> <span>FormatTime</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BuilderSource</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see how the same naming can have different meanings. What’s important is that the library establishes its naming convention explicitly and uses it consistently.</p>
<h4 id="a">A<a href="#a">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>A</code> means that the function works with some general <code>Applicative</code> type (the type that has the <code>Applicative</code> instance).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>sequenceA</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Traversable</span> t, <span>Applicative</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> t (f a) <span>-&gt;</span> f (t a)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="m">M<a href="#m">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>M</code> is among the most common ones. It usually means that the function works with the <code>Monad</code>s or in the monadic context.</p>
<p>Similarly to the previous suffixes, functions <em>with</em> <code>M</code> have their counterparts <em>without</em> <code>M</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>filter</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">filterM</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> m</span>
<span id="cb17-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb17-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> m [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Historically, the standard Haskell library <code>base</code> didn’t have <code>Applicative</code> functors, and there weren’t the superclass of Monads. But now the suffix <code>M</code> is also sometimes used with Applicative functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="underscore-_">Underscore _<a href="#underscore-_">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Underscore, as a suffix of functions, also has a special meaning. It gives us a clue that the function works exactly as the one without <code>_</code> but discards the result (returns <code>()</code> instead).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">concurrently</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb18-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> (a, b)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">concurrently_</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="number">Number<a href="#number">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can often see the series of functions with the numbers at the end of their names. These groups have the same initial part but differ with the number. Numbers there represent the <strong>number of arguments</strong> each function takes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔢 The number 1 is not used usually in that meaning as it’s redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>liftA  ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f</span>
<span id="cb20-2">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)</span>

<p>Though, the fact that it works with <code>Foldable</code> is not ideal. There is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13573">a proposal</a> to implement a typeclass called <code>Foldable</code> (or <code>Semifoldable</code>) for non-empty types.</p>
<h3 id="lr">L/R<a href="#lr">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The suffixes <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (sometimes <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>) represent the direction of function application or order of traversing a data structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Most of the time, these sibling functions have the same type, but in some functions, certain arguments are reversed for convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>foldr</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb27-2"><span>foldl</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb27-3"></span>
<span id="cb27-4"><span>scanr</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>scanl</span><span> ::</span> (b <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6"></span>
<span id="cb27-7"><span>mapAccumR ::</span> <span>Traversable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, c)) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> t b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, t c)</span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>mapAccumL ::</span> <span>Traversable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, c)) <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> t b <span>-&gt;</span> (a, t c)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="byon">By/On<a href="#byon">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some of the overloaded functions that work with <code>Foldable</code>s or lists have a non-overloaded sibling with the suffix <code>By</code>.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to use these functions together with <code>on</code>, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">sortBy (<span>compare</span> <span>`on`</span> <span>fst</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This <code>on</code> pattern is so widely used, so functions also have the suffix <code>On</code>.</p>
<p>Compare these three types:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1"><span>sort</span></span>
<span id="cb29-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a</span>
<span id="cb29-3"></span>
<span id="cb29-4">    <span>=&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb29-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb30"><pre><code><span id="cb30-1">sortBy</span>
<span id="cb30-2"></span>
<span id="cb30-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Ordering</span>)</span>
<span id="cb30-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb30-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb31"><pre><code><span id="cb31-1">sortOn</span>
<span id="cb31-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> b</span>
<span id="cb31-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb31-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb31-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="p">P<a href="#p">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In some libraries or applications’ code, the suffix <code>P</code> shows that the function is a parser of some type, e.g.&nbsp;when using the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> library. The usage of this naming convention can look like this:</p>
<div id="cb32"><pre><code><span id="cb32-1"><span>data</span> <span>Config</span> <span>=</span> <span>Config</span></span>
<span id="cb32-2">    {<span> configPort ::</span> <span>Port</span></span>
<span id="cb32-3">    ,<span> configPath ::</span> <span>FilePath</span></span>
<span id="cb32-4">    }</span>
<span id="cb32-5"></span>
<span id="cb32-6"><span>portP ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>Port</span></span>
<span id="cb32-7"><span>pathP ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>FilePath</span></span>
<span id="cb32-8"></span>
<span id="cb32-9"><span>configP ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>Config</span></span>
<span id="cb32-10">configP <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>

                <div>
                    <p><strong>Confusing UI design = Recipe for Disaster</strong> – &nbsp;Setting up 2FA on our PayPal business account was exactly that. Usually most payment providers make 2FA a mandate in the setup process, or, at least asks its users to set it up during sign up itself, but PayPal doesn't. I have no complaints about PayPal's Infosec standards as they have been running a successful bug bounty program on Hackerone and seem to have a very responsive and active security team. </p><h2 id="update">Update</h2><p>We did some more research and found out this problem has been there for more than 2 years now yet no action from PayPal's end – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth">https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth</a></p><p>We haven't received any response from PayPal yet but have gotten in touch with them regarding the same.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 1525w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Users complaining about the issue on PayPal</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2fa-and-account-compromise">2FA and Account Compromise</h2><p>Setting up 2FA is really critical for account security, and PayPal accounts are no different – naturally, they are a more interesting target for hackers due to the price tag attached to them. Thus, enabling 2FA in the first place would be the most logical step to prevent unauthorized account intrusions and account hacks, as every log in would require a TOTP code from an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or, Authy as part of the 2FA process. However, I found this process really hard due to the confusing documentation on PayPal website. </p><p>The process to setup 2FA on PayPal for account security was by far the most difficult, time consuming and confusing process ever but when we get to it... you can realize how simple it could have actually been. Its the most important step to take to prevent getting your PayPal account hacked or, breached or, compromised. In this post, I have explained the full process and why it was so confusing.</p><p>PayPal's confusing UI design can become a threat to user account security &nbsp;as it makes it harder for users to setup 2FA for their accounts.</p><p>But it was, really... I mean <strong>REALLY</strong> difficult for me to locate their 2FA option. I couldn't spot it anywhere in their UI even after several Google searches about this, nothing showed up – whatever did was either too outdated or, totally useless or, deprecated. </p><p>Confused, I got in touch with their Customer Support who pointed me to their the <strong>Settings </strong>page, and told a <strong>Security </strong>page was located there. But... what? I couldn't find one. Weird, that's how difficult PayPal makes it to simply add an additional layer of security to your account. This made me wonder, why is it so difficult to enable a simple security feature like 2FA on PayPal? I tried everything, every button and navigation links on their Android and iOS apps too but failed to locate the 2FA setup page.</p><p>Utterly disappointed, when I came across <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">this</a> Help Center Article which was disguised in the form of a general FAQ about 2FA but, finally I found that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">magic link</a>! – </p><figure><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete"><div><p>what-is-2-step-verification</p><p><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/icon/pp196.png"></p></div></a></figure><p>Well, there's a catch. </p><h2 id="the-catch">The Catch</h2><p>When you are <strong>logged out</strong>, PayPal would show the following 2FA Setup process instructions in their <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">Documentation/Help Guide</a> – </strong></p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-out 2FA Setup Guide</figcaption></figure><p>However, when you are <strong>logged in, </strong>the instructions asked you to go to profile page and setup 2FA from there – <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">this</a> is the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">final link</a> that leads to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">2FA setup process</a>. This is <strong>how simple it could have been, </strong>but confusing documentation on the help pages and equally misleading instructions given by customer support made the process incredibly hard and confusing!</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1715w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-in Profile Page for 2FA Setup</figcaption></figure><h2 id="steps-to-setup-or-add-2fa-to-your-paypal-account-business-account-users-">Steps to setup or, add 2FA to your PayPal account (Business account users)</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Update</strong> after navigating to <strong>Login and Security</strong> page from PayPal Profile page navigation</li>
<li>After clicking on Update, choose your 2FA option. <strong>Choose Authenticator</strong> which is more secure than mobile phone based 2FA. I prefer <strong>Authy</strong>. PayPal 2FA should work with most TOTP authenticator apps.</li>
<li>Scan the code with your Authenticator app or, manually enter the code</li>
<li>Enter the TOTP code on PayPal website after adding PayPal in the Authenticator app,</li>
<li>You have succesffully added 2FA to your PayPal account. To make it more secure, you can go ahead and add SMS 2FA layer as extra defence too.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Turns out PayPal might have done some UI revamping which effectively resulted in concealing the <strong>Security </strong>page's navigation from Account Settings page. The whole thing was pretty troublesome for me. But now that I was able to setup 2FA back again, I have got back my peace of mind back!</p><h3 id="how-the-paypal-cs-reacted">How the PayPal CS reacted</h3><p>However, for me it was even more disappointing was when even their customer support staff too failed to guide me in this regard – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-3.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-3.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-3.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png 1737w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>PayPal Customer Support's response</figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-2fa-setup-available-in-paypal-mobile-apps">No 2FA Setup available in PayPal Mobile Apps</h2><p>When I last checked, there was no 2FA setup option in the mobile app UI which is an eye sore. Every major payment provider allows merchants and business users to setup 2FA right from the mobile – but I couldn't find the option in either of the apps – neither Android nor iOS which is bad from a security and accessibility standpoint.</p><h2 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h2><p>PayPal itself isn't insecure but these are what I call – classic business logic errors. The UI is the first step towards making a better application and give an overall good experience to the average consumer. Secondly, I had to face a not-so knowledgeable customer support staff who explained how to <strong>navigate to 2FA setup, </strong>but turns out that's not the actual way. I have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars <em>over</em>paying PayPal fees and this is what I get in terms of value for money or, my ROI, a bad user experience (UX). I'm not blaming anyone – but despite charging so much in fees, PayPal still hasn't been able to provide a proper UI/UX to its clients. There are several pain points in their UI, and nothing much has changed in most critical parts of their web app since the past 10-12 years, only some parts of the UI/UX has been revamped but some <strong>areas </strong>like 2FA setup are harder because of PayPal's extremely clunky and confusing UI.</p><p>If app developers don't design the UI properly, they can unintentionally cause losses on the part of their users – as in this case, a legitimate user couldn't setup 2FA on their account due to a buggy UI. I strongly feel UI and UX form a core part of an Application's security and not just the backend and frontend parts involving code. <strong>The UI features should encourage the user to enable more security features in the app, </strong>but in this case – it was misleading and confusing.</p><h2 id="harder-ui-more-security-issues-effectively">Harder UI = More Security Issues, effectively</h2><p>With harder UI in fine grained applications with varying levels of access controls, it becomes increasingly harder for users to manage account restrictions and security policies. As in this example, the <strong>Security </strong>page was hidden from the view which potentially makes a user account more susceptible to compromise. A better and smooth UI ensures a user is able to setup every security setting to optimal level. </p><p>Harder the UI = More the confusion on the part of the user. This can leave organization accounts open to breaches and evidently a lot of hackers are exploiting misconfigurations in application due to user ignorance.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>The entire process was far more painstaking and confusing, than how simple it should have been on the contrary. Thus, making a more intuitive and proper UI is very important from user security point of view than a confusing feature-loaded loosely designed product. Also, security features like 2FA should be mandated in applications dealing with payments and high value transactions in general. Due to a UI revamp or, refactor, that missed putting into place the Security link in Navigation, users can miss the 2FA setup and for those using weak credentials can end up getting hand – which is how hundreds of thousands of PayPal accounts and Credit Card &nbsp;data aka <strong>Fullz </strong>end up getting hacked and sold on darknet marketplaces.</p><blockquote><em><strong>How we can help?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong><a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a></strong> conducts in-depth security research, bug hunting, and security consultancy.

December 14, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-dap-mode">emacs dap-mode</h2>
<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h3 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

                            <div>
                                
<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg 1000w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-100x56.jpg 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-700x394.jpg 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></figure></div>



<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>

<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>

<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>

<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

          <h2>How to speed up long-distance HTTP file downloads by 6x</h2>
	  <p><small>10-12-2020</small></p>
          <hr>
          <p>The vast majority of HTTP communications use the TCP protocol to transfer data. TCP connections deliver data in-order and without message loss through the use of retransmits and message buffers. Since buffers need to store all sent messages before they are acknowledged, the maximum achievable throughput of a TCP connection is calculatable by a function of buffer size and latency. In long distance communications, this maximum throughput is often lower than the line speed, slowing down the connection on a line that could support faster communications. In this article we explore what impact these buffers have on TCP connection throughput in Linux for HTTP file downloads, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 6x over Ubuntu defaults on a connection with a 200ms ping.</p>

<pre><code>sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"</code></pre>
<p>Running the above script on both the client and server will increase download throughput on long distance at the cost of increased memory usage (up to 8GB of memory allocated across all TCP streams) on both the server and client.</p>


<p>The TCP protocol guarentees lossless in-order communication through the use of receive and transmit buffers, memory dedicated to holding the contents of messages which have not finished processing yet. The receive buffers store fragments of messages received out of order until all preceeding data is accounted for, while transmit buffers store messages that have been sent but are not yet acknowledged, in case they need to be retransmitted. Typically these buffers are allocated a finite amount of memory per-stream by an operating system, and exhaustion of these buffers leads to stalled connections and overall lower throughput.</p>
<p>Latency, the time it takes for a message transmitted to be received, is particularly good at triggering the exhaustion of TCP connection buffers. Every message sent by a TCP connection must be acknowledged by the receiving side before it can be removed from the sender's transmit buffer, which means that even in ideal conditions a single round trip must take place before a slot in the transmit buffer can be freed. If the buffer is exhausted then the sender will stall, since no new messages can be added to the transmit buffer. As such, when sending lots of data long-distance, the maximum achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>buffer size in bytes * (1 / latency in seconds)</code></pre>
<p>This bottleneck, plus the fairly opaque relationship between buffer size, latency, and overall connection throughput, can often make users believe that their internet connection is slow, when really they have just failed to allocate enough memory to take full advantage of the bandwidth they have available.</p>
<p>NOTE: Arrangement of TCP windows is a component of the TCP protocol we will gloss over today. TCP connections communicate their buffer sizes as windows, so that the other end of a connection does not overwhelm them with too much data. On Linux, the window size communicated is decided by the memory allowed to be allocated to a single TCP connection.</p>


<p>In this experiment we demonstrate the impact that TCP buffer sizes have on long-distance TCP connection throughput by configuring buffer sizes on a Linux (Ubuntu) server and client. To do this we download a randomly generated file over a server hosted in Germany from a client in Hong Kong (~200ms ping). Linux allows users to change the minimum, maximum, and default amount of memory allocated to each TCP stream. Most distributions set low limits by default in order to preserve system resources. In our experiment we show that the impact of increasing these values on both the client and server can be quite dramatic, demonstrating up to a 6x increase in HTTP download speed.</p>

<h2>Low Defaults</h2>
<p>This work was motivated after observing that the Debian and Ubuntu default buffer sizes seemed to be set too low. At time of writing the TCP sysctl settings on my Regolith Linux (Ubuntu derived distribution) were set to:</p>
<pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 4194304</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms, this allows for a 6MB receive buffer and a 4MB send buffer. Thus, by the formula above our total achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>600000 * (1/0.2) = ~3MB/s = ~50Mbps</code></pre>
<p>This total achievable throughput is a far cry from the potential of our gigabit network, which should enable transfers at nearly 125MB/s.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>We configure two Linux machines (Ubuntu Server), one acting as a client and one acting as a webserver. The server machine has the maximum buffer sizes enabled and a large file to download hosted via NGINX. Both our client and server have 1Gbps internet links, with the client located in Hong Kong and the server in Germany.</p>
<p>For each buffer size we set the client's transmit and receive TCP buffer limit and default to the specified size, but we do not change other TCP settings. For these tests we use the default TCP congestion profile on Ubuntu (cubic) and have default settings for TCP slow start.</p>
<p>To test bandwidth we set the large file downloading with a time limit of ten minutes. As the file downloads we the average throughput. To automate this test we use the following scripts:</p>
<pre><code># run_tests
while read p; do
  echo "# Starting test with $p"
  ./configure_settings "${p}"

  echo "# Sleeping"
  sleep 240

  echo "# Going"
  timeout 10m curl http://dev.parsed.uk/file.data --output /dev/null

done &lt; test.txt </code></pre>
<p>This script sequentially executes the same test with different test configurations loaded from test.txt.</p>

<pre><code># prepare for test
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1</code></pre>
<p>This script sets the TCP parameters for the test. The scripts are available on Github <a href="https://github.com/jawline/tcp-test-configuration">here</a>. We allowed a four minute period between setting sysctl settings and beginning the test to allow for the TCP settings to properly apply.</p>

<h2>Results &amp; Conclusions</h2>

<p>From our results we see that the TCP buffer sizes have a significant impact on throughput long distance. The maximum throughput observed during testing (21MB/s) was over 6x faster than the throughput for the client with a default configuration (~3-4MB/s). We observe that increases in buffer size correlate with increased in throughput until we reach 64MB TCP buffers. In our tests we see throughput peak at 21MB/s, and see no further gain in increasing buffer sizes beyond this. This is likely a limitation of one of the two servers, or the network that links them together. If our testing was not limited by other factors, we should observe further increases in performance was we increase TCP buffer sizes beyond that. Additionally, note that our testing is not rigerous, we performed a single test at each TCP memory increments and do not control for external factors such as network fluctuations or peak time load at the datacenter. Regardless, the limited testing methodology is still sufficient to show the clear trend of increasing throughput with TCP buffer sizes.</p>
<p>While unbounding the maximum buffer sizes is probably not ideal for most configurations, we suggest increasing buffer sizes to allow for 64-128MB per TCP stream on systems where the memory is available.</p>

<p>BitChute has banned the Nordic Resistance Movement’s <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/nmr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official channel</a>, the NRM radio channel and has deleted a large number of videos uploaded by other users featuring the Resistance Movement in what appears to be a mass wave of censorship.</p>
<p>The “free speech” video site replaced the Nordic Resistance Movement’s account with the following message on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your channel has been blocked for breaching the BitChute Community Guidelines.</p>
<p>An email was sent to your registered email address detailing the reasoning behind this decision.</p>
<p>If you have not received it, or wish to appeal against the decision, then please&nbsp;contact us.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, despite this claim, no emails have been received to our registered email address from BitChute. In addition, no warnings or notifications about our videos were received by the Resistance Movement from BitChute prior to the ban.</p>
<p>This is not the first instance of BitChute censoring legitimate content on its site. Recently, BitChute blocked a number of popular channels in various countries, forcing users to use a VPN in order to view them. The censorship followed BitChute’s <a href="https://support.bitchute.com/announcements/response-to-hope-not-hate-report-on-bitchute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> in July in which they “encouraged organizations like Hope Not Hate” (a UK-based “anti-racist” organisation) to “help them improve their processes”.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the humble ASX is actually pretty damn big – as of December 4th, it has a market cap of $2,466,617,359,800. If you find that number to be a little difficult to parse, try writing it in text: <em>two-trillion-four-hundred-and-sixty-six-billion-six-hundred-and-seventeen-million-three-hundred-and-fifty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-dollars. </em></p>



<p>Below is a bubble chart showing all 2193 companies currently listed on the ASX sized in proportion to their market cap. You can hover over individual bubbles to see the full name of the company and its market cap. </p>







<p>As the bubble chart indicates, the vast bulk of the ASX is made up of just a handful of companies. In fact, the top 27 companies, a mere 1.2% of the ~2200 listed, account for over 50% of the total market cap:</p>







<p>The ASX 300, or 300 biggest companies by market cap, accounts for over 91% of the total, which is what popular index funds like VAS track; rather than buying shares in all 2193 companies, they just buy the biggest few hundred because the vast majority of publicly listed companies are such ‘small fish’. Small fish of course being a relative term – a company needs to be worth close to a billion dollars to make it into the ASX 300.</p>



<p>For example, The Reject Shop (TRS) with its 350 stores and nearly 6000 employees has a market cap of a mere $273 million, putting it in 557th place, not even on the radar of a typical index fund, and completely dwarfed by the current top dog, CBA: </p>







<p>Sadly the label won’t actually fit on The Reject Shop’s circle above because of its relative size to The Commonwealth Bank. </p>



<p>But don’t let that go to your head, CBA holders. You’re a big fish in a small pond, but you’re a tiny fish in a big pond. Plankton, really. Here’s the ASX next to Apple, the world’s largest publicly traded company:</p>







<p>Yes, you’re seeing that right – Apple is about 20% larger than the combined market cap of every Australian company put together. Here’s how things look when we add in 7 more of the world’s largest companies:</p>







<p>All of Australia’s public companies put together are roughly equivalent to a Microsoft or an Amazon, but significantly smaller than both Apple and Saudi Arabia’s ARAMCO. </p>



<p>Finally, here’s how the ASX looks next to some other exchanges.</p>







<p>As the visualisation shows, the ASX’s total 2.4T market cap pales into insignificance compared to the 38T and 17.4T market caps of the NYSE and Nasdaq. </p>



<p>According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the collective market capitalisation of the world’s stock exchanges is around 95 trillion US dollars, meaning the entire ASX represents well under 2% of the planet’s publicly listed companies.</p>

December 13, 2020 | https://mkremins.github.io/blabrecs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mkremins.github.io/blabrecs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>

December 13, 2020 | https://thesephist.com/posts/text/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>There’s a resurgence in products using text as the primary user interface.</p>
<p>The most popular tool that uses text as a core UI is probably Microsoft Excel. Excel is a mostly-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> application, but when interacting with formulas and programming cells, the interface of choice for most users is text – typing in formulas as textual information, not clicking buttons. When we want to take the sum over a row, most of us click on the cell and type <code>=SUM(A3:A10)</code> – we don’t click on a “sum” button or unfurl a dropdown menu.</p>
<p>The poster child of textual user interfaces is the command line in the terminal. But I think a new crop of tools, combined with a more tech-savvy market, is staging the rebirth of text as a user interface. Textual interfaces are everywhere in the modern workplace. Slash-commands in Slack and Discord and Notion, hash-tags for channels and tagging, special syntax for searching and querying data across applications, @-mentions in social media and team work environments, and so on. We’re training ourselves to be more savvy users of the <em>textual interface</em>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/text-interface.jpg" alt="Text as an interface">
</p>
<h2 id="the-forces-at-work">The forces at work</h2>
<p>I think we’re seeing textual interfaces rise in popularity wherever people look for any of the following.</p>
<h3 id="progressive-feature-discovery">Progressive feature discovery</h3>
<p>Text interfaces within graphical UIs gained popularity in places with a high feature-to-visual-complexity budget. In other words, when there’s many more features than can fit comfortably on the screen at once, we hide that surplus complexity behind text options.</p>
<p>In many tools with a high degree of hidden complexity, the average user uses only a small subset of those features frequently. A Slack workspace, for example, might have a hundred slash-commands enabled, but each individual team member may only frequently use 5-10 of those commands on a regular basis. Rather than clutter up the interface with a hundred buttons or a web of dropdown menus, we hide the complexity behind text options, and the user can learn the few features they use most frequently, so they can access them again easily.</p>
<p>This idea applies to tools with a lot of complexity, where any single user might only take advantage of a small subset of that feature set. I think more tools are falling into this bucket as productivity tools consolidate. If a single kind of interface is shared by all business-chat clients, or all product-management tools, or version control software – rather than building custom interfaces for each workflow or use case, why not provide a wide surface area of functionality that’s accessible via text?</p>
<h3 id="extensibility-and-the-portable-interface">Extensibility and the portable interface</h3>
<p>Modern software workflows cross application and service boundaries all the time. Textual interfaces provide an enforceable, rigorous contract between services and applications that can act as the interfaces for apps to integrate with external services, in a way that visual interfaces can’t.</p>
<p>In a software development team, a proposal for a bug fix might flow through a task tracker, which connects with a team messaging app, where an engineer might run a group poll or lead a discussion. The request change might flow back into the task tracker, into a version control system like GitHub, and then deploy automatically to production servers.</p>
<p>Workflows like this require that apps from completely different vendors and domains are able to communicate with each other. More importantly, it requires that the interfaces we use to control these tools be <em>portable</em>. A portable interface carries the same kind of UI across different services, so the user can interact with any service similarly across all of its integrations. Portability means that we can enter data into our task tracker through our chat client, or request the rollout of a change through an infrastructure provider from our version control system.</p>
<p>These integration points are much easier to build, and easier to master as end users, when they all share the same, portable format – text.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Textual interfaces make automation trivial, and automation tools much easier to build.</p>
<p>More people are using tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://runalloy.com/">Alloy</a> to automate common business tasks or link very domain-specific workflows together across services. Having a shared portable interface across these apps, and a syntax format that can serve as a contract for how to use that interface, makes it possible for these automation points to communicate to dozens of other services easily. It also minimizes the possibility that a future update to the UI might break an automated workflow.</p>
<p>Text interfaces are much easier for machines to use. And as more work is done autonomously by the workflows we teach machines to perform, text interfaces are starting to matter just as much as human ones.</p>
<h3 id="sharability">Sharability</h3>
<p>People naturally want to document their workflows to remember, share, and iterate upon as a team. To share a graphical workflow, I’d need to record my screen or spend time writing down instructions for how to navigate a visual interface, clicking the right buttons and checking the right boxes. Reifying workflows as text makes this much easier – I can just encode a workflow into a few lines of text input.</p>
<p>In this way, workflows driven by text interfaces are easier to share, document, and iterate over time within a team. Text interfaces make workflows more concrete.</p>
<h2 id="workflows-not-data-are-the-subject-of-innovation">Workflows, not data, are the subject of innovation</h2>
<p>Given these benefits of text as an interface, weighted against the very real cost – text is a more esoteric way to use a computer – why are we seeing a resurgence in this trend now?</p>
<p>I think the easiest factor we can identify is that more people entering the workforce are unafraid of textual interfaces, because they’ve been typing and messaging and tagging their friends online all their life. They already interact with computers via text.</p>
<p>But the second reason that’s driving the industry to text is that <strong>the focus of software services has shifted from manipulating <em>data</em> to manipulating <em>workflows</em>.</strong> We’ve learned how to store and sift through data in our computers as a society, so we’re moving up a step of abstraction, to storing and sharing the how’s of our work, not just the what’s.</p>
<p>Workflows, not data, are the subject of product innovation now. And the subject is easier to study, to compare, to share and extend, when it’s concrete and durable, not an organic, ephemeral series of actions.</p>
<p>I think as long as we’re innovating on <em>how</em> we work, and how the services we use can work together more effectively, text as an interface is here to stay. And why not? The software industry has spent the last half-century building tools to help us wrangle with text, and we can rediscover those tools and ideas again.</p>
<p>We’re entering a renaissance of user interfaces, not in the sense of a novel paradigm shift, but in the sense of a rediscovery of classic, enduring ideas on which we can build better tools and systems. And I, for one, welcome it.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In the decade since the 2009 Financial Crisis, I've carried with me two mental models: <strong>Mimicry and Reflexivity</strong>. They describe how perception and reality intermingle, and together they describe some of the most profound ideas on how the human world works.</p>
<p>And I've only just realized these are different sides of the <strong>same</strong> coin.</p>
<p>Most people think in terms of a 1-way causal relationship between perception and reality, comparable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Plato's Cave</a>. Reality is assumed to be <strong>superior</strong> (e.g. more real) to perception. Reality is also perceived as more <strong>objective</strong> than perception - "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts."</p>
<p>Where this model fails is in appreciating how much of reality is <em>socially constructed</em>, and <em>therefore a matter of perception</em>.</p>
<p>This explains everything from money to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367596.Manias_Panics_and_Crashes">manias</a>, from democracy to conspiracy, from fashion to religion, from SEO to product design, from hiring to performance management. I could fill a book spelling out the applications of these general ideas in various domains; but it'd make for an insufferably repetitive blogpost. Instead I'll briefly introduce these mental models and invite you to discuss what you see in the mirror.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="mimicry"><a href="#mimicry">Mimicry</a></h2>
  <p>Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry">Batesian Mimicry</a>. This is best explained by analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism">Aposematism</a> in nature, when an animal signals to predators that it is not worth eating<strong>.</strong></p>
  <p>At first, a poisonous frog evolves and its most distinctive outward feature is bright redness. Because they are incentivized to find out about poison <em>before</em> eating, predators start to associate bright redness with poison, and avoid bright red frogs.</p>
  <p>Pop question: <em>what happens next?</em></p>

    <p>Note: While you pause to actually think this through... I'll also observe that the frog is also incentivized to evolve a distinctive signal like bright redness. It is presumably better to help predators figure out you are poisonous than to require them to nibble on you first. This signal is "costly" to develop, so you also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry">Müllerian mimicry</a> occur, where this cost is shared.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Answer: <em>Other frogs turn red</em>. Including the non-poisonous ones. The stronger the signal, the stronger the mimicry. An initially "honest" signal becomes dishonest. Because signals are easier to mimic than the underlying quality, all honest signals eventually get overwhelmed by dishonest ones and lose all meaning. The poisonous frog must then find another signal. The cycle repeats.</p>

  <h2 id="reflexivity"><a href="#reflexivity">Reflexivity</a></h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)">Reflexivity</a> points out circular relationships between cause and effect. This is perhaps oxymoronic, because we are really asserting that "effect" affects "cause" so much so that they are indistinguishable.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qs28inpo3ilfzqhv2w0p.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>I understand reflexivity best in economics. In George Soros' dense classic <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369708.The_Alchemy_of_Finance">The Alchemy of Finance</a>, he observed the strange mathematics of the 1980's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger-mania.asp">merger mania</a> - profits of conglomerates were more certain and highly valued than small companies. Their high stock prices enabled them to buy out their smaller cousins and add those profits to theirs, further increasing the stock price (aka "arbitraging" valuation multiples). We understand this math to be obviously unsustainable today, but there is a genuine way in which the high expectations helped enable fundamental actions that at least partially fulfilled those expectations.</p>
  <p>In a more modern context, you could view tech hiring as reflexive. Tech company recruiters often tell a story of high and rising stock prices as part of their compensation story. In this way the valuation of a company (perception) directly influences hiring (reality).</p>
  <p>My third example is perhaps most convincing: Real estate values are reflexive. House prices are influenced by bank lending, and bank lending is determined by the banks' estimation of house prices. Real estate is thus locked in a self reinforcing cycle of boom and bust. Mostly boom, because governments are incentivized to cause boom, and people vote in governments (see a pattern here?).</p>
  <p>Wikipedia equates reflexivity to a positive feedback loop - buyers cause a rising stock price, which attracts more buyers, which causes more rising stock prices. It's fine but far too simplistic. Reflexivity is also about perception <em>legitimately and fundamentally</em> shaping reality and vice versa.</p>
  <p>My definition of reflexivity: <strong>The more you believe something to be true, <em>the more true it becomes</em>.</strong></p>
  <p>Reflexivity isn't a complete or perfect model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The endless ping-pong between cause and effect must stop somewhere, and Reflexivity is silent on <em>when</em> the loop stops (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment">Hyman Minsky</a> for that).</li>
    <li>I am also fond of pointing out <em>anti-reflexivity</em> - <em>the more you believe something to be true, the <strong>less</strong> true it is.</em> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">Efficient Market Hypothesis</a> is glaringly antireflexive - the more people believe it to be true, they passively invest in index funds and give up on looking for market mispricing - which lets mispricing occur.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However it is clearly at least partially explanatory of our reality, and therefore useful.</p>

  <h2 id="synthesis"><a href="#synthesis">Synthesis</a></h2>
  <p>For a long time (over a decade!) I have carried these two models in my head as separate models. But let's put them side by side:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reality <em>deceives</em> perception as much as it informs</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>The more you believe something to be true, <em>the more true it becomes</em>.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reflexivity builds a positive feedback loop between perception and reality, and Mimicry breaks it.</p>
  <p>This is the insight I had today.</p>

<p>Hiring a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</a> is a difficult feat at the best of times. But for startups, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/non-technical-founder-hiring-cto">a lot rides on choosing the right candidate</a>. Whereas in a large organization a CTO might be expected to focus largely on high-level strategic decisions such as overseeing development teams and finding integration partners, in the startup environment, it’s all hands on deck — from day one.</p>
<p>Your CTO might have to do everything from hop into the code to establish lead sprint meetings, and find time to <a href="https://www.cfpland.com/guides/speaking/">travel to tech conferences</a>.</p>
<p>I was recently asked to help a startup interview a prospective CTO. Here are some of the questions I used during the interview process, and I hope they help you in your CTO hiring process. I’ve ordered these by topic so that you can jump to the ones that best suit your startup’s needs.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for more reading material, I’ve assembled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for startup founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="mvp-development">MVP Development</h2>
<p>For many startups, building a minimal viable product (MVP) is the first technical job to get done as soon as the logo’s been decided upon and the startup garage has been rented. And guess what? For many startups, building it isn’t going to get outsourced to Upwork. Use these questions to gauge your potential CTO’s readiness to get the job done.</p>
<h3 id="1-tell-us-about-your-previous-experience">1. Tell Us About Your Previous Experience?</h3>
<p>You want to gauge whether your potential CTO has pulled off an MVP-development project before. Gambling on a first timer could be a risky proposition. How long did development take? What did the workflow look like? Don’t be shy about asking for the details to make sure that you’re dealing with somebody who will be comfortable taking on <em>your</em> project.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Previous MVP experience with a specific completion timeline.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> The obvious red flag is a potential CTO that has never gotten involved in the MVP creation process before and doesn’t know much about what it typically entails. Whether this will be a dealbreaker for you really depends upon your risk tolerance profile.</p>
<h3 id="2-whats-your-preferred-software-stack">2. What’s Your Preferred Software Stack?</h3>
<p>What tools is your potential CTO familiar with? If you’ve already decided upon a stack, perhaps based upon your other development resources, then you’ll want to look for somebody whose experience is congruous with your own. If your guys use Jenkins but the potential hire only knows Bamboo, this could be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody who knows the stack that you’re interested in.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> It may make life very difficult if your potential hire has never worked with the tools you want to get onboard with. Again, whether this is acceptable or now will depend upon how much risk you’re comfortable taking on.</p>
<h3 id="3-tell-me-about-a-time-you-joined-an-existing-codebase-that-was-in-bad-shape-how-did-you-get-acclimated-to-it-how-did-you-improve">3. Tell Me About A Time You Joined An Existing Codebase That Was In Bad Shape? How did you get acclimated to it? How did you improve?</h3>
<p>In Startupland, QA doesn’t always get the attention it deserves. There are sprint deadlines to meet and resources can be constrained at the best of times. Will your potential hire balk at the site of a code jungle or get to grips with it? Finding out what the potential hire <em>did</em> in order to turn around a situation that was less than ideal can also give you valuable insights about the potential hire’s problem management skills.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody who’s pulled off the process of getting to work on a codebase that was in less than ideal condition.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> If you need somebody who’s going to be comfortable diving in the deep end, then you probably don’t want a candidate that would freak out at the first sign of trouble. If that’s the case, look for somebody who has experienced getting their hands dirty with an ugly codebase.</p>
<h2 id="hiring">Hiring</h2>
<p>A startup CTO will often fulfill functions that budge into traditional HR territory. While human resource functions can be invaluable for their skills in keeping track of benefits and vacation leave, a coder is often the best-placed resource to hire another coder.</p>
<h3 id="4-tell-me-about-the-last-hire-you-made-what-was-your-process-and-who-did-you-hire-why-did-they-stand-out">4. Tell me about the last hire you made. What was your process and who did you hire? Why did they stand out?</h3>
<p>Here, you want to find out whether the potential CTO has a discerning eye for talent. The technical job market is incredibly competitive and it’s important that your potential CTO will be able to separate outstanding candidates from those who are only likely to make a mediocre contribution to your team.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Can your potential CTO provide strong reasons for why they chose to make certain hiring decisions? What did they look for in the successful candidate? Do those reasons align with the type of talent you’re looking to onboard?</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> You’re probably <em>not</em> looking to hire somebody who can’t articulate why he/she made certain hiring decisions</p>
<h3 id="5-have-you-ever-made-a-bad-hire-when-did-you-figure-it-out-what-did-you-do">5. Have you ever made a bad hire? When did you figure it out? What did you do?</h3>
<p>A bad hire can <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050876/why-resume-based-hiring-can-spell-disaster-for-startups">spell disaster for an early stage startup</a> that doesn’t have the financial resources to throw good money after bad. Here, you’re trying to assess how quickly your potential CTO remedied the situation — and whether they did at all.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that quickly spotted that there was a problem and took swift action to bring the issue to the bad hire’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Response like <em>“we were a chill company, we didn’t really care”</em> definitely don’t communicate the right attitude. You’ll want somebody that didn’t let a bad situation persist and took action.</p>
<h3 id="6-have-you-ever-had-to-let-someone-go-why">6. Have you ever had to let someone go? Why?</h3>
<p>While the above will provide you with a good sense for the potential hire’s overall managerial ability, you’ll want to dive a little deeper in order to see whether the maybe-CTO was capable of following through on the uncomfortable act of terminating somebody’s employment.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that was able to swifty do what was necessary for the company’s best interests.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Somebody that procrastinated over the job of firing somebody. There’s a chance that they might do the same if the issue crops up at your company.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>These days cybersecurity is a concern for organizations both small and large. One of the key functionalities of a startup CTO is going to be around making sure that all internal systems are properly secured. Does the potential CTO have the required background in security to know what to look for?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zaAN5H5.jpg" alt="CTO candidates should know a substantial amount about security"></p>
<h3 id="7-what-are-some-of-the-first-things-you-would-check-when-evaluating-organizational-security-at-a-startup">7. What are some of the first things you would check when evaluating organizational security at a startup?</h3>
<p>The potential CTO’s in the door. Now what. Do they have a coherent plan for how to bring a security culture to an early stage startup? (<a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/security-tips-startups">Check out this post for tips on what to implement</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that knows what to look for and is able to demonstrate a readiness for how to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Responses like “security isn’t a big focus on mine” or “it could probably wait” are likely indicative of a candidate that will be happy to put security on the backburner for as long as possible.</p>
<h3 id="8-what-are-some-common-security-issues-youve-seen-in-startup-codebases-in-the-past-what-steps-did-you-take-to-mitigate-them">8. What are some common security issues you’ve seen in startup codebases in the past? What steps did you take to mitigate them?</h3>
<p>Again, previous experience is telling. Has your potential CTO encountered common unsecure codebases in the past? And if so, what exactly did they do to take action?</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Experience securing codebases and stacks isn’t necessary, but it would certainly give a potential candidate a leg up. Somebody with experience actioning security best practices might deserve a leg up in your hiring process. A coherent approach to tackling these security issues also vouches for their project management skills.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Candidates who have never had to grapple with this issue before might not have the experience to contribute if they run into issues like this at your organization.</p>
<h3 id="9-when-do-you-not-fix-a-security-vulnerability">9. When do you not fix a security vulnerability?</h3>
<p>This is something of a trick question. Cybersecurity measures have to be <a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-early-stage-startups-can-enlist-the-right-amount-of-security-as-they-grow/">weighed against the resources of the company</a>. For instance, rolling out company-wide encryption on all devices would not be appropriate for most startups. But for organizations that have to comply with data governance standards such as HIPAA, this might be a legislative need.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that demonstrates that they would take a resource-sensitive and measured approach to implementing cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Somebody that has great security knowledge but fails to weigh up countervailing factors such as cost.</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>CTOs can become mini project managers responsible for allocating resources in the development team as carefully as the company needs them to be allocated. Ask a series of questions designed to tease out just how good they might be at this important aspect of the job.</p>
<h3 id="10-describe-for-me-an-agile-development-workflow-youve-used-in-the-past">10. Describe for me an “Agile” development workflow you’ve used in the past?</h3>
<p>If you’re a startup organization, then we reckon there’s, well, quite a high chance that you’re going to be using Agile as your formal development and project management methodology. As with most things, it’s generally advantageous if the CTO candidate can demonstrate that they have prior experience in this field so that they can hit the ground running.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that, through recounting prior experience, can demonstrate that they have good mastery over the Agile process and can walk you through a prior workflow that they successfully implemented.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> If your potential CTO has neither heard of Agile nor can tell you what a good workflow would look like, then they’re probably going to struggle in an Agile-first environment.</p>
<h3 id="11-describe-for-me-an-agile-development-workflow-youve-used-in-the-past">11. Describe for me an “Agile” development workflow you’ve used in the past?</h3>
<p>This is a great and pointed question to ask if you’d like to learn more about how your potential CTO would handle prioritization and triaging feature requests. Having a clear head about what is necessary and what isn’t is a great way to discern how good your candidate is at prioritization.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> A candidate that is able to …</p></div></article></section></div>

GitHub pages are the best way to host static blogs like <code>Gatsby</code>. One of the most common ways to do this is, maintain your code in main/master branch, build it, and then push the code to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
There are various CI that easily automate this process like Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
With GitHub actions, this would be a piece of cake, and without depending on any third-party provider. From the docs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not sure what are GitHub actions please visit <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">here</a>.</p>
<h2><center> Workflow </center></h2>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ol>
<li>You have a static blog(let’s say gatsby) setup, the code for your blog is in master branch.</li>
<li>You have a build script in your package.json</li>
<li>You have setup your GitHub pages (or pointed to your custom domain) in <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Process</h4>
<center><strong> Step 1 </strong></center><br>
Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages">gh-pages npm package</a> in your project, this is a small utility package which helps to publish your code to gh-pages branch.
You can skip this step in case you want to push all contents from master to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.  
<center><strong>Step 2 </strong></center><br>
Add a deploy script in your <code>package.json</code>. This script should do 2 jobs
<ol>
<li>Build the project, make it ready for being published.</li>
<li>Push the changes to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, this pushes the code to <code>gh-pages</code> via npm package.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>"deploy": "gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -r https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;.git"</code></pre></div>
<center><strong>Step 3 </strong></center><br>
Generate an access token and add it to secret of your repository.
<ol>
<li>Create an access token: goto <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a>, create a new token, give it access for repo and workflow.  </li>
</ol>

<li>Create a workflow file, you need to create a file in following path: <code>.github/workflows/&lt;some-name-you-like&gt;.yml</code>, its important to have <code>.yml</code> extension and have exact same path.</li>
<li>
<p>Following action file is complete enough to publish <code>gh-pages</code>, every time a new commit is merged in master branch. ✅</p>

<p>This script is pretty self-explanatory, it performs the following tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It specifies to work only on <code>push</code> on <code>master</code></li>
<li>Sets up a <code>node 12</code> environment</li>
<li>Installs dependencies via <code>npm ci</code></li>
<li>Sets up git requirements for username and email (required to do a push to branch)</li>
<li>Run the deploy script</li>
<li>In case you don’t use gh-pages npm package, you can write another step for git push to gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>At last, we set up env variable <code>GH_TOKEN</code> from our action secret (which you set up in step 3), this env variable would be available in <code>package.json</code></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

    <div itemprop="articleBody">

      <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>To make a default Vim installation more useful, type the following 5 lines into its <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hls
set ic
set is
set nu
set noswf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if you prefer, copy and paste the spelled out and annotated version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hlsearch    " highlight all search results
set ignorecase  " do case insensitive search 
set incsearch   " show incremental search results as you type
set number      " display line number
set noswapfile  " disable swap file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For what it’s worth, the acronym for the 5 lines is <code>HIINN</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410751" target="_blank">Multiple people on HN</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410742" target="_blank">have pointed out</a> that the 5 lines can be combined into a single line like below. I didn’t know about this capability, but will definitely start doing this from now on:</p>



<p>Also, as mentioned below, this is for temporary environments where you read more than you edit. For your local set up, it’s better to take the time to properly maintain the config file and install plugins as needed.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> is a powerful text editor for Unix/Linux, and I use it frequently to view and edit files. Unfortunately, Vim’s default configurations lack several important usability features compared to popular alternative text editors, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>.</p>

<p>The undesirable defaults are not an issue on my own computer, as I can take the time to configure them. However, often I’d find myself debugging or reading logs on near-fresh Linux installations (eg. virtual machines spun up to do integration testing), where Vim had not yet been configured.</p>

<p>So over time, I distilled the text editor features that I needed the most, and came up with the list above. To set it up, I would run <code>vim ~/.vimrc</code>, manually enter those 5 lines in whichever order that I remembered them, then quit and restart Vim to pick up the new configurations.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The first 4 lines are straightforward - most popular modern text editors already come with all of them out of the box. The last one could be controversial, since <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file" target="_blank">swap file</a> is designed to help users recover work. In practice though, I find it to be more in the way, due to the additional dialogue that pops up when opening a file that has an existing swap file. The recovery feature itself is also not useful to me, as I more often read logs rather than make edits in those cases.</p>

<p>The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, I recommend you to also try putting those 5 lines into the <code>.vimrc</code>. It could make your Vim experience just a bit better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently saw these two videos about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8RkArhtCc4">discrete fourier transform (DFT)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0">discovering the fast fourier transform (FFT)</a> and I got re-inspired to experiment with the FFT algorithm again.</p><p>If you’re not sure what a Fourier Transform is or you’re not sure how the DFT or FFT algorithms work, then check out the videos above.</p><p>If you’re not so keen on videos, or don’t have the time, I’ll try to briefly explain it.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-fft">What is the FFT?</h2><p>Before covering FFT, let’s first talk about what the Fourier Transform is. It takes an input from ‘signal space’ and converts it to ‘frequency space’. What does that mean? Take a look at the following graphs</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/pure.png" alt="pure sine wave and frequency"></p><p>This shows a simple sine wave, and its frequency can be seen in the spike in the frequency space graph, not so interesting yet.</p><p>However, if we were to make our signal a bit more complex, by layering 3 different sine waves on top of each other, we see that the Fourier Transform is still able to extract the unique frequencies</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/noisy.png" alt="pure sine wave and frequency"></p><p>There’s a lot more that the Fourier Transform can do, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">wikipedia article</a> to learn more.</p><p>The Fast Fourier Transform is a very efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform.</p><h3 id="wait-what-is-the-discrete-fourier-transform">Wait, what is the discrete fourier transform?</h3><p>I’ve skipped a bit about the fourier transform, but it’s defined as the following complex integral.</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/ft.svg" alt="fourier transform integral"></p><p>This is a continuous operation and impractical to work with real world data in a computer. Instead, we want a version which works on discrete data.</p><p>Instead, we can turn the integral into a finite summation</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/dft.svg" alt="discrete fourier transform"></p><p>and the same properties will apply. The issue with this formula is that it will have a complexity of <code>O(n^2)</code>. This means that the run time will quadruple as the input length doubles. This is a big deal for sound processing. Typical audio is sampled at 44,100 times per second. This would need 1,944,810,000 calculations for analysing just a second of audio.</p><p>However, because of the symmetric properties of the fourier transform, there happens to be a clever trick we can do. We can split the input, apply the DFT to each half, then combine them. We can do the same trick to these smaller signals. This takes the complexity all the way down to <code>O(n log n)</code>. This theoretically brings the calculations required for the 44100 sample signal down to ~ 680,000. That’s almost 3000 times faster.</p><p>Here’s what the FFT algorithm looks like written in python (using numpy)</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>fft</span>(xs):

    <span>return</span> output
</code></pre></div><h2 id="how-can-we-speed-this-up-some-more">How can we speed this up some more?</h2><p>As far as I am aware, there’s no way to speed up the algorithm further than <code>O(n log n)</code>, so instead, we have to use some programming optimisations.</p><p>I’m going to be writing this implementation in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Rust</a>. Don’t worry too much if you’re not familiar, I’ll explain it as we go.</p><p>The first thing which I want to optimise is the recursion. Recursion is useful and clever and provides very simple solutions to some complex problems, but it ends up being quite slow. Every time you call a function, you push more data onto ‘the stack’. The stack controls the data that you will be using regularly. This includes the input variables, any new variables you create in the function, as well as where you will return to once the function is done. This adds up quite considerably with recursive functions.</p><p>How can we possible make this non-recursive? It turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function">most simple recursive functions</a> can be written iteratively. Let’s dry run out FFT above with a small input to see what happens</p><ol><li>Let’s take the input <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</code> with <code>n = 8</code>.</li><li>First, we split input in half. We get <code>es=[0, 2, 4, 6]</code> and <code>os=[1, 3, 5, 7]</code>.</li><li>We then apply the FFT to <code>es</code>. <code>n = 4</code></li><li>We split the input in half again, <code>[0, 4]</code> and <code>[2, 6]</code> respectively.</li><li>We then apply FFT again to <code>[0, 4]</code>, now <code>n = 2</code>.</li><li>Again, we split this in half, <code>[0]</code>, <code>[4]</code>. Since these are our base cases, we can stop here.</li><li>Now that they’re split, we can combine the two outputs.</li></ol><p>Ok, let’s pause here. We split the input in half 3 times before getting down to the base case, then we combine them back up again at the end. Let’s try something different.</p><h3 id="splitting-the-input">Splitting the input</h3><p>Let’s instead try to split up the entire input before doing any combining.</p><ul><li><code>[0, 2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5, 7]</code></li><li><code>[0, 4], [2, 6], [1, 5], [3, 7]</code></li><li><code>[0], [4], [2], [6], [1], [5], [3], [7]</code></li></ul><p>We can then combine them back up just the same as before. We might notice though that we’ve not actually required any more space. We’ve just re-arranged our input. Let’s zip it up back into a single array</p><p><code>[0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7]</code></p><p>Much simpler.

<h2><a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">JUMP STRAIGHT INTO THE ILLUSTRATION APP</a></h2>

<p>Neural networks are often regarded as difficult to understand or interpret. Visualising their functionality and how they learn is challenging and has driven many research and engineering pursuits. In this blog post, we will take a step back from complex and high-dimensional domains (such as natural images). Instead, we structure a fairly simply problem that is neatly visual in order to interrogate some properties of neural networks.</p>

<p>It is typically not useful to consider the elementary components (neurons) that constitute neural networks individually. From layer to layer, it is the weighted linear aggregation of inputs and adjustments (biases) that gets fed into a non-linear activation function. This particular combination of inputs dictates how a neuron makes use of its activation function. For the purposes of this post, we will only consider the ReLU:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/relu.svg" alt="ReLU" width="100%"></p>

<p>where the non-linearity boundary is marked with the red circle. Despite being a simple function - the maximum of zero or the input - the ReLU class of non-linearities is widely used. It is usually not the activation function that allows a neural network to model complex functions, but rather the interaction between all the processing elements. In this post we will study both the complex interplay between neurons at different layers as well as single neurons themselves. We do this by inspecting the non-linearity boundary (the red circle, above) over an entire data-domain. As you can imagine, a simplified and illustrative data domain is necessary for this. A similar set-up was used <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/image_regression.html">here</a> to paint images.</p>

<h2 id="the-set-up">The set-up</h2>

<p>To visualise the interaction between a domain of data and neurons we consider as inputs pixel locations of an image. <strong>No, not an image, but rather individual (x, y) pixel locations (normalised between [0, 1] for simplicity).</strong> The predicted probability output of the neural network answers: is this pixel black or is this pixel white? We set this up as a classification task for simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="the-network">The network</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/network_diagram++.svg" alt="Network diagram" width="100%"></p>

<p>This neural network has three hidden layers, each of which have sixteen neurons. It was trained by minimising the cross-entropy loss over 1,270,000 iterations, each of which consists of a randomly selected minibatches of 128 pixel locations. We used the Adam optimiser with its default hyperparameters, and gradually reduce the learning rate to zero using cosine annealing.</p>

<p>The entire data-domain <strong>is the image on the left</strong>. Therefore, the function that this neural network is modelling <em>can be visualised and interpreted by processing all pixel locations</em> to produce something like the image on the right. Note that the above predicted visualisation is for demonstrative purposes: the network does do better than this!</p>

<h2 id="the-demonstration">The demonstration</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/ginn.html">This web application</a> demonstrates how the neurons in this network behave throughout learning. There are three ‘good’ runs that converged satisfactorily and one ‘bad’ run that failed to model the central diamond. Feel free to head over there and play around with this tool. Analysing a single neuron’s non-linear boundary throughout training gives an intuition for how these elements coalesce into powerful function approximators.</p>

<p>When selecting a neuron to visualise, what you see is the non-linear activation boundary defined by the ReLU function: when it moves from a region in data-space that triggers the activation to be on or off. Stacking these non-linear boundaries can be interpreted as inducing a more finely granulated interpretation of the data space from which to make decisions. To visualise this, take note of how the later layers can branch off earlier layers to create more complicated line intersections - this is easier to see when selecting only one neuron to visualise in the last layer and finding its contributing intersectors in the layers preceding it.</p>

<p>All too often it can be difficult to understand just what neural networks are learning, how they arrive at a converged state and solution, or where they put their ‘energy’ (i.e. decision making power, in this case). What this visualisation offers is an attempt to give an intuitive grasp as to how layers in a neural network interpret the data domain.</p>

<p>Training the neural network with different seeds generates unique demonstrations (<a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good1.html">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good2.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">3</a>, and <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/bad1.html">4</a>). There are three ‘good’ results and one failure case to choose from. After playing with the demo you might notice some intriguing phenomena. First, lets take a look at a full sweep of one of the good runs:</p>

<h3 id="all-non-linear-boundaries-for-a-training-run">All non-linear boundaries for a training run</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/sweep.gif" alt="Full sweep" width="80%"></p>

<p>The background represents the predicted probability of a white pixel. The blue lines are the first layer’s non-linear boundaries, the red lines are the second layer’s non-linear boundaries, and the green lines are the third layer’s non-linear boundaries. Notice how the blue lines can only ever be a straight line across the data space itself, while the red lines can diverge off the blue lines, and the green lines off both the red and blue lines.</p>

<h3 id="bias-shift-before-weight-shift">Bias shift before weight shift</h3>

<p>Changing the bias term for any given neuron translates into shifting a line without changing its slope, while a change of incoming weights alters the slop of a line. Visualising the early stages of learning in <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">one of the training runs</a> reveals that the bias terms are readily and quickly adjusted before weight changes play any significant role (for layer 1, here):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/bias.gif" alt="Bias versus weights" width="80%"></p>

<p>Before the <strong>pause</strong> the bias changes dominate, and <strong>thereafter</strong> the weights are adjusted to change the slope of the lines. This is also true for deeper layers (<a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">go see for yourself</a>) and even seems to happen over multiple instances during training.</p>

<h3 id="layer-dependences-at-critical-points">Layer dependences at critical points</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/dependence.gif" alt="Critical points" width="80%"></p>

<p>First, note how the latest layer (green, layer 3) can deviate off both earlier layers even though it is not connected to the earliest layer (blue, layer 1). Second, note how the critical points in the data are strongly correlated with deviation points when <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">the network</a> reaches convergence.</p>

<h3 id="copycats">Copycats</h3>

<p>Different neurons sometimes have identical jobs. This is obviously inefficient, but sometimes difficult to avoid. <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good1.html">In this case</a>, two neurons (layer 3, neurons 2 and 6) in the final layer converge to a very similar state:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/same.gif" alt="Copycats" width="80%"></p>

<h3 id="the-indecisive-neuron">The indecisive neuron</h3>

<p>Sometimes neurons converge to a state where small shifts in the loss cause large changes in their decision boundaries:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/indecisive.gif" alt="Indecisive" width="80%"></p>

<p>This was taken toward the end of <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good1.html">one of the training runs</a> (layer 3, neuron 4), where the learning rate was close to zero (since it was cosine annealed). This behaviour does not seem to change the predicted output much, nor is it obvious how knowing it occurs could be useful, but it is interesting to witness, nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="leveraging-symmetries-in-the-data">Leveraging symmetries in the data</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/symmetry.png" alt="Leveraging symmetry" width="80%"></p>

<p>When the network leverages the (obvious, to us) symmetries in the data, the output prediction becomes better: individual neurons can multitask. The above image demonstrates the difference between two converged networks. <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">The better network</a> (top row) does a better job at predicting the data and the non-linear boundaries in all layers exhibit some left-right symmetry inherent in the data. <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good2.html">The worse network</a> (bottom row) does not capture the data symmetry nearly as well.</p>

<h3 id="a-bad-run">A bad run</h3>

<p>Finally, lets take a look at a <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/bad1.html">training run</a> that resulted in a bad reconstruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/bad.gif" alt="Poor thing" width="80%"></p>

<p>It is unclear what goes wrong in this case to result in this poor reconstruction. It might be that the earlier layers do not find the natural symmetry of the data, or that the initialisation results in later layers favouring certain neurons in earlier layers, thus bounding them within regions that are not useful for modelling the central diamond shape. It is interesting, however, to compare how much better this network does at modelling the top of the bottle:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/goodvsbad.png" alt="Good versus bad" width="80%"></p>

<p>Suppose we made this network deeper and/or wider - it may be able to devote more energy to the bottle top while still adequately modelling the central diamond.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are many more hidden gems in these illustrations. I hope that this post has been both educational and inspiring. Go <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/ginn.html">play/work/explore</a>.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>San Francisco was poised to make a big improvement in its central transit system: the <a href="http://bettermarketstreetsf.org/index.html"><em>Better Market Street</em></a> plan. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Street_(San_Francisco)">Market Street</a> is one of the major transit arteries of the city, the route that people ride to commute from the Mission and the Haight to downtown.</p><p>It’s also a high-injury corridor, and the city aimed to fix that by creating a grade-separated bike lane and lots of new and improved infrastructure.</p><p><img alt="Better market plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-better-market-plan.png"></p><p>After years of community input and design, the plan was to introduce a separate lane for bikes, sidewalk improvements, separated lanes for buses, and more.

particular symbol that combines a bicycle icon with an arrow or house icon. Initially, the bicycle was <em>inside</em> the arrow, like it was in a little house, but recently it’s next to the arrow.</p><p>Sharrow symbols are painted on streets or applied with thermoplastic decals.</p><p>The purpose of a sharrow is to <em>encourage good bicyclist and driver behavior</em>. Sharrows don’t increase legal penalties for drivers or cyclists. They encourage cyclists to take the lane, but cyclists are permitted to do that anyway, on any narrow street. Sharrows are supposed to make motorists aware of cyclists. When drivers kill people in sharrows, there aren’t any additional consequences. The consequences for hitting people with cars are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html">minimal</a>.</p><p>Sharrows do constitute <a href="http://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/home/showdocument?id=3474">class III bikeways</a>, which bring with them higher penalties for illegal parking.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-denver-sharrow.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Denver sharrow" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-denver-sharrow.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicajuriga/5066431139">A sharrow in Denver, Colorado / photo by Jess J</a></figcaption><p>James Mackay invented the sharrow in 1993 in Denver, in hopes that it would legitimize bicycles on the road, encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, and reduce wrong-way cycling:</p><blockquote><p>I was hoping the shared lane marking would legitimize the presence of bicyclists, reinforce the correct direction of travel and assign lane position, including the correct approach to an intersection and fill an intermediate niche where typical bike lane markings might not necessarily fit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But I was hoping it overall would provide a step in the right direction towards legitimizing the presence of bicycling and reinforcing bicycle usage. - <a href="https://www.thebicyclestory.com/2016/03/episode-4-a-brief-history-of-the-american-sharrow/">The Bicycle Story: James Mackay</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="what-are-sharrows-supposed-to-do">What are sharrows supposed to do?</h2><p>This is a really important question, because the answer isn’t simply “to protect people.” San Francisco and many other cities have versions of Vision Zero, the idea that traffic deaths should be reduced to zero.</p><p>Sharrows aren’t a general-purpose tool: their applicability and goal is quite specific.</p><p><a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part9/part9c.htm">According to the MUTCD</a>, sharrows may be used to:</p><ol><li>Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in a shared lane with on-street parallel parking in order to reduce the chance of a bicyclist’s impacting the open door of a parked vehicle.</li><li>Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in lanes that are too narrow for a motor vehicle and a bicycle to travel side by side within the same traffic lane.</li><li>Alert road users of the lateral location bicylists are likely to occupy within the traveled way.</li><li>Encourage safe passing of bicyclists by motorists, and</li><li>Reduce the incidence of wrong-way bicycling.</li></ol><p>The purpose of sharrows is thus pretty tied to the problem of <em>dooring</em>, in which drivers don’t look out of their rear-view window before swinging open their doors. Behavioral solutions to dooring, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooring#Dutch_Reach">Dutch Reach</a>, haven’t caught on in America because it’s America.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-a-sharrow-in-oakland-california.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="A sharrow in Oakland, California" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-a-sharrow-in-oakland-california.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4920881091">A sharrow in Oakland, California / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><p>The <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Shared-Lane-Markings-When-and-Where-to-Use-Them.pdf">SFMTA</a> proposed additional use-cases for sharrows: Hills, Narrow Streets, Discontinued Bike Lane due to Roadway Narrowing, Discontinued Bike Lane for Right Turn Lane, Lane Drop for Right Turn Only Lane, Double Turn Lanes, Double Turn Lanes with Bike Box, Route Finding, Roundabouts or Traffic Circles, Along Separated Bikeways, and Space for Only One Bike Lane.</p><p>None of this describes the Market Street plan, which would be a double-sharrow in a scenario with no on-street parking.

Let’s look at the <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/San-Franciscos-Shared-Lane-Pavement-Markings-Improving-Bicycle-Safety.pdf">San Francisco Shared Lane Marking Study</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The majority of the drivers surveyed claimed not to notice the markings. Since the sample size of drivers was so small, the results do not provide conclusive findings. -p13</p></blockquote><p>Do drivers understand the markings?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists that responded, two out of the seven that noticed the markings understood that the marking indicate that they should allow more room for cyclists. p14</p></blockquote><p>There’s a study from Brookline, MA. Do drivers notice markings there?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists surveyed, only 21% noticed the markings and were at least 70% confident that the markings indicated a preferred zone for bicycling.</p></blockquote><p>Casual observations from Warren Vermont:</p><blockquote><p>Casual verbal survey of approximately 200 local citizens and 50 bicyclists led to conclusion that bicyclists felt the symbols were too small to be effective and local drivers rarely noticed them. The Vermont DOT decided to not encourage their use, to not replace them, and to not include them in future plans</p></blockquote><p>Do cyclists understand the symbols? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp1gN8xsz3o">Here’s a news report about how they don’t</a>. The city of Fremont had to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qg6cpG7Zeg">publish a video about how to use sharrows</a>.</p><h3 id="do-sharrows-make-streets-safer">Do sharrows make streets safer?</h3><p>A striking commonality in the sharrow research is that safety is not clearly measured. Proxies to safety are measured: cyclists riding in the center of the lane, in the right direction, not on sidewalks, and sometimes the distance from cars to bikes. The Texas study does an impressive amount of statistical reasoning about passing events &amp; horizontal positioning on the street. But actual safety is not rigorously measured.</p><p>The one study that directly studies the effectiveness of bicycle sharrows <em>for safety</em> is called <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1393928"><em>The Relative (In)Effectiveness of Bicycle Sharrows on Safety Outcomes</em></a>. It’s a quick read, but the killer line is:</p><blockquote><p>Results suggest that not only are sharrows not as safe as bike lanes, but they could be more dangerous than doing nothing at all.</p></blockquote><p>This probably isn’t the question you care about, right? Proper horizontal positioning isn’t one of the <a href="https://www.visionzerosf.org/">Vision Zero SF</a> goals. Bicyclists don’t talk that much about proper horizontal positioning.</p><p>But nevertheless: proper horizontal positioning is one of the key goals of sharrows. Three of the five goals outlined in the MUTCD are different kinds of proper horizontal positioning. The first goal of San Francisco’s study was horizontal positioning. Most of the sharrow-related data collected is about horizontal positioning.</p><p>As Ferenchak &amp; Marshall note, there is mixed evidence for horizontal positioning in correctly-painted sharrows.</p><p>Amusingly, though, there are a lot of sharrows that don’t even encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, because they’re painted in the “door zone”: exactly the area that cyclists are supposed to stay away from.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Door-zone sharrow in Chicago" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/38067633996">A sharrow in Chicago that has been painted exactly in the 'door zone' which sharrows are supposed to keep bicycles out of / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><h2 id="why-dont-sharrows-go-away">Why don’t sharrows go away?</h2><p>I’m not the first to point out the uselessness of sharrows. The In(effectiveness) study by Ferenchak and Marshall got airtime on <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/14/study-sharrows-dont-make-streets-safer-for-cycling/">Streetsblog</a> and <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/sharrows-shared-lane-markings-street-cyslists-may-hurt-help/">99 Percent Invisible</a>. The bicycle coalition immediately <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">opposed San Francisco’s new sharrows</a>.

This is sort of like justifying the addition of some homeopathics in your ambulance medical kit. Sure, you have it now, but it’s not going to do anything.</p><h2 id="how-sharrows-snuck-into-transportation-planning">How sharrows snuck into transportation planning</h2><p>Sharrows started as a brutal compromise. The creator of the sharrow, James Mackay, essentially said that it was a bare-minimum way to do <em>something</em> for cycling in a city that didn’t want to do anything:</p><blockquote><p>Part of it was the city of Denver’s reluctance to do much of anything for bicycles. So I figured, this would be a less expensive approach versus the conventional bike lane markings. A lot of the agencies don’t want to do anything involving change or spending money for bicycles. I was always under pressure to do less as the Denver bicycle planner.</p></blockquote><p>In this form, as a temporary measure in the evolution of cities away from cars, sharrows made sense.</p><p>And sharrows <em>are</em> successful, to some degree, at encouraging cyclists to avoid the “door zone.” And those small, measurable improvements in ‘horizontal positioning’ bought the sharrow’s way into transit device standards.</p><p>Then cities started pushed sharrows in all sorts of scenarios that needed bike lanes, not a temporary, toothless symbol on the asphalt. And since they’re cheap and don’t disrupt car traffic, they caught on.</p><p>But sharrows have overreached and underperformed. Any …</p></div></div>

    <section>
        <p><img src="https://aberba.com/images/2020-why-use-d.png" alt="No one"></p>

<p>There are so many programming language but only a few really appeal to the
majority of developers, hence their popularity (most used) and community size
explosion. Popular languages have more hands on deck hence their
<a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/accumulative-advantage/">Accumulative Advantage</a>:
more developers -&gt; more ideas -&gt; more contributions -&gt; more tools -&gt; more
third-party packages -&gt; more corporate support (because most of these developers
work for companies) -&gt; more apps -&gt; repeat. This very advantage gives birth to
many more advancement to the language and it’s ecosystem. As more and more
people build their businesses and tools around the language, they are
incentivize to continuously invest their engineering resources and money to
improve the overall ecosystem. Think about it 🤔</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s my point in relation to D?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> is a unique but still familiar language. It has almost
all the attributes suited for a mainstream programming languages. It’s
statically typed but still manages to be fluid and easy to write code in like
any dynamically typed language. It’s got all the powerful features I’ve seen in
any other language out there, either comparably similar or better. Moreover,
it’s got some of the most brilliant people behind it. This is why I’ve gone as
far to write several articles about why D is great for development including
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/d-open-source-software-development">this one on OpenSource.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why isn’t D mainstream?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So first of all you may ask, why is it even necessary to be mainstream or
“popular”? Isn’t staying small and nimble how we can attract quality over
quantity?</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment to an extent but the cost definitely outweighs the
benefit. When a larger community is well managed with clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals, they can accomplish more. <strong>Clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals</strong> ahh? Yep. That’s one of the key missing
ingredients of the D community even as small and nimble as it is. Despite the
clever language design and seemingly promising direction, D lacks in the soft
side. This is what I believe holds the grow and adoption of the language back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft skills… the people and organizational things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a-train-with-no-destination">A train with no destination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The roadmap of the D language is still very unclear and the project page on
GitHub has not been updated for over a year. See
https://github.com/dlang/dmd/projects</li>
  <li>There’s little to no communication of language objects and mobilization of
the community to reach certain milestones. There’s almost no organizational
side to the
<a href="https://dlang.org/foundation/about.html">D Language Foundation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why do I still use D?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>D is technically the best out there for me. It’s the only modern system
programming language with a clean and familiar syntax.</li>
  <li>It’s very powerful and capable of solving any domain problem: web
development, network applications, system development, scripting, gaming,
etc. This is rare because almost every language out there is either suited
for one thing or the other.</li>
  <li>It’s got a package system. Unless you’ve got infinite amount of time on a
project, you’ll need to use code others have written to solve similar
problems you may have. D makes it easy to discover such packages from
<a href="https://code.dlang.org/">it’s package repository</a>. Almost all modern
language have similar centralized package repositories.</li>
  <li>A great community. D has got one of the best communities I’ve ever seen. The
community is very welcoming and helpful. The only thing we lack now is
mobilization and direction.</li>
  <li>It keeps getting better. D has consistently improved over the years that
I’ve been in the community. Yes, it moves at a slow pace but it doesn’t
invalidate the fact that things keep getting better.</li>
  <li>It can be better. Comparatively, D heavily lacks in community organization,
leadership communication, development tools, third-party packages,
user-friendly documentation, learning resources, onboarding experience and
general ecosystem polish. These can make D unappealing for certain projects
with the need for a matured ecosystem. However, this can be made better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this year comes to an end, I hope the D Language Foundation and community
revisit past mistakes and look for way to make things better. I am here to stay.</p>

    <p>Since 2014 when <a href="https://subreply.com/">Subreply</a> was launched as Sublevel, I always wanted for users to specify their location. After years of programming in Python I found a way to validate <strong>City, Country</strong> and <strong>Country</strong> formats in a simple and intuitive way.</p>

<h4 id="the-code">The code</h4>

<p>The first part of the problem is to have all data available so you can match the user input with the expected output. I do this by fetching world cities from Simplemaps as a hashmap or Python dictionary. There are some corrections applied to city and country names. I wanted a Django management command so I can run it every time Simplemaps update their public dataset.</p>

Full code and data can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/omarmhaimdat/blur_faces" rel="noopener">GitHub page</a>. Let’s get started.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><ul><li id="282c"><strong>On-device: </strong>The most powerful argument for on-device solutions is the latency—the whole process is performed on the phone and doesn’t necessitate communication with an external/remote API. There is also the argument of <strong>privacy.</strong> Since everything happens on-device, there is no data transferred from the phone to a remote server. A cloud-based API can be risky in terms of an entity being in the middle of the communication, or the service provided being able to literally store images for other reasons than the advertised intent.</li><li id="2298"><strong>Built-in: </strong>They are many ways to use/create on-device models that can be, in some cases, better than Apple’s built-in solution. Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection/ios" rel="noopener">ML Kit</a> provides an on-device solution on iOS for Face Detection (in my experience, similar to Apple’s in terms of accuracy), which is free and has more features than Apple’s solution. But for our use case, we just need to detect faces and draw bounding boxes. You can also build your own <a rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/face-recognition-and-detection-on-ios-using-native-swift-code-core-ml-and-arkit-feed10c468da?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">model using Turi Create’s object detection API</a> or any other framework of your choice. Either way, you still need a huge amount of diverse and annotated data to come even close to Apple’s or Google’s accuracy and performance.</li></ul><p id="84d8">Apple has been active in providing iOS developers with powerful <a rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/whats-new-in-the-vision-framework-in-ios-14-73d22a942ba5">APIs centered on computer vision</a> and even other AI disciplines (i.e. <a rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/processing-tweets-on-ios-using-natural-language-and-create-ml-8a4390868ddb">NLP</a>). They have continuously improved them by trying to represent the complex spectrum of use cases,<strong> from gender differences to racial diversity</strong>. I remember the first version of the Face Detection API being very bad at detecting darker skinned faces. They have since improved it, but there is <strong>no perfect system</strong> so far, and detection is <strong>not</strong> 100% accurate.</p></div></div></section><section></section><section><div><div><p id="a902">To get us started, we first need to create a helper class that handles multiple use cases for face detection. This helper class could be reused in any project that is using Apple’s built-in API for the same. My approach with this class is to create a series of static functions capable of returning specific values for different scenarios.</p><p id="472f">I started by creating an enum <code>Faces</code> variable that would be helpful to store whether there are no faces, one face, or multiple faces. This could become handy when you perform different actions depending on the number of faces in an image.</p><figure><div></div></figure><h2 id="3f20">AppleFaceDetection Class</h2><p id="3e8c">This will be our main class for everything related to Apple’s Face Detection Vision API. The class contains three static functions:</p><ul><li id="d8f3"><code><strong>GetNumberOfFaces</strong></code>: Function that calculates the number of faces in a given image.</li></ul><figure><div></div></figure><ul><li id="e2d8"><code><strong>GetTheFaces</strong></code>: Function that returns a <code>Faces</code> object</li></ul><figure><div></div></figure><ul><li id="10d2"><code><strong>GetFaceBoundingBoxes</strong></code>: Function that returns an array of <code>VNFaceObservation</code> objects. This object contains various information, such as confidence, landmarks, or the bounding box. This is the main function used in this project to blur faces.</li></ul><figure><div></div></figure></div></div></section><section></section><section><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png" width="3264" height="726" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1080w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2700/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1350w, https://miro.medium.com/max/3240/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1620w, https://miro.medium.com/max/3780/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1890w, https://miro.medium.com/max/4320/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 2160w, https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 2400w" sizes="100vw" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Figure 2: Create a new Single View Application</figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p id="af1a">Now we have the ML side of our project ready to go.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-view-of-the-keyboard-on-my-table.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="View of the keyboard on my table" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-view-of-the-keyboard-on-my-table.jpg"></picture></p><p>Nobody needs this keyboard. If you want to type, all you need is a laptop. The <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K2</a>, <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k380-multi-device.920-007558.html">Logitech K380</a>, or Apple Magic Keyboard will work if you keep your laptop closed.</p><p><a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus">The Atreus</a> is a keyboard for experimentation and fun. It sits in the intersection of four trends:</p><ul><li><strong>Columnar</strong>: the keys are in straight rows, not staggered.</li><li><strong>Minimal</strong>: no number keys, arrow keys, or symbol keys.</li><li><strong>Ergonomic</strong>: the layout is split into two angled halves with a gap in the middle.</li><li><strong>Mechanical</strong>: the keys are louder and move further than modern laptop keyboards.</li></ul><p>The Atreus started as a <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">handmade kit</a> designed by <a href="https://technomancy.us/colophon">Phil Hagelberg</a>. This version of it is produced by <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/pages/about">Keyboardio</a>, a pair of engineers who redesigned the Atreus into something that could be produced at scale and with mass-market level fit &amp; finish.</p><p>I’ve been using the Atreus part-time for the last few months, and it’s just what I hoped for. The learning curve is steep but achievable. My hands feel pretty good when I use it. I think it’s more ergonomic than my usual keyboard. Plus it’s simply cool and fun to use.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-showing-how-flat-the-keyboard-is.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="showing how flat the keyboard is" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-showing-how-flat-the-keyboard-is.jpg"></picture></p><p>As a novelty device, it’s important that the Atreus feels solid. And it does, even though it’s very small. It’s heavy enough, with no wobbles or gaps in construction. With weight as a sort of metric, I can see keyboards gaming it. My Keychron has an aluminum case that adds to the weight, but there are visible gaps and mismatches in its manufacturing.</p><h3 id="the-learning-curve">The learning curve</h3><p>Like other tiny keyboards, there’s a big learning curve for the Atreus. There are basically three big things to learn:</p><ol><li>There are way fewer keys, so you have to press the “Fun” key to access things like numbers and symbols.</li><li>With the split, letters like T, G, B, Y, H, and N belong to your left or right hand and you can’t “cross.” So if you previously typed “B” with your right hand, you’ll have to retrain yourself to type it with your left.</li><li>With the compact layout, there are no extra-bit keys like the space bar or tab key on a traditional keyboard.</li></ol><p><img alt="legend" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-legend.png"></p><p>The biggest challenge for me is #2: it’s hard to remember which hand types which keys. That’s also the biggest problem with switching back to traditional layouts: I’ll stretch to type “B” with my left hand because that works on the Atreus, but it doesn’t make that much sense on a traditional keyboard.</p><p>I owned a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou/description">Keyboardio Model 01</a> before, and though I was never able to adjust to its layout, the changes that it required to my typing were positive even for traditional keyboards. These isolinear keyboards make it harder to do suboptimal bad habits like typing the letter ‘p’ with your ring finger instead of your pinky - and once you learn to switch, it feels better overall.</p><p>Then there are the layers. Memorizing layers is a challenge, but the accessibility of special keys isn’t that different from a standard keyboard. Instead of typing Shift-1 to get a ! symbol, you type Super-Q. The additional layer of keys is a pain to get to and navigate out of, but it isn’t necessary for any <em>input</em> keys, only for keys like play/pause media controls.</p><p>Where this kind of keyboard tends to succeed or fail is the design of its “thumb cluster”. Whereas a traditional keyboard has a huge space bar which is the main key you hit with your thumbs, these tiny keyboards have tiny space bars and expect you to do a lot more with your thumbs. I struggled to make the thumb cluster on the Keyboardio Model 01 work, but the one on the Atreus is really convenient - there’s only one row of keys for your thumbs and they’re tightly packed in with the rest of the keys.</p><h3 id="the-keys">The keys</h3><p>I followed the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus">Kickstarter campaign</a> for this keyboard, like I did for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou/description">Model 01</a>, so I read all about some of their challenges producing these things. Hardware is hard. They tried lots of different processes to produce durable keys for this keyboard and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus/posts/2909332">etching symbols instead of printing them</a>.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-etched-keys-on-the-atreus.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="etched keys on the Atreus" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-etched-keys-on-the-atreus.jpg"></picture></p><p>This decision turned out really well. The keys look cool, are super durable, and you feel the legends just a bit. The keys are opaque and this keyboard isn’t backlit, which works out perfectly fine: when I find myself working in the dark, I should usually stop working.</p><hr><p>Anyway, nobody needs this thing, but it’s a lot of fun and it’s a really nice object. There’s a significant learning curve, but that’s part of the appeal for some of us: learning new and maybe-better ways to type gives us the same feeling as learning to ride a bike. Learning to ride a fixed-gear bike can let you relive that experience (but it’s ridiculous and niche), and learning how to type on a tiny keyboard can too, with the same caveats.</p><p>I think the Atreus is ideally positioned as a fun alternative keyboard. It’s different from a normal keyboard, but not so different that the learning curve is brutal, it’s small enough to fit on your desk as you cycle between it and a traditional keyboard, and it’s less expensive than a Kinesis Advantage, Ergodox, or Moonlander.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Have you ever worked with classes that are thousands of lines long? Those classes end up encapsulating tens of related functionality, and you end up repeating that class’ name many times, like in the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>

</ul>

<h2 id="inspiration-for-this-article">Inspiration for This Article</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this article comes from my recent mass cleanup of our test framework at the office. Like many other complex system developers, we have our custom test framework to do all sorts of automated end-to-end testing, simulating real user interactions with our apps on real devices. I can’t show the code, but it has been neglected for several years now. While modernizing it, I also decided to refactor it to use chainable methods, just as you would expect from modern test frameworks. The resulting code was exceptionally clean and developer-friendly, and it was well worth the time investment. Before diving into specifics, let me summarize what method chaining is for you.</p>

<h2 id="method-chaining">Method Chaining</h2>
<p>Method chaining is an idiom in object-oriented languages where an object’s methods return a reference to the object itself. This way, method calls can be chained together, without requiring variables to store the intermediate method call results.</p>

<p>Imagine a database object. To be able to use it for the first time on an empty database, you first need to connect to your database then initialize it. In code, it would be like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not too bad. You only have to reference the database object twice. But imagine if you could chain these calls:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>).</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much nicer isn’t it. And it will become much better in situations where it saves you 5-6 object references. If you like, you can put each method call on a new line so it will be easier to use debug-points. Here is an example using Python syntax:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I find method chaining to be an excellent utility for classes with lots of small and relevant functionality. Objects encapsulating database queries, test code, and UI code are great examples of this. Now let’s go ahead and investigate the implementation of our database class from the previous example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>DB</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In its current shape, you cannot chain the methods in this class. It is an easy fix, though. All we have to do is to finish each method with a “return self” statement so each method will return a reference to the object itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>DB</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>):</span>
        <span># todo
</span>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span># todo
</span>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span># todo
</span>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can safely chain the methods in our database class. As you might have realized, any function that needs to return something other than the object itself won’t be chainable.</p>

<p>Method chaining can also be used to build a fluent interface or implement the builder pattern, which allows you to craft large objects or even SQL queries through a chain of methods. If you want to read more on the subject, I have links to several Wiki articles for them in the resources section above. Now let’s analyze the benefits and drawbacks of method chains.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-and-drawbacks">Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
<p>The benefit of method chaining is obvious; cleaner and concise code. You don’t have to keep repeating calls to same objects for consecutive operations on the same object, which is especially useful in repetitive code like test code. You also don’t need to create temporary variables to store results from previous method calls. However, this will make it difficult to put debug points on the right method in the chain. To get around this limitation, you can separate each method call with a new line, or add a chainable <code>breakpoint()</code> method, or just put debug point on the whole statement and do step-in/step-out. Some programming language debuggers already support adding debug points on methods in the chain directly.</p>

<p>One interesting side effect of method chaining is that it will make logging harder. You normally put logging code in between method calls like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'Initializing the database.'</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you switch to method chaining, you might add a simple chainable log method to your class to work around the problem:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>log_info</span><span>(</span><span>'Initializing the database.'</span><span>)</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, method chaining is not a silver bullet, but for where it fits, it brings conciseness and clarity, which I always like. In my experience, tests and data filtering and manipulation code are prime candidates for method chaining. Next time you are going to implement a framework or a utility class, you can provide chainable methods to make life easier for the prospective users of that code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>readers</span>
  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>p</span><span>.</span><span>folowed_me_on_twitter</span> <span>===</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>p</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>pat_on_the_back</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have checked out the video in the resources section, I have used various code animations for it this time. I will produce a separate article on how I make my code animations. If you don’t want to miss it, follow me on my socials.</p>

It's so elitist.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I have an internal dialogue going all the time trying to convince myself that I don't want my work to be called science. What I do is completely different, more sacred, honest and open and yes sometimes flawed. Sometimes I hide the fact that I have a Ph.D. because I don’t want it to be a symbol of authority or intelligence for myself. It also feels douchey to tell people I have a Ph.D. I want to be judged by my actions, not where I went to school, which can be primarily determined by your parents financial status and education level. I grew up on a farm in rural Indiana. We ate eggs from our chickens and drank dehydrated milk. Up until even high school my family was dirt poor. We had our electricity shut-off and had to take cold showers. When we couldn't afford the phone bill, I walked to 7-11 and used the payphone to call my friends. Violence, evictions, car repossessions — you name it, I’ve lived it. Starting undergrad at SIU I was homeless and lived out of my car and slept on the dorm room floors of people I knew.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was in graduate school, 99% of my peers did not come from a similar background. It was abundantly clear that the practice of science and medicine is only accessible to the upper crust. That’s an issue in itself, but the <b><i>f</i></b><i><b>ucking humongous gigantic bigger problem</b></i> is that cutting-edge medicines are also only available to the societal elite. Time and time again throughout this pandemic, we’ve watched as the wealthy and powerful get all the unapproved drugs to treat their covid, while all of us peasants sit back and do our best not to die without them. The 108 Regeneron antibody cocktails all went to Washington DC.</p><p>That’s why I left academia. Why I quit my job at NASA and started doing science as a biohacker. I want everyone to be able to do science without any gatekeepers. The single greatest impediment to diversity in science is access to knowledge and information that is being held tighter than Ric Flair’s Figure Four Leg Lock.</p><p><b><span>Biohackers are setting knowledge free.</span></b></p><p>In May 2020, an article came out in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/806">science magazine</a> where researchers showed that by using a DNA vaccine that codes for the SARS-COV2 spike protein, they could create antibodies that provide protection from covid-19 in macaque monkeys without harmful side-effects. Getting good monkey data is basically the best pre-human data you can ever hope to get. Most people only have experimental data from mouse tests. When I see a paper like this the gears in my brain begin to spin because there is a good chance the FDA would approve this for human testing.</p><p>So, I decided to test it myself. The project perfectly fit a niche where biohackers have an experimental advantage over academia and industry. With enough knowledge and skill, we could perform quick but data-laden experiments to show whether the same DNA vaccine tested on monkeys would be promising in humans. And instead of taking months or years we could have results in as little as a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>I brought up the idea with David Ishee and Dariia Dantseva, fellow members of the biohacking group the <a href="http://the-cdc.com/" target="_blank">Central Dogma Collective (CDC)</a>. They also thought that based on the data this would be a fucking crazy project. We decided <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNAhY1w2w78rSeNQo_e0dQ2w8mmGEg7Mr">we would live-stream</a> every step so that people could learn how to do advanced biomedical research like this in their own home. If one were to replicate the experiment from scratch, the total individual cost would end up being around $3500, the major costs being $1600 for DNA synthesis and $1200 for the kits to measure coronavirus spike protein antibodies.</p><p>What I really wanted was to show people how to do the science. I didn't really care if it worked or not but I tend to be pessimistic about my own experiments anyway. While testing and creating a successful coronavirus vaccine would send a powerful message to the world, teaching people how to do advanced biomedical research will change it.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the experiment worked. All three of us developed SARS-CoV2 spike protein neutralizing antibodies. I still can't fucking believe it. Not only did we create and test a successful vaccine, we showed that we could get a gene therapy to work (a DNA vaccine changes the DNA in your cells and so is a gene therapy also). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTuRBuy74KlaBzLrd0aTZl852nhPNCWL06aB7wY1JKk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a summary of the experimental details and results</a> if you are interested. We didn't create the vaccine to sell it. We made the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SracILuRbiZt4f7EVH2JBvefaHmsOUsC?usp=sharing" target="_blank">nucleotide sequence and genetic design data open and free</a> so that anyone can easily recreate it. All in a state-of-the-art lab. I'm kidding, my lab is a tiny bedroom in a house in West Oakland, David's is in a shed in rural Mississippi and Dariia's is an old building she converted in Ukraine. If your mind isn't blown, you either already knew about the project or you don't understand what I just told you.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span>If you want to know why I created and tested a coronavirus vaccine on myself, it’s because I am at War.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I know it sounds a bit dramatic but there really is a class war going on. There is a group of people who are actively making choices that cause a disproportionate amount of deaths among those in lower social classes. New gene therapies cost over a million dollars. That’s right. Your life, your child’s life, your mother, your loved one depends on how much money you make. The government and Pharma companies aren’t going to help you when you can’t afford it either. Most of these gene therapies aren't even available outside the US either because most countries with socialized medicine won't pay for them. So don't tell me how your country's healthcare is better.</p><p>Considering that if you are reading this there is a 99% chance you are not part of the top 1%, let me ask you this — why are we letting the wealthy and powerful get away with this?&nbsp;</p><p>Those who have a monopoly on the understanding and use of biotechnology have all the power. If I, if we can teach people how do it themselves then we win back power.</p><p>This is why biohackers are needed in society.&nbsp;</p><p>Now in Dec. 2020, many people are still holed up waiting for a vaccine. The problem is when a vaccine for covid comes around it won't be the 99% that receive it first. Your life isn't worth that much. You're not important or wealthy or powerful. The people who will receive it first are the same people who can sit out a pandemic in the comfort of their home and have their necessities delivered by the working class. They tell everyone else to social distance and wear a mask but won’t do it themselves. Fucking Gavin Newsom.</p><p>Still, we are losing this class war as people continue to fight against their best interest. They believe lying politicians, lying scientists, and are manipulated by the news media. We are told to wait and trust while hundreds of thousands of people in the US die. While small businesses close at an unprecedented rate, but large corporations make billions.</p><p>What the fuck. They are killing us and taken what we own. Why are we still putting up with this?</p><p><b><span>We can take back what belongs to us by creating for ourselves.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>Science and medicine belong to us not them.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Biohack the fucking planet</span></b></p>

I think of 1-on-1s as my primary tools for connecting with an individual and working on their morale, engagement, productivity and growth.</p><p>I usually like to find out if my report wants to lead the conversation. You might start with a simple question. Do you have an agenda or something that's on your mind? If not, then I think about which one of the major points below I want to get into.</p><p>These are the high level areas I like to hit, and I've listed some relevant questions/prompts with each one. This isn't meant to be comprehensive, and it's not meant to be a script. I like my 1 on 1s to be more organic and I'll jump around these topics depending on how the conversation goes.</p><h2>How are you doing? (every 1-on-1)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. How's your project going?<br>&nbsp; 2. Are you struggling with anything?<br>&nbsp; 3. Can I help you knock down any barriers?<br>&nbsp; 4. Are there places I can step in and help facilitate communication with others?</p><h2>I've got some feedback for you. (Positive or negative. As often as needed)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. I've observed these things you've been doing<br>&nbsp; 2. I've gotten this input from people you've worked with<br>&nbsp; 3. This is how you did on recent projects<br>&nbsp; 4. Let's talk about this scenario where you did good/needed improvement</p><h2>Let's talk about what's happening around the org. (At least once a month. Definitely when significant changes have happened.)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. Can I address any recent changes that you're curious or concerned about?<br>&nbsp; 2. Can I address any rumors or things that worry you?<br>&nbsp; 3. Let me tell you what the leadership team has been talking about that may affect you.<br>&nbsp; 4. Let's talk about the wider org direction and make sure you're connected to what our business goals are.</p><h2>Let's talk about your career path. (Once a quarter at least. You can do this in smaller more frequent iterations too)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. Let's set some goals for the next few months<br>&nbsp; 2. Let's check in on the goals we set for you<br>&nbsp; 3. How can I create opportunities for your growth?<br>&nbsp; 4. Let's talk specifics on what's going to get you to the next level<br>&nbsp; 5. Let's talk more long term. Where do you wanna be in a few years?</p><h2>Let me tell you my thoughts on the direction of the team. (How often you do this depends a lot on your team and how your company operates)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. Here's what I think the priorities are for our team right now.<br>&nbsp; 2. Here's where I think we're doing well and where we have challenges.<br>&nbsp; 3. I'd like to get your opinions on these things and talk about where I think you can help move things forward.</p><p>Keep in mind that there is an implicit number zero here which is connecting on a personal level. Ideally I'm always building rapport and trust throughout 1-on-1s and in other scenarios. I find time to talk about family, recent events, hobbies, future plans, etc. I'll sometimes even let this conversation take up significant time in the 1-on-1. I don't like to make people feel rushed or that there's always something intense that we need to talk about.</p><p>There is some initial onboarding into 1-on-1s. The first several are going to be about getting to know my new report and finding out what they need from me. That requires some more targeted information gathering. Here’s a great post by Lara Hogan that focuses on that. <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/">Questions for our first 1:1</a></p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In recent years GraphQL has really taken off as a pattern/library/type system. It offers much which REST does not and its standardisation and flexibily has really helped in its adoption. When I began looking for a detailed explanation of how graphql works internally I struggled to find anything which was not too high-level. I wanted to see how the schema, query, types and resolvers all worked together mechanically.</p>
<p>Its not possible to focus on all parts in detail in this article so I have focused on the <b>execution</b> part of the query lifecycle.</p>

<h2 id="1-overview"><a href="#1-overview" aria-label="1 overview permalink"></a>1: Overview</h2>
<p>First we need to ask what is graphql? There are a couple of answers</p>
<p>It is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A type system - type definitions define how data should look. They are written to show what is included and highlight the relationships (how things relate). This system definition language can be transformed into AST.</li>
<li>A formal language for querying data - what to fetch from where.</li>
<li>Rules for validating or executing a query against the Schema.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point (3) above references the official <b>Specification</b> which defines the rules for types, validation and executing the schema. It can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://spec.graphql.org/">spec.graphql.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a documentation-friendly website <a href="https://graphql.org/learn">graphql.org/learn</a></p>
<p>All languages follow the spec, and the JS <code>graphql</code> library frequently references part of it. We will be looking at that library as part of this section.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-schema"><a href="#building-the-schema" aria-label="building the schema permalink"></a>Building the schema</h3>
<p>Building the schema is important part for a graphql application, as mentioned above it defines all types and their relationships. There are 2 steps to this</p>
<h4 id="1-parses-schema-notation-usually-found-in-a-schemagraphql-file-into-ast"><a href="#1-parses-schema-notation-usually-found-in-a-schemagraphql-file-into-ast" aria-label="1 parses schema notation usually found in a schemagraphql file into ast permalink"></a>1. Parses "schema notation" (usually found in a <code>schema.graphql</code> file) into AST</h4>
<p>The parser will throw errors if it is not a GraphQL schema. See snippet from <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/schema.js#L52">types/schema.js</a> (below)</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>isSchema</span><span>(</span><span>schema</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>instanceOf</span><span>(</span>schema<span>,</span> GraphQLSchema<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="2-transform-ast-into-objects-and-instances"><a href="#2-transform-ast-into-objects-and-instances" aria-label="2 transform ast into objects and instances permalink"></a>2. Transform AST into objects and instances</h4>
<p>We need a schema which is a type instance of <code>GraphQLSchema</code> (see above snippet). We then need objects inside the schema which match types, for example a scalar or an object.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/definition.js#L575">Example of a scalar</a> (below snippet)</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> OddType <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLScalarType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

<p>The native scalar types defined for GraphQL are <code>ID</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Boolean</code>. You can define your own inside your type system.</p>
<h4 id="summarise"><a href="#summarise" aria-label="summarise permalink"></a>Summarise</h4>
<p>Essentially for building the schema we turn this graphql schema notation:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Book <span>{</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>ID</span><span>!</span>
  title<span>:</span> String
  authors<span>:</span> <span>[</span>Author<span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Into this Javascript</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> Book <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLObjectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'Book'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLNonNull</span><span>(</span>GraphQLID<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    title<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLString</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    author<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLList</span><span>(</span>Author<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Almost all of the GraphQL types that you define will be object types. Object types have a name, but most importantly describe their fields.</p>
<p>A <code>GraphQLSchema</code> looks like the below in raw POJO form:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>GraphQLSchema {
  astNode: {
    kind: 'SchemaDefinition',
    ...
  },
  extensionASTNodes: [],
  _queryType: Query,
   ...
  _typeMap: {
    Query: Query,
    ID: ID,
    User: User,
    String: String,
    ...
  },
  ...
}</code></pre></div>
<p>It holds AST information too but the root Query and types are found under the <code>_typeMap</code> property.</p>
<h4 id="adding-resolvers"><a href="#adding-resolvers" aria-label="adding resolvers permalink"></a>Adding resolvers</h4>
<p>Resolvers cannot be included in the GraphQL schema language, so they must be added separately.</p>
<p>They are added to the <code>_typeMap</code> property, under <code>_typeMap.&lt;Type&gt;._fields.&lt;field&gt;</code>
So after adding the resolvers, a schema object might look like below:</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code> _typeMap<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
   Query<span>:</span> <span>{</span> _fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span> users<span>:</span> <span>{</span> resolve<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>function</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
   User<span>:</span> <span>{</span> _fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span> address<span>:</span> <span>{</span> resolve<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>function</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the HTTP request side the community has largely standardized on a HTTP POST method. But what happens when the server receives a query?</p>
<h3 id="query-lifecycle"><a href="#query-lifecycle" aria-label="query lifecycle permalink"></a>Query lifecycle</h3>
<p>The GraphQL spec outlines what is known as the "request lifecycle". This details what happens when a request reaches the server to produce the result.</p>
<p>There are 3 steps that occur once the lifecycle is triggered.</p>
<h4 id="1-parse-query"><a href="#1-parse-query" aria-label="1 parse query permalink"></a>1. Parse Query</h4>
<p>Here the server turns the query into AST. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lexical Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphQL's Lexer identifies the pieces (words/tokens) of the GraphQL query and assigns meaning to each</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntactic Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphQL's parser than checks whether the pieces conforms to the language syntax (grammar rules)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If both these pass the server can move on.</p>
<p>In <code>graphql-js</code> this is all found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/language/parser.js#L137">parser.js</a> file and function.</p>
<p>This query:</p>
<p><code>query homepage { posts { title author } }</code></p>
<p>Becomes the AST</p>

<p>You can see this for yourself on <a href="https://astexplorer.net/">astexplorer</a> under GraphQL.</p>
<h4 id="2-validate-query"><a href="#2-validate-query" aria-label="2 validate query permalink"></a>2. Validate Query</h4>
<p>This step ensures the request is executable against the provided Schema. Found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/validation/validate.js#L36">validate.js</a> in the <code>graphql-js</code> library.</p>
<p>While it is usally run just before execute, it can be useful to run in isolation. For example by a client before sending the query to the server. The benefit is that the validator could flag an invalid query before it is sent to the server, saving a HTTP request.</p>
<p>It works by <em>checking each field in the query AST document against its corresponding type definition in the schema object</em>. It will compare argument type compatibility as well as coercion checks.</p>
<h4 id="3-execute-query"><a href="#3-execute-query" aria-label="3 execute query permalink"></a>3. Execute Query</h4>
<p>This step is by far the most intensive and the step I often found the most confusing in its mechanism. We will be digging deeper into this step in part 2, so lets look at the process involved from a high-level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the operations i.e. a query or mutation? (several queries can be made at once)</li>
<li>Then resolve each operation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For step (2) each query/mutation is run in isolation.</p>
<h5 id="resolving-each-operation"><a href="#resolving-each-operation" aria-label="resolving each operation permalink"></a>Resolving each operation</h5>
<p>For step 2 GraphQL iterates over each field in the selection-set, if it is a scalar type resolve the field (<code>executeField</code>) else recurse the selection-sets until it resolves to a scalar.</p>
<p>The way this works is that the engine calls all fields on the root level at once and waits for all to return (this includes any promises). Then after reading the return type it cascades down the tree calling all sub-field resolvers with data from the parent resolver. Then it repeats this cascade on those field return types. So simply speaking it calls the top-level Query initially and then the root resolver for each type.</p>
<p>The mechanism caled "scalar coercion" comes into play here. Any values returned by the resolver are converted (based on the return type) in order to uphold the API contract. For example a resolver returning string "123" with a number type attached to it will return <code>Number("123")</code> (i.e a number).</p>
<p>This is found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/execution/execute.js#L103">execute.js</a> file and function inside <code>graphql-js</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly the result is returned.</p>
<h3 id="introspection-system"><a href="#introspection-system" aria-label="introspection system permalink"></a>Introspection system</h3>
<p>Its worth mentioning the introspection system. This is a mechanism used by the GraphQL API schema to allow clients to learn what types and operations are supported and in what format.</p>
<p>The clients can query the <code>__schema</code> field in the GraphQL API, which is always available on the root type of a Query.
Any interactive GraphQL UIs rely on sending an <code>IntrospectionQuery</code> request to the server, which builds documentation and auto-completion with it.</p>
<h3 id="libraries"><a href="#libraries" aria-label="libraries permalink"></a>Libraries</h3>
<p>As part of my research I covered many different libraries, so I thought it was worth giving a quick overview of the main ones in the JS ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="graphql-js"><a href="#graphql-js" aria-label="graphql js permalink"></a><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">graphql-js</a></h4>
<p>The reference implementation of the GraphQL spec, but also full of useful tools for building GraphQL servers, clients and tooling.
It's a GitHub organisation with many mono-repositories.</p>
<p>It performs the entire Query Lifecycle (including parsing schema notation).</p>
<h5 id="schema"><a href="#schema" aria-label="schema permalink"></a>Schema</h5>

<ul>
<li>Take output of introspection query and builds the schema out of it</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Summary: <code>ParseNumberF64</code>, <code>StringToDouble</code> and similarly named functions take
a string like <code>"12.5"</code> (one two dot five) and return a 64-bit double-precision
floating point number like <code>12.5</code> (twelve point five). Some numbers (like
<code>12.3</code>) aren’t exactly representable as an <code>f64</code> but <code>ParseNumberF64</code> still has
to return the best approximation. In March 2020, Daniel Lemire
<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/">published</a>
some <a href="https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser">source code</a> for a new,
fast algorithm to do this, based on an original idea by Michael Eisel. Here’s
how it works.</em></p>

<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>

<h3 id="fallback-implementation">Fallback Implementation</h3>

<p>First, a caveat. The Eisel-Lemire algorithm is very fast (<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/">Lemire’s blog
post</a>
contains impressive benchmark numbers, e.g. 9 times faster than the C standard
library’s <code>strtod</code>) but it isn’t comprehensive. There are a small proportion of
strings that are valid numbers but it cannot parse, where Eisel-Lemire will
fail over to a fallback <code>ParseNumberF64</code> implementation.</p>

<p><strong>The primary goal is speed, for 99+% of the cases, not 100% coverage</strong>. As
long as Eisel-Lemire doesn’t claim false positives, the combined approach is
both fast and correct. <em>Update on 2020-10-08: To be clear, combining with the
fallback means that Eisel-Lemire-with-the-fallback is (much) faster than
just-the-fallback, for ‘only’ 99+% of the cases, but <strong>still correct for 100%
of the cases</strong>, including subnormal numbers, infinities and all the rest.</em></p>

<p>If falling back to <code>strtod</code>, know that it can be sensitive to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator">locale-related</a> environment
variables (i.e. whether twelve point five is <code>"12.5"</code> or <code>"12,5"</code>). Discussing
fallback algorithms any further is out of scope for this blog post. <em>Update on
2020-11-02: the Simple Decimal Conversion fallback algorithm is discussed in
<a href="https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/parse-number-f64-simple.html">the next blog post</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>

<p>Let <code>[I .. J]</code> denote the half-open range of numbers simultaneously greater
than or equal to <code>I</code> and less than <code>J</code>. The lower bound is inclusive but the
upper bound is exclusive.</p>

<p>Let <code>[I ..= J]</code> denote a closed range, where the upper bound is now inclusive
and its the constraint is now “less than or equal to”.</p>

<p>Let <code>(X ** Y)</code> denote <code>X</code> raised to the <code>Y</code>th power. For example, here are some
different ways to write “one thousand”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e3</code></li>
  <li><code>1000</code></li>
  <li><code>10 ** 3</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, here are some different ways to write “sixty four”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>0x40</code></li>
  <li><code>64</code></li>
  <li><code>2 ** 6</code></li>
  <li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 6</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Exponents can be negative. <code>(10 ** -1)</code> is one tenth and <code>(2 ** -3)</code> is one
eighth.</p>

<p>Let <code>A ~MOD+ B</code> denote modular addition, where the modulus is usually clear
from the context. For example, working with <code>u8</code> values would use a modulus of
<code>256</code>. <code>(100 + 200)</code> would normally be <code>300</code>, which overflows a <code>u8</code>, but <code>(100
~MOD+ 200)</code> would be <code>44</code> without overflow. In C/C++, for unsigned integer
types, the <code>"~MOD+"</code> operator is simply spelled <code>"+"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="double-precision-floating-point">Double-Precision Floating Point</h3>

<p>In C/C++, this type is called <code>double</code>. Go calls it <code>float64</code>. Rust calls it
<code>f64</code>. We’ll use <code>f64</code> in this blog post, as well as <code>u64</code> for 64-bit unsigned
integers and <code>i32</code> for 32-bit signed integers.</p>

<p>Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">double-precision floating
point</a>
article has a lot of detail. More briefly, a 64-bit value (e.g.
<code>0x40840000_00000000</code>) is split into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 sign bit: here, <code>0x0</code>, meaning non-negative</li>
  <li>11 exponent bits with a 1023 bias: here, <code>0x408 - 1023 = 9</code></li>
  <li>52 mantissa bits and, for normal numbers, an implicit 53rd bit set on: here,
<code>0x40000_00000000</code> is implicitly <code>0x140000_00000000</code> whose 53 bits, in
binary, is <code>0b10100_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000</code>,
interpreted as <code>((1*1) + (0*½) + (1*¼) + (0*⅛) + etc) = 1.25</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Let <code>AsF64(0x40840000_00000000)</code> denote reinterpreting those 64 bits as an
<code>f64</code> bit pattern. Its value is therefore <code>(1.25 * (2 ** 9))</code>, which is <code>640</code>
in decimal. An equivalent derivation starts with <code>0x00140000_00000000 =
5629499534213120</code> and then <code>(5629499534213120 &gt;&gt; (52-9)) = 640</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code> and <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000001)</code> are
<code>9007199254740992</code> and <code>9007199254740994</code> in decimal, also known as <code>((1&lt;&lt;53) +
0)</code> and <code>((1&lt;&lt;53) + 2)</code>. The integer in between, <code>9007199254740993 = ((1&lt;&lt;53) +
1)</code>, is not exactly representable as an <code>f64</code>. Relatedly, the slightly smaller
<code>9007199254740991 = ((1&lt;&lt;53) - 1)</code> is also known in JavaScript as
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER"><code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code></a>.</p>

<p>The sign bit (corresponding to a leading <code>"-"</code> minus sign in the string form)
is trivial to parse and we won’t spend any more time discussing it.</p>

<p>Non-normal numbers include subnormal numbers (with a biased exponent of
<code>0x000</code>) and non-finite numbers (with a biased exponent of <code>0x7FF</code> and whose
value is either infinite or Not-a-Number). We similarly won’t spend much time
on these.</p>

<h3 id="round-to-even">Round To Even</h3>

<p>Typically, when rounding a decimal fraction to an integer, <code>7.3</code> rounds down to
<code>7</code> and <code>7.6</code> rounds up to <code>8</code>. Rounding numbers like <code>7.5</code>, half-way between
two integers, is subject to more debate. One option is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounding to
even</a>, alternating between rounding
down and up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>70.5</code> rounds to <code>70</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>71.5</code> rounds to <code>72</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li><code>72.5</code> rounds to <code>72</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>73.5</code> rounds to <code>74</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li><code>74.5</code> rounds to <code>74</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>75.5</code> rounds to <code>76</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Properly parsing <code>f64</code> values similarly rounds to even: the evenness of the
least significant bit of the 53-bit mantissa. This isn’t necessarily the same
as rounding the overall value to an integer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>9007199254740990</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x433FFFFF_FFFFFFFE)</code></li>

<h3 id="static-single-assignment">Static Single Assignment</h3>

<p>For clarity, this blog post presents the Eisel-Lemire algorithm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static
Single Assignment</a>
form. For example, a separate <code>AdjE2_1</code> variable is defined below, based on
<code>AdjE2_0</code>, instead of destructively modifying a single <code>AdjE2</code> variable over
time. Implementations are obviously free to use a more traditional imperative
programming style.</p>

<h3 id="multiplying-two-u64-values">Multiplying Two <code>u64</code> Values</h3>

<p>Some compilers (and some <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mul">instruction
sets</a>) provide a built-in <code>u128</code>
representation for multiplying two <code>u64</code> values without overflow. When they
don’t, it’s <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/ba3818cb6b473a2ed0b38ecfc07dbbd3a97e8ae7/internal/cgen/base/fundamental-public.h#L457-L469">relatively
straightfoward</a>
to implement with <code>u64</code> operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each <code>u64</code> is split into a high and low 32 bits.</li>
  <li>The four cross-pairs are multiplied (without overflowing a <code>u64</code>).</li>
  <li>The four overlapping <code>u64</code> values are re-assembled into a <code>u128</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pre-computed-powers-of-10">Pre-computed Powers-of-10</h3>

<p>The smallest and largest positive, finite <code>f64</code> values, <code>DBL_TRUE_MIN</code> and
<code>DBL_MAX</code>, are approximately <code>4.94e-324</code> and <code>1.80e+308</code>. We’ll pre-compute two
approximations, called the <em>narrow</em> (low resolution) and <em>wide</em> (high
resolution) approximations, to each power-of-10 in a range, such as from
<code>1e-325</code> to <code>1e+308</code> inclusive. Implementations can <a href="https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser/issues/28">choose a smaller
range</a>, discussed in
the <code>Exp10</code> Range section below.</p>

<p>For each base-10 exponent <code>E10</code>, the narrow approximation to <code>(10 ** E10)</code> is
the unique pair of a <code>u64</code>-typed mantissa <code>M64</code> and an <code>i32</code>-typed base-2
exponent <code>E2</code> such that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The high bit of <code>M64</code> is set: <code>M64 &gt;= 0x80000000_00000000</code>.</li>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) &gt;= ((M64 + 0)   * (2 ** E2))</code></li>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) &lt;  ((M64 + 1)   * (2 ** E2))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>&gt;=</code> in the first condition is <code>==</code> when the approximation is exact. When
inexact, the approximation rounds down (truncates). Whether exact or not, the
residual <code>R64</code>, defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) =  ((M64 + R64) * (2 ** E2))</code> or, equivalently,</li>
  <li><code>R64 = ((10 ** E10) / (2 ** E2)) - M64</code></li>
</ul>

<p>implies that <code>R64</code> is in the range <code>[0 .. 1]</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s an exact example, for <code>1e3</code>, also known as <code>(250 * 4)</code> or <code>(0xFA &lt;&lt; 2)</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e3    = (0xFA000000_00000000 * (2 ** -54))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an inexact example, for <code>1e43</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e43   ≈ (0xE596B7B0_C643C719 * (2 **  79))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, these two numbers bracket <code>1e43</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C719 &lt;&lt; 79) =  9999999999999999999741184793924429452148736</code></li>
  <li><code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C71A &lt;&lt; 79) = 10000000000000000000345647703731744039501824</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C719, 79)</code> pair represents an inclusive-lower
exclusive-upper bound range for <code>1e43</code>.</p>

<h3 id="look-up-table-columns">Look-Up Table Columns</h3>

<p>The narrow powers-of-10 look-up table has two columns for each <code>E10</code> row: <code>M64</code>
and <code>NarrowBiasedE2</code>. The <code>NarrowBiasedE2</code> value is <code>E2</code> plus a <code>NarrowBias</code>
constant (the magical number <code>1150</code>)  which is discussed later.</p>

<p>The wide approximation is like the narrow one except its mantissa <code>M128</code> is 128
bits instead of 64.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e43   = (0xE596B7B0_C643C719_6D9CCD05_D0000000 * (2 **  15))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The wide powers-of-10 look-up table splits <code>M128</code>’s bits in half to have three
columns: <code>M128Lo</code>, <code>M128Hi</code> and <code>WideBiasedE2</code>. For the <code>1e43</code> example, these
are <code>0x6D9CCD05_D0000000</code>, <code>0xE596B7B0_C643C719</code> and <code>(WideBias + 15)</code>. The
last two columns are shared with the narrow look-up table (<code>M64 = M128Hi</code> and
<code>WideBias = NarrowBias + 64 = 1214</code>) so that a single table holds both the
narrow and wide approximations.</p>

<p>The powers-of-10 look-up table is generated by <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/ba3818cb6b473a2ed0b38ecfc07dbbd3a97e8ae7/script/print-mpb-powers-of-10.go">this Go
program</a>.
The two <code>u64</code> columns are explicitly printed, and the one <code>i32</code> column is
implied by a linear expression with slope <code>log(10)/log(2)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="eisel-lemire-algorithm">Eisel-Lemire Algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="manexp10-form"><code>Man:Exp10</code> Form</h3>

<p>Parsing starts by converting the string to an integer mantissa and base-10
exponent. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>"1.23e45"</code> becomes <code>(123    * (10 ** 43))</code></li>
  <li><code>"67800.0"</code> becomes <code>(678    * (10 **  2))</code></li>
  <li><code>"3.14159"</code> becomes <code>(314159 * (10 ** -5))</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="small-value-fast-path">Small-Value Fast Path</h3>

<p>If the mantissa is zero, then the parsed <code>f64</code> is trivially zero.</p>

<p>If the mantissa is non-zero but less than <code>(1 &lt;&lt; 53)</code> then it is still exactly
representable as an <code>f64</code>. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the challenges of a tech career is the necessity to stay up-to-date on technology advancements. A key part of your ability to solve business problems with technology is understanding how to use the latest advancements to create a solution. Therefore your value as an individual contributor or manager is partially driven by the amount of knowledge that you have cultivated during your life.</p><h2 id="technology-is-a-moving-target">Technology is a Moving Target</h2><p>Acquiring this knowledge isn’t easy. Over the last 30 years, information technology has advanced at a breakneck pace. Complexity has exploded as well. It’s certainly not possible for one person to know everything in tech. But it’s become impossible to have comprehensive knowledge even about a single technology product in many cases.</p><p>For example, take Microsoft SQL Server, a commonly used relational database. Early in my career, one of my areas of expertise was SQL Server. I learned how to install it, support it and troubleshoot it. I became proficient in writing queries in Transact-SQL, SQL Server’s query language. I learned how to performance tune queries and how to efficiently transfer data in and out of the database. At the time, that was pretty much everything I needed to know to be considered a SQL Server expert.</p><p>But that was in the early 90’s and SQL Server was about to explode in complexity. Microsoft acquired a few companies and integrated these new products into the SQL Server platform. A data warehousing engine was added with its own tools and query language. New capabilities were added to run highly available and scalable implementations like failover clustering and database mirroring. This added large new surface areas that SQL Server experts had to learn about.</p><p>Many of these new product features became their own categories of expertise. Instead of generalist SQL Server experts, we started seeing niche specializations like SQL Server data warehouse experts or a query tuning experts. When it became common to shift database workloads to the cloud, traditional SQL Server roles transformed even more radically.</p><p>This constant advancement of the tools we work with in tech forces us to frequently reframe our value proposition as a worker. A successful technology career will require lifetime learning to stay relevant.</p><p>Continuous career education is not an easy path. Although it can be difficult to keep up, the fact is that the more knowledge you have, the more value you can add to your employer in the modern business environment. Your knowledge becomes a competitive differentiator for you in the workplace. The more knowledge you have, the more likely it is you will get that new job or that promotion. This is somewhat unique to particular lines of work like technology, and obviously knowledge is not the only job skill you need. But in many tech jobs, knowledge is perhaps your greatest asset. You need to plan carefully to cultivate this knowledge.</p><h2 id="side-project-oriented-learning">Side Project-Oriented Learning</h2><p>It should be clear that effective career education cannot be a one-time event. Although a college education is still important, the skills you learn in those four years are not enough to sustain a forty year career. Learning needs to be continuous. In the modern world, knowledge has a shelf-life (as opposed to wisdom that stands the tests of time).</p><p>Successful tech workers have a process to learn about their field continuously. Often it’s not intentional but simply an enjoyable pursuit. Many software engineers love coding and learn through side projects. They identify new programming languages or tech stacks they would like to add to their resumes and work on related projects in their spare time. The side project becomes a form of training, just like elite military forces that train through simulated scenarios to develop their skills in a low-stakes setting.</p><h2 id="learning-at-work">Learning at Work</h2><p>The most effective learning will probably come from your 9-to-5 job. Your job is by far the most valuable source of education. This knowledge grows out of the trials and tribulations of real world scenarios. On-the-job training allows you to clearly see the impact of your successes and failures. You can observe how your work output affects your team and your employer’s results. The beauty is that you can learn not just from the effort that you put into a specific project, but also from the consequences your work has on the larger systems you are working within. You can’t easily get this contextual learning from individual side-projects.</p><p>If you write some poorly structured code on a hobby project, it’s likely you will never suffer the negative consequences. Therefore you won’t learn from it. But in a real work environment, your poor code will impact your team and your employer. This technical debt that you have created could slow your team members down and make them miss an important deadline. Or even worse, your code could cause a problem in production that affects customers and hurts your employer’s bottom line. You will be forced to confront the choices you’ve made in the past, and you will gain valuable experience correcting problems caused by previous mistakes.</p><p>Although unpleasant, these challenges are the fire that will forge your growth as an effective technology worker.</p><h2 id="choosing-the-right-job">Choosing the Right Job</h2><p>Don’t have a tech job yet? You can still apply the same mindset to whatever your current job or daily pursuits are. Even if you’re working as a barista or an Amazon driver, you are still presented with so many learning opportunities each day. You can learn how to deal with customers or coworkers, develop a deeper understanding of the software you use in your job, and overcome whatever mental challenges your job entails. No matter what you do on a daily basis, if you approach your day looking at each challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, you will find that over time you will develop the knowledge and discipline that will move your career forward.</p><p>When making decisions about a new job opportunity, it’s important to consider how much you will learn from the role. Many don’t think about this and choose jobs simply based on factors like company reputation, job title, or compensation. However working for a highly regarded company with a respected job title may not necessarily put you in a good position to learn the job skills you need to move forward in your current career path.</p><p>You want to look for jobs that offer knowledge content that aligns with your learning strategy, while at the same time provides enough challenge so that you will be pushed beyond your comfort zone. This is the recipe for a high-learning job situation.</p><p>Sometimes it will be necessary to move into a job at a smaller company with less salary to achieve this. Smaller companies can offer more variety in daily tasks since job descriptions are usually less siloed. If your goal is to learn about artificial intelligence and you are working at a large company doing something unrelated to AI, it will be difficult to get that exposure unless top management decides to create an AI team or project. Even then you will be competing with your coworkers to get involved.</p><p>At a smaller company, there is often more flexibility. Perhaps you have a general job like software engineer or business analyst and you work on your employer’s client-facing web applications. If you want to get exposure to artificial intelligence, it’s may be possible to work relevant projects into your day-to-day job. You can look for opportunities to use AI in a way that relates to the software you’re working with and determine how it could provide business value. Pitching a project with real business benefits to your boss can put you in a position to dabble with the technology you want to learn.</p><p>The key is to solve a real business problem. In the less-structured organization of a smaller employer, you can often achieve flexibility to work on the tech you’re interested in because there is a lack of standards and policies that you will find in a larger IT organization. Smaller IT teams usually have less need for top-down controls about programming languages, frameworks, third-party APIs, cloud services, etc.</p><p>These aren’t universal truths and it’s completely possible to find flexibility in large companies and a lack of autonomy in small companies. But it is a key consideration you should evaluate when you decide whether to accept a new job.</p><h2 id="maximizing-your-personal-learning-time">Maximizing your Personal Learning Time</h2><p>Outside of work or side projects, it’s important that you allocate some personal time to learn on a consistent basis. This personal learning will provide foundational knowledge for the tasks you perform as part of your job. For this learning, you might choose to read books, industry journals, blog posts, or tech vendor educational content. Podcasts and educational videos are also great sources of content. Everyone learns differently so you have to chose the media format that is most effective for you. Podcasts and audio books are great for learning while doing physical activity or commuting. Blogs or journals are great to read on your phone when you get a bit of free time. Reading books, especially technology or business content, requires a bit more focus and you should set aside time each day to eliminate distractions to do some deep reading and thinking.</p><p>Daily reading and study provides context and depth of understanding, but it becomes far more valuable when you can make connections between your personal learning and your work. I have found that I’m far more motivated to read a book or watch video training when it’s specifically relevant to a problem I’m currently trying to solve at work. The content becomes a clue in my search for a solution. Not only is it more compelling when the content is relevant but it makes it easier to retain information.</p><p>There will be other cases where you are drawn to a topic simply because you find it interesting. It may have absolutely no relevance with your current work or side projects. When something triggers your curiosity like this, by …</p></div></div>

I acknowledge the importance of having a schedule, but chunking my creative time into slots on a calendar feels like I’m sacrificing the freedom required to unearth interesting ideas.</p><p>Oftentimes, being able to name the problem goes a long way, and I’d like to delineate between the two styles of thought here:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><span><strong>Focused Thought</strong></span> is what guides our work lives, primarily because it’s tied to a practical end result. This result has been imagined from the beginning, so Focused Thought is about investing the energy necessary to have the present moment catch up with that future goal. The most pressing example today would be all the people working tirelessly to create a coronavirus vaccine. They embarked on this journey knowing exactly what they wanted, and they will rigorously follow whatever road looks promising to get them to that goal.</p><p><span><strong>Fluid Thought</strong></span>, on the other hand, has no end state in mind. It’s thinking for the sake of thinking. There is no practical value to extract, no expectation to fulfill. It’s like being in a rowboat in a vast ocean without any particular place to go. All you must do is row aimlessly, and take in all the observations you make along your little journey.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fluid Thought is about emptying any desire to be productive or useful, and instead becoming a blank canvas for whatever your curiosity comes into contact with. An idea is no longer interesting because of what you can do with it; it’s interesting simply because it’s interesting. You don’t need to <a href="https://moretothat.com/knowledge-is-not-a-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">store it as knowledge</a> to regurgitate later, as coming into contact with it is all that matters.</p><p>This is a remarkably difficult thing to do, especially because we’ve been conditioned to learn with an end goal in mind. From grade school to college, we learn things because we have an exam to pass. When we enter the workplace, we learn because we want to “add value” to our team (and get paid in the process). When we do creative work, we learn because we want to build things that are useful for our audience.</p><p>The problem, however, is that all this conditioning goes against the actual nature of our minds. If you take 10 minutes to sit down and do nothing, you’ll see how random and sporadic your thoughts actually are. The mind is exploratory by nature, but we’ve trained it to think linearly because we have been incentivized to prioritize Focused Thought. After all, the more we tie our worth to <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-omnipresence-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the societal value we produce</a>, the more goal-oriented we become.</p><p>Fluid Thought is a return to how our minds actually work. Exploring without expecting is <a href="https://moretothat.com/what-is-the-present-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what it means to be present</a>. Thinking without striving is <a href="https://moretothat.com/happiness-is-a-serious-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what it means to be introspective</a>. By putting aside the desire to make something out of everything, we allow our childlike wonderment to re-emerge and learn from a truly earnest place.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>I try to keep this in mind as I navigate my path as a writer.</p><p>Since writing is such a cognitively demanding exercise, it’s dominated by the presence of Focused Thought. This is even more relevant since I also publish my work, which means that I can’t just blurt out random thoughts on a page, and expect the result to be cohesive enough to be digested by another mind. I have to take time to formulate my thoughts, let them marinate, and structure them so that they’re clear enough to whoever might come across my work.</p><p>However, writing with an end goal in mind makes my thinking rigid, and cuts off the tangential threads that are unwoven naturally when thought is more exploratory. Too much linear thinking can make writing feel like a task, where the completion of one piece just means that it’s time to go looking for another topic to discuss. Repeat this process long enough, and you can see why so many people become disillusioned with it fairly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fortunately, there is an antidote to this, and it applies to any form of expression:</p><p><span><strong>Introduce time for Fluid Thought on a regular basis.</strong></span></p><p>By giving yourself the space to explore without expectation, you give your mind the freedom to play with whatever idea it comes into contact with. There is nothing that idea has to become; there is nothing you need to store to use for later. All that matters is that you’re wandering about, spending time in a playground that will disappear shortly afterward.</p><p>The way I put this into practice is by journaling every single day. I think in the last two years, I may have missed just two sessions – that’s how important the practice is to me.</p><p>This is because journaling carries no expectations, and gives me the space to write without any judgment whatsoever. When I open up my journal each day, I have no clue what will be written down by the end of the entry. All I do is put my pen to paper, and have my hand act as a mere conduit to whatever my mind wants to explore. It can be nonsensical, it can be stupid, it can be forgotten.</p><p>And all of that is perfectly fine.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Perhaps the greatest thing about Fluid Thought is that it reintroduces the beginner’s mind, or what the Zen Buddhists call <em>shoshin</em>. When you have no expectations, you drop all the defense mechanisms you’ve developed in your <a href="https://moretothat.com/pursue-mastery-not-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuit of mastery</a>, and reset your curiosity back to its baseline levels. This allows you to experiment with all kinds of novel ideas, as you have nothing to lose by doing so.</p><p>The same thing applies in the realm of learning. So much of what we learn is done for the purposes of what we can teach. But with Fluid Thought, we can read a book simply to enjoy it, without expecting any knowledge or wisdom in return for our attention. This is why I’ve been reading more fiction these days, as I know that I’m not delving into the pages so I can find material to write about afterward. I’m there to get lost in the story, and to be part of an adventure that is devoid of any obvious personal utility.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The paradox of Fluid Thought is that it’s easily accessible, but is difficult to enter into. This is because we live in a world where we are rewarded to provide value, so Focused Thought will always feel more practical. An efficient hustle receives far more praise than an aimless meander, so having goals and visions will be the default setting our minds operate on.</p><p>But take this mindset out too far, and we will forever be slaves to the future. Focused Thought is inherently about looking ahead, whereas Fluid Thought is about being immersed in the moment. Paradoxically, you must balance both by dropping your present expectations to position yourself toward a brighter future.</p><p>I’m reminded here of a Daoist concept called <em>wu-wei</em>, which roughly translates to “effortless action.” It’s about moving alongside the fabric of reality with action, but doing it in a seamless manner so you don’t create friction. To maintain a sense of serenity while meeting the demands of your everyday life.</p><p>In the end, that might be the best way to frame the power of Fluid Thought.</p><p>_______________</p><div id="custom_html-5"><div><div>  <p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png"><img src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png" alt="" width="1500" height="790"></a></p><p>  If you enjoyed this post, consider joining the More To That newsletter.

							<p>Last year, we showed you a <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2019/12/smalltalk-with-the-graalvm.html">Smalltalk live programming system running on top of GraalVM</a>. This year, <a href="https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/swa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we</a> bring some of the live programming experience from <a href="https://squeak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squeak/Smalltalk</a> to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraalVM</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language Server Protocol (LSP)</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before we show you some demos and take a look at some implementation details, we briefly give you a tour of “example-based live programming” (ELP).</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live programming</a> is a form of interactive, exploratory programming. The goal of it is to help developers better understand the dynamic behavior of the programs that they build. For this, live programming provides short feedback loops during programming. Instead of having to recompile and re-run an application, live programming systems allow developers to <a href="https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/06/incremental-development-environments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolve applications at run-time</a>. Thereby, they can immediately observe the effects of their modifications.</p>
<p>One style of live programming is&nbsp;built around the idea of examples. Systems that support this allow developers to&nbsp;<em>exemplify</em> their code with annotations. Such examples usually define a receiver, arguments, and optional code for setup and teardown. Here’s what that looks like in <a href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Babylonian/JS</a>, an ELP system we’ve built in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lively_Kernel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lively Kernel</a>:</p>

<p>These examples are then used by the programming environment to re-run annotated functions on every code change. Developers can add so-called <em>probes</em>&nbsp;to individual expressions to see intermediate results of all evaluations of an expression during the execution of the example. In the following screenshot, there are two probes – one defined on the&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;variable and the other one on <em>this.ctx</em>:</p>

<p>A variety of different kinds of probes exists in example-based live programming systems. <em>Assertion probes</em>, for example,&nbsp;check the expression result against an assertion. <em>Expression probes</em>&nbsp;allow the evaluation of additional code inline. If you’d like to learn more about ELP systems, have a look at our research paper on <a href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Babylonian-style Programming</em></a>.</p>
<p>While this makes for a rich, interactive programming experience, building ELP systems requires a lot of effort. Creating such systems can entail modifications throughout the whole stack of a programming ecosystem including the code editor, the reflection protocol, the parser and compiler, and the virtual machine. As a consequence, implementations are usually tightly integrated with a particular programming environment and virtual machine. So far, it was therefore necessary to start from scratch to build systems like this for other languages or editors.<br>
As it turned out, GraalVM and the Language Server Protocol can dramatically reduce such efforts. More on that later, time to show you some demos of our latest ELP system!</p>
<h2>Demos</h2>
<p>A video is worth a thousand words, and it makes sense to see our new ELP system in action before we look at its implementation. Let’s start with a simple demo showing how our system can be used to interactively implement a Fibonacci function:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZCGGIV-aRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As you’ve seen, our ELP system provides immediate feedback as well as a consistent programming experience across the languages supported by GraalVM. Furthermore, it integrates other tools, such as a simple object inspector or a debugger. But what we think is even more interesting than this, is that the system can also be used for <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/polyglot-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building polyglot applications</a> – that is, building software in multiple languages at the same time:</p>

<h2>GraalVM and Language-agnostic Tools</h2>
<p>As you may already know, GraalVM is <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-ten-things-12d9111f307d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">far more</a> than just a JVM on steroids. Its ecosystem provides <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powerful tools for debugging and monitoring</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truffle framework</a> for building fast language interpreters, and a lot more. A key feature of most GraalVM tools is that they work across multiple programming languages. GraalVM supports the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/tools/dap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug Adapter Protocol</a>, for example, which is what we’ve used to debug across languages in the second demo. This is only possible because the tool implementation does not rely on any language specifics. Instead, the implementation is entirely based on Truffle’s <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/graalvm-as-a-platform/implement-instrument/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instrument API</a>, just like all other GraalVM polyglot tools.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3359619.3359746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we worked with the GraalVM team</a> on a language-agnostic <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/tools/lsp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation of a language server</a> for the LSP. With this language server, GraalVM can provide developers with common programming features (e.g., auto-completion or go to definition) for all its languages and within different programming environments. Here’s how this works:<a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img data-attachment-id="2789" data-permalink="https://www.javaadvent.com/2020/12/live-programming-with-the-graalvm-the-lsp-and-vs-code.html/graalvm-lsp" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?fit=1600%2C776&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1600,776" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GraalVM and the LSP" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?fit=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?fit=600%2C291&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=600%2C291&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="291" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=1536%2C745&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=1240%2C601&amp;ssl=1 1240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=508%2C246&amp;ssl=1 508w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As the developer modifies the program through the programming environment, the GraalVM language server analyzes the code of the program. When auto-completion is triggered by the developer, for example, the server can provide appropriate suggestions to the programming environment on request. Both communicate through the LSP.</p>
<p>All you need to try this out, apart from a GraalVM installation of course, is a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code editor or IDE with LSP support</a>. For Visual Studio Code, GraalVM ships an <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/tools/vscode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension</a> that helps you to set everything up.</p>
<h2>Building a Live Feedback Loop on Top of the LSP and GraalVM</h2>
<p>Together with some of our graduate students, we wanted to find out whether we can build a live programming system independent of both the language and the programming environment. If it is possible to build a language-agnostic debugger, we could probably use GraalVM and Truffle for building the live system independent of the language. And we could use the LSP to decouple the tool’s backend from the programming environment. However, a key requirement for a live system is a fast feedback loop. That usually means it should provide feedback in under a second, which is considered the threshold after which a user starts wondering if an interactive system is still responding<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124079144000117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The LSP already communicates common file operations (e.g., open, modify, and close events) to a language server. It also supports <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#command" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commands</a> that can be executed by a code editor. <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#notificationMessage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notification messages</a> can trigger events in the editor. Therefore, all we had to do is implement a command for the analysis of exemplified code in the language server. To inform the user about the progress of the analysis, the server can send appropriate notification messages. Conceptually, this works as follows:</p>

<p>Every time the developer modifies the program, the GraalVM language server runs our analysis. It reports results&nbsp;through the LSP to the programming environment, which visualizes them. Now, we only need to make sure this loop runs fast enough.</p>
<h2>Implementing new LSP Commands</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some code and implement a command for the GraalVM language server. New LSP commands can be added to the server with a class that extends <em><a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/409535d77c291da23e19cb81788e57c78585721a/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation/src/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/TruffleInstrument.java#L121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TruffleInstrument</a></em> and implements the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/409535d77c291da23e19cb81788e57c78585721a/tools/src/org.graalvm.tools.api.lsp/src/org/graalvm/tools/api/lsp/LSPExtension.java#L35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LSPExtension</em></a>&nbsp;interface. Such a class can then provide multiple <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/409535d77c291da23e19cb81788e57c78585721a/tools/src/org.graalvm.tools.api.lsp/src/org/graalvm/tools/api/lsp/LSPCommand.java#L34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LSPCommands</em></a>. Here’s a simple&nbsp;example:</p>
<pre>class RudolphCommand implements LSPCommand {
  String getName() {
    return "rudolph";
  }

  Object execute(LSPServerAccessor server, Env env, List&lt;Object&gt; arguments) {
   return "Happy Holidays!";
  }
}</pre>
<p>When we now run the GraalVM language server with our code put on the classpath, the server will automatically pick up our new command. In VS Code, we can then trigger the command as follows:</p>
<div>
<pre>vscode.commands.executeCommand('rudolph').then((result) =&gt; {
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(result as string);
});</pre>
</div>
<p>As a result of this example, the user will see “Happy Holidays!” as an information message displayed in VS Code when the above is executed by an extension.</p>
<p>An ELP system needs to do a bit more work than that of course. To keep it simple, here’s some pseudo code that shows how the analysis works conceptionally:</p>
<pre>Object execute(LSPServerAccessor s, Env e, List&lt;Object&gt; a) {
  <span><span data-hydro-click="{&quot;event_type&quot;:&quot;code_navigation.click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;payload&quot;:{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;repository_id&quot;:302272162,&quot;ref&quot;:&quot;main&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Java&quot;,&quot;originating_url&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/hpi-swa/polyglot-live-programming/blob/main/src/de.hpi.swa.liveprogramming/src/de/hpi/swa/liveprogramming/BabylonianAnalysisExtension.java?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:2368856}}" data-hydro-click-hmac="1d766e023e7195b2c03a7611c2fbc73b16b9e876a07b77bac1634c0ffc1bbcc1">AnalysisResult</span></span> result <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span><span data-hydro-click="{&quot;event_type&quot;:&quot;code_navigation.click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;payload&quot;:{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;repository_id&quot;:302272162,&quot;ref&quot;:&quot;main&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Java&quot;,&quot;originating_url&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/hpi-swa/polyglot-live-programming/blob/main/src/de.hpi.swa.liveprogramming/src/de/hpi/swa/liveprogramming/BabylonianAnalysisExtension.java?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:2368856}}" data-hydro-click-hmac="1d766e023e7195b2c03a7611c2fbc73b16b9e876a07b77bac1634c0ffc1bbcc1">AnalysisResult</span></span>();
  findExamplesAndEvaluateFilesOpenedInEditor(s, e, result);
  ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; f = sendUpdatesPeriodically(s, result);
  try {
    for (Example example : result.getExamples()) {
      runExampleInstrumented(e, result, example);
    }
  } finally {
    f.cancel(true);
  }
  return result;
}</pre>
<p>First, all files opened in the editor are scanned for examples and probes, which are managed in a result object. The files are then evaluated using the instrument’s <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/TruffleInstrument.Env.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Env</em></a> object. After that, all examples are executed and instrumented using <em><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/ExecutionEventNode.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExecutionEventNodes</a></em>&nbsp;from the Instrument API. While the examples are running, we periodically send the result object with intermediate results via notifications over to the programming environment. This way, the system can provide feedback in under a second, even when examples take more time to run.&nbsp;And finally, we return the result object signaling that the analysis is complete.</p>

December 13, 2020 | https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20201212 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20201212">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I'm often amazed by all the mysterious behavior of my Windows machine. I'm totally incompetent with this type of Operating System and I'll not go deep into his configuration. </p>
<p>So let's see how this W10 machine will react against my OpenBSD desktop. In both cases I'll let open the same applications.</p>
<p>Both machines must use my own DNS server to go to internet. So, I'll compare the logs of my DNS in both cases. </p>

<p>On my home network, an OpenBSD serve is serving as dhcp &amp; dns server and as firewall. This machine will become the default gateway to go to internet. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20201212/setup.png"></p>
<p>I'll let the both machines runs the same among of time: 45 hours</p>
<p>On OpenBSD, I'm using OpenBSD-6.8 with Openbox and Tint2 for the graphical user unterface.</p>
<p>My windows Machine is running Wndows10-1904 with bitdefender as antivirus. For my daily job, I need to use Citrix client. You will see it in the results. </p>
<p>Applications running will be:<br>
- Chrome with 2 tabs: linkedin.com and gmail.com<br>
- thunderbird</p>
<p>The machine will just be rebooted before the test and will not be used, I just keep it running. </p>
<p>Both machines are lenovo T460</p>

<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20201212/results.png"></p>
<h2>global connections</h2>
<p>It's not a surprise that W10 is more using internet. 5375 connections against 1047 on OpenBSD. </p>
<h2>Antivirus</h2>
<p>We see that the W10 anti virus is using regularly Internet. Even if we remove this type of connections, W10 is using 2x more Internet than OpenBSD</p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p>We see that W10 is much more interacting with google servers than OpenBSD. A more deep analysis would be interesting. Anyhow, I can show the top most url used by W10:</p>
<pre><code>play.google.com.    440
mail.google.com.    275
safebrowsing.googleapis.com.    93
clientservices.googleapis.com.  91
0.client-channel.google.com.    45
mail-ads.google.com.    45
</code></pre>
<p>On OpenBSD the top google connections are:</p>
<pre><code>mtalk.google.com.   188
play.google.com.    86
update.googleapis.com.  36
www.googleapis.com. 26
</code></pre>
<h2>home.lan</h2>
<p>Interestingly, W10 is looking for several machines on my home lan. Here after those names and their occurences:</p>
<pre><code>wpad.home.lan.  319
_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.home.lan.  2
lpgwmxrst.home.lan. 1
leyswydcvc.home.lan.    1
smlmiux.home.lan.   1
fzyotbnefb.home.lan.    1
eqnyycgfw.home.lan. 1
qumutqusdzayk.home.lan. 1
</code></pre>
<p>What is that ? </p>
<p>OpenBSD is not requesting such home.lan</p>
<h2>Intel</h2>
<p>Apparently W10 is connecting to Intel web sites. But it's not for what I though:</p>
<pre><code>gameplay.intel.com. 2
gameplayapi.intel.com.  2
</code></pre>
<h2>Linkedin.com</h2>
<p>Amazinly, OpenBSD is connecting more frequently than W10. Strange<br>
Could be linked to the activity on my account. More news, more refresh, or something like that. </p>
<p>On the W10, the requests were:</p>
<pre><code>www.linkedin.com.   195
realtime.www.linkedin.com.  38
</code></pre>
<p>On OpenBSD, there were:</p>
<pre><code>www.linkedin.com.   419
play.google.com.    96
realtime.www.linkedin.com.  78
media-exp1.licdn.com.   2
static-exp3.licdn.com.  2
</code></pre>
<h2>Thunderbird</h2>
<p>We see that on W10 thunderbord is checking more frequently the mail's server. Maybe due to a parameter<br>
In both cases, it reports some data to mozilla. </p>
<pre><code>blocklists.settings.services.mozilla.com.   4
firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com.  4
prod.balrog.prod.cloudops.mozgcp.net.   4
aus.thunderbird.net.    2
</code></pre>
<h2>Microsoft</h2>
<p>As expected, W10 is connecting a lot with microsoft servers. I don't know what are those sites. I list some of them here under:</p>
<pre><code>v10.events.data.microsoft.com.  140
settings-win.data.microsoft.com.    106
spclient.wg.spotify.com.    91
tile-service.weather.microsoft.com. 91
ctldl.windowsupdate.com.    68
notifications.4team.biz.    45
watson.telemetry.microsoft.com. 45
ws.4team.biz.   45
arc.msn.com.    37
ris.api.iris.microsoft.com. 32
login.live.com. 16
tsfe.trafficshaping.dsp.mp.microsoft.com.   15
v20.events.data.microsoft.com.  15
www.bing.com.   15
fe3cr.delivery.mp.microsoft.com.    13
slscr.update.microsoft.com. 10
</code></pre>

<p>Like expected W10 is connecting to several unsolicited servers. <br>
This is not a new info, but at least, in my specific case, I have a better idea on which servers. </p>
<p>With OpenBSD no bad surprises, it does what we expect. </p>

<p><strong>When you join two videos or images, it is pleasing to the eye to use a crossfade, or dissolve, or a wipe-effect at the point of transition. You don’t need any expensive software to do this – all you need is FFmpeg and an understanding of the <code>xfade</code> filter to add an eye-catching crossfade, dissolve, or any other transition effect to your videos. </strong></p>



<p>In this tutorial, let’s take a look at some common transitions to make your videos look amazing! </p>



<h2>How do you add a CrossFade using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>The anatomy of a FFmpeg commandline using the <code>xfade</code> filter is as follows. Let’s look at it one line at a time. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i video1.mp4 \
-i video2.mp4 \
-filter_complex xfade=transition=&lt;FADE_TYPE&gt;:\
duration=&lt;TRANSITION_DURATION_IN_SECONDS&gt;:\
offset=&lt;OFFSET_RELATIVE_TO_FIRST_STREAM_IN_SECONDS&gt; \
outputVideo.mp4
</code></pre>



<ul><li>you need to provide two input videos – the first video appears before the transition and the second one appears after the transition</li><li>then we call upon the <code>xfade</code> filter with the following parameters – <ul><li>&lt;FADE_TYPE&gt; – here, you can choose from a wide range of transitions that the <code>xfade</code> filter supports (fade, dissolve, wipeleft, wiperight, etc.)</li><li>&lt;TRANSITION_DURATION_IN_SECONDS&gt; – here, you specify how long you want the transition to last</li><li>&lt;OFFSET_RELATIVE_TO_FIRST_STREAM_IN_SECONDS&gt; – here, you can specify (in seconds)after how many seconds you want the transition to begin relative to the first video</li></ul></li><li>finally, you specify the output video. Note, that you can also provide encoding parameters here. In the absence of any encoding parameters, FFmpeg will default to <code>crf = 23</code> with <code>libx264</code>.</li></ul>



<p>In the following sections, let’s take a look at almost all the transitions that are available in FFmpeg’s <code>xfade</code> filter. I have taken two video clips – CrowdRun and Parkjoy and I’ll be concatenating them using a different transition each time. </p>



<p>To make things easier, I’ve created a video for each transition and attached it here. YouTube might experience some buffering issues and start-up delay – please wait a couple of seconds and it will improve.  </p>



<p>Okay, let’s get started.  </p>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>I get asked a lot about learning languages, so I have a few comments about it here.
Hopefully I can awaken you from some dogmatic slumbers about language.</p>

<h2>Vocabulary is the least important part of learning a language.</h2>

<p>
This is hard for people to understand because I think most monolingual people think that languages are just different word lists that people use.
As a result, 101 students will manually look up every word in the dictionary to translate.
This actually increases the mental load of learning a language because people have the idea that to speak it, they have to think of something in English, then translate the sentence word by word, then say that.
What a pain.
</p>

<p>
So what is a language if not words?
It really is a set of constraints as to how words can go together: what order they go in when modifying each other,
but also languages are morphology.
Verb endings and tenses and such are literally the most important part of a sentence.
If you don't have a productive and reflexive use of verbs, you are literally just going to be reciting nouns you know like a monkey.
</p>

<p>
This is actually why I recommend people learning Romance languages or German to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/michel-thomas.html">use Michel Thomas's audio</a>.
Thomas doesn't lecture at all about what he's doing, but he focused only on using verbs and building up basic expressions from the bottom up until it's understood reflexively by students.
To actually learn any language, this is more or less what you are going to have to mentally do anyway in the process.
</p>

<p>
<strong>I would say it's actually possible to fluently speak a language knowing only about 50 words.</strong>
If you understand the "grammar" of a language, you can basically get by anywhere anytime with a couple dozen words only.
What words you don't know can easily be figured out, but you <em>can't</em> wing it with grammar and you <em>can't</em> wing it with morphology.
</p>

<h3>Computer metaphor</h3>

<p>
Granted, the same is true of programming "languages" as well, weirdly enough.
No one would think "knowing a [computing] language" means just knowing all the function and variable names.
The important thing is knowing the syntax of how you put functions (loosely verbs) and variables (loosely nouns) together.
After all, variable names are always different and functions can be easily invented too or called from some obscure library.
Someone who knows a language is someone who can use its syntax to produce novel expressions.
If you take a Python script, replace its functions with C functions, it's still Python, just calling a bunch of undefined functions.
People can only get away with even sort of believing this in the domain of human languages if you just don't know enough and end up assuming that all languages just work the same.
</p>

<h2>Then what is a language?</h2>

<p>
So really when you learn a language, you can't look at it as new words, but new patterns of speech that interconnect in a logical way.
</p>

<p>
Speaking fluently in that language means being able to use and combine its basic constructions into complex thoughts put in words.
This is why I'm really against "translating in your head."
If you're doing that, you're not actually using the language.
You're teaching yourself a silly English-word-replacement game.
I know it's very hard for word-thinkers not to think in words, but if you can't stop doing that for a second, you're not going to be able to learn a new language.
</p>

<h2>You will not learn a language by consoooming media.</h2>

<p>There's this lazy idea that somehow if you passively sit around and watch people using a language this will somehow endow you with the ability to flexibly produce a language in the same way you see others using it.
People want to believe it because they want to be able to watch TV or play a cell phone game like Duolinguo or valueless Rosetta Stone-like software and somehow gain competence in a language.
</p>

<p>
It's not going to happen ever.
<strong>Learning to play a boring computer game using words from a different languages is not the same as learning to speak the language.</strong>
</p>

<p>
You might say of "just listening to speech" that "that's what children do," but that's not true at all.
Children try pretty hard to participate and understand conversation.
They sometimes have a desperate personal need to understand each passing sentence and hear the language they are trying to learn for hours a day for years.
You watching some forgettable movie in the background as you play with your phone don't.
</p>

<h2>Are you actually thinking?</h2>

<p>If you want to know if you are actually learning a language, ask yourself that.
People are weirdly afraid against actually thinking through things and making new expressions in other languages when that's exactly how you learn them.
</p>

<p>A lot of language nerds love to email me about their Anki cards or their harebrained schemes for mass-memorizing words as if they're an Asian studying for a chemistry test.
Given what I've said about "learning words," you can guess my opinion on that.
Once people abandon the lazy route, sometimes they take up the <i>via dolorosa</i>: the route of suffering and assume that training themselves like a Pavlovian dog will help them become fluent in a language.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the only question that matter is: "Are you actually thinking?"
Are you actually going through the mental process of creating new sentences in a new language?
</p>

<p>
When I was learning Latin obviously I had no Latin-speaking friends and could barely get my hands on anything Latin-related.
But after I learned the basics of the language I started thinking in it constantly.
First that starts in my always implicitly translating English song lyrics or ads in my head into Latin.
That's actually difficult if you're dealing with something modern and idiomatic.
Not as bad with church songs.
As time goes on, I would overtly remember things in Latin sentences instead of English.
If I mumbled something under my breath I would make sure it was Latin.
At all points in time, I was thinking about how the language was structured and what it meant to produce sentences in it.
</p>

<p>
The sad fact is that most people who "learn" languages in school treat them as advanced cross-word puzzle like games where they don't <em>actually think</em> in the language, but have hilarious mnemonic devices in their head for relating what they want to say in English with something in the language they're learning.
</p>

<h2>Translating is a bad habit.</h2>

<p>
If anything, you should become <em>worse</em> at translating the further you go on and the more independently you can stand on your own in another language.
</p>

<p>
Latin is a good example.
I can read and comprehend Latin very well, but if asked to translate what I'm reading, I find that more and more difficult the better I read Latin.
Now it's easy for me to report the meaning of a passage, but phrase-by-phrase translation is something you have to think through because Latin and English are structurally very different.
This isn't just word order, but even how a Latin speaker approaches expressions and the kinds of phrases they use can translate only very delicately into English.
</p>

<p>
The problem nearly doesn't exist between English and Spanish, which are basically the same language.
I'm sure someone who only knows Spanish will feel like English and Spanish have many differences, but in the context of other languages, like Latin or Chinese or Japanese, it's hard not to view English and Spanish as having basically the same kind of syntax 95% of the time.
That actually goes for most modern European languages.
</p>

<h2>You sound stupid if you don't sound stupid.</h2>

<p>
Every language has its own set of phonological rules that determine what particular sounds are said how and where.
Phonological rules give us "our accents."
When someone speaks English in an accent, they are really just speaking English using the phonological constraints of whatever language they're more familiar with.
If they speak English competently, there's at least some extent to which they are abandoning their native phonological rules.
</p>

<p>
When you first start learning a language, you might read something aloud and say "I sound stupid."
This is because your natural way of speaking is obviously to say everything with an accent consistent with English.
You can probably remember the apathetic jock in Spanish class or whatever who religiously pronounced every Spanish word he mindlessly read with an almost intentionally non-Spanish accent.
</p>

<p>
To actually speak another language is to adopt the phonological tendencies and even the prosodic and tonal traits of that language.
When you initially do that, you will probably sound very stupid to yourself since violating phonological rules you're familiar with always sounds wrong.
If you do overcome that illusion of felt stupidity, you <em>won't</em> sound stupid when it counts.
If you refuse to improve your accent <em>immediately and from the beginning</em> you will sound like an utter moron forever.
</p>

<p>
There's actually a trick too: when you imitate a foreign accent, you are actually implicitly adopting the phonological rules of their language that you have noticed in real life.
My suggestion is when you are starting out, <em>read the other language in what you'd guess would be a stereotypical accent of the person speaking the language</em>.
If your imitation is good, you're speaking their language without an accent.

<h2>"The Critical Period" is fake.</h2>

<p>
That reminds me.

<p>
There's an idea in academic and clinical linguistics as well as popular culture that children have a magical plasticy of the brain that makes them uniquely good at learning languages.
This is supposed to be the reason why children learn languages "fast" and adults don't.
<strong>I think this is a myth.</strong>
You don't have to send me all the "proof" about this (don't worry, the Universities of Georgia and Arizona would've failed me totally if I hadn't seen it for my linguistics degrees there).
I sort of assumed that this was true for years, but on further thought, I think it's just a conspiracy of irrelevant data and copes...
or at least, it's not nearly as …</p></div>

    <p>There have been a lot of books that have influenced my career: Fred Turner’s <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,</em> Karl Marx’s <em>Grundrisse,</em> John Law’s <em>Aircraft Stories,</em> and Patricia Hill Collin’s <em>Black Feminist Thought.</em> These works are a kind of well to return to, again and again, to quench intellectual thirsts: thinking historically about communication technologies, and thinking about heterogeneity in the cultures of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the closest to my heart, one of the books that came along at just the right moment in my career – a bubbling spring of the well – is Scott Rosenberg’s <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Dreaming in Code</em> tells the story of the development of <a href="https://www.chandlerproject.org/">Chandler</a>, an open source, cross-platform “personal information manager.” This software was the brainchild of Mitch Kapor (of Lotus 1-2-3 fame, and the founder of a short-lived non-profit called the <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications Foundation</a>. While the OSAF was well-funded (to the tune of millions), and while Chandler was eventually built, it was marked by blown deadlines and cost overruns. And the project is now moribund.</p>

<p>In other words, as Rosenberg wryly notes, Chandler is another in a long line of failed software projects. Unlike building bridges, he notes, software engineering is <em>hard.</em></p>

<p>So, this is not a <strong>Goal 1</strong> post, because the software at the center of <em>Dreaming In Code</em> is no longer available. Yes, <a href="https://www.chandlerproject.org/">the website is still live</a>. Yes, the project did get far enough along to be useable. Maybe it could still be used if the code could be put into a container (Snap, Flatpak) – then, it could run in a modern Linux installation. If so, perhaps it could contribute to the #fald (FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream).</p>

<p>Then again, I’m not sure I would want such old software handling my email and calendars without the latest encryption. The last time I got Chandler to work was around Ubuntu 16.04 (though I may be wrong about the date), and I remember being underwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why the project failed. Perhaps Chandler failed because it didn’t adhere to the <strong>Unix Philosophy</strong> (a decidedly <strong>Goal 2</strong> topic) – it did not do just one thing and do it well, but <a href="https://www.chandlerproject.org/vision/">tried to do lots of things</a> and thus did them poorly. Indeed, Rosenberg cites Linus Torvalds, who argues that open source production is best done with small goals.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it was too centralized and did not attract a big enough base of contributors. Kapor reportedly threw a lot of money at Chandler, and part of his reasoning was to have his developers largely on-site in San Francisco. The project did not attract, as far as I can tell, a large base of contributors around world. (Indeed, if it had, perhaps we’d be on version 5.0 at this point).</p>

<p>In the end, Chandler has faded out of consciousness, replaced by a whole host of other “PIMs”. The features it largely offers are replicated by email clients – not to mention the monstrosity that is Google.</p>

<p>But tracing the failure of one relatively obscure FOSS project is not the real payoff of the book for me. <em>Dreaming In Code</em> is important to me in a <strong>Goal 2</strong> way because it started me out on the path of what I came to recognize as <strong>software studies.</strong>  Although it’s not an academic book – Rosenberg is a journalist and founder of <em>Salon.com</em> – the book is deep and exceptionally well researched. Academics have cited it – including luminaries like Rob Kitchin, Judy Wacjman, and Tim Jordan. Rosenberg’s research is excellent. His endnotes are <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/endnotes/">still online</a> – it’s a wealth of what might be called “classic software studies” citations.</p>

<p>He draws on Donald Knuth, Fred Brooks, Eric Raymond, Martin Campbell-Kelly, Vannevar Bush, Doug Englebart, Ellen Ullman, and many, many more. By tracing these citations, I could get a good grasp on the history of software engineering. Perhaps the most influential citation Rosenberg draws on is the late 1960s NATO conferences on software engineering. Along with Sarah Bell, I myself drew on that conference to write about <a href="http://computationalculture.net/heterogeneous-software-engineering-garmisch-1968-microsoft-vista-and-a-methodology-for-software-studies/">the engineering of Microsoft Vista as a form of “heterogeneous engineering”</a>.</p>

<p>But there’s more than just a wealth of citations. Rosenberg embedded himself with the Chandler team, watching their struggles and connecting those struggles to the history of software engineering. The chapters often start with an episode in the development of Chandler – say, a debate over which programming language to use – which is followed by a deep dive into the history and politics of programming languages. At times, readers might find these too much of a diversion from the story of Chandler. Indeed, Rosenberg’s next book, <em>Say Everything,</em> tends to avoid these sojourns. But I really, really dig them. The discussion of the NATO conference, for example, was just a great bit of history that prompted me to go and learn more about it.</p>

<p>In addition to placing Chandler into a larger historical context, Rosenberg is also a compassionate, but critical, student of the history of Chandler. It’s a model of analysis of the people and technologies that go into software engineering, told in a beautiful narrative style that I would aspire to myself, and again, the citations are rich.</p>

<p>I find myself returning to <em>Dreaming in Code</em> again, and again, over the years. The first time I read it, in fact, I was so enthralled that I was nose-deep in it while my partner was giving birth to our son (at one point, she knocked the book out of my hands and said, “no more reading!”). I remember this in part because my Zotero note is dated the day before my son’s birth. As I set off on a new project – my <strong>Goal 2</strong> project – I have decided to return to <em>Dreaming In Code.</em> And I find myself at the well, again, and it is definitely not dry.</p>

        <p>I like using RSS, I have <a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> running in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail">FreeBSD Jail</a> all the time. Lately I noticed that it’s not very handy to open up Flickr every hour to see photos by my friends, so I decided to use their RSS feed.</p>
<p>First of all, I’m so happy that Flickr provides an RSS feed, it’s an amazing standard and I wish more websites and services implemented it, or at least, not remove it :-)</p>
<p>So I go to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/norayr_chilingarian/">Norayr’s Flickr page</a>, and since Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1477667">removed RSS</a> I do Ctrl-U to see the page source. I search for the term <code>RSS</code> and I find nothing, I search for <code>atom</code> and I find a link!</p>
<p>I copy the link and I add it to my Miniflux feeds. I hit refresh and I see the following.</p>
<p><img src="https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/img/Flickr_Uploads_from_everyone.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Okay, so looks like those are photos… from everyone… on Flickr… from the future.</p>
<p>I <strong>KNOW</strong> that my time is synced, because I always have NTP running. After some digging, I figured that those posts ARE from the future. Flickr calls them “scheduled” posts.</p>
<p>Doing a little more digging, and I realize that I did not copy the full link with <code>id=norayr's_id</code> and now I’m seeing everyone’s feeds.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

<div><div><div><div><div>
                    <p>In this post, we delve into the performance implications of memory by looking into humble int
                        arrays.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are quite a few numerical types in Java. Most of them comes in pairs: short/Short,
                        int/Integer, long/Long. In this post we'll look at the int/Integer pair.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>On ints and Integers</h2>
                    <p>So, what is the difference between an int and an Integer, apart from the latter being able to
                        brag about having a capital 'I'? You probably know that int is a primitive, and that Integer is
                        an Object. It thus follows that Integer references can be null, and that Integers can be used as
                        generics in e.g. collections such as List.
                    </p>
                    <p>Integers are much more convenient to use. So, why does Java even have ints? After all, Ruby gets
                        away with doing just that. The answer is <b>performance</b>. Java can, contrary to what angry
                        c++ programmers might tell you, be used to write fairly fast programmes.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Benchmarking</h2>
                    <p>To look into this a bit more, let's forget all about maths in this example conceived to make a
                        point. We have a pair of programs that creates an array of integers and sums it up.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>Initialize and sum using int[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code><span>int</span> count = <span>10_000_000</span>;
<span>int</span>[] ints = <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
  ints[i] = i;
}
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i : ints) {
  sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <div><p>Initialize and sum using Integer[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code><span>int</span> count = <span>10_000_000</span>;
Integer[] integers = <span>new</span> Integer[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
    integers[i] = <span>new</span> Integer(i);
}
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (Integer i : integers) {
    sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <p>On my laptop, the int[] version averages <b>17.91 ms</b> per round. The Integer[] version
                        averages <b>364.47 ms</b> per round. Thus, the Integer[] version is about <b>20x</b> slower.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, why is that? Since the Integer[] allocates 1 000 001 objects per round, the Garbage
                        Collector has to work very very hard. In this case I used the G1 collector, which according to
                        the GC logs spent 170% of the wallclock time in pauses. Allocating and garbage collecting
                        objects is expensive. The int[] version allocated 1 object, the int[] array.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, what happens if we only sum the integers? In this example, the arrays are already created.
                        This <em>should</em> us benchmark something else than the Garbage Collector.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>Sum using int[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code>
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i : ints) {
  sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <div><p>Sum using Integer[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code>
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (Integer i : integers) {
    sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <p>The Integer[] version now averages <b>23.86 ms</b> per round. Great improvement! But the int[]
                        version now averages <b>5.19 ms</b> per round. About 4x faster.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Memory sizes</h2>
                    <p>So, why is the int[] version faster now? After all, adding two integers is a single CPU
                        instruction. The answer is memory usage. We can use
                        <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jol/">JOL</a> to see how much memory the
                        different versions use:
                    </p>
                    <div>
    
  <pre><code>

<span>int</span> count = <span>10_000_000</span>;
Integer[] integers = <span>new</span> Integer[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
    integers[i] = <span>new</span> Integer(i);
}
<span>int</span>[] ints = <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
    ints[i] = i;
}
System.out.printf(
        <span>"Ints size: %d, Integer[] size: %d%n"</span>,
        GraphLayout.parseInstance(ints).totalSize(),
        GraphLayout.parseInstance(integers).totalSize()
);
</code></pre>

</div>
                    <p>The int[] uses 40 000 016 bytes, while the Integer[] uses 200 000 016. For both arrays, the
                        array object header uses 16 bytes. In the int[] case, we then use 4 bytes per value. For the
                        Integer[], we use 4 bytes per Integer reference/pointer in the array. This could be higher
                        depending on whether or not <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-compressed-oops">compressed OOPs</a> can be used. Finally, 16 bytes are used per Integer object.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Integer[] case thus needs to read ~5 times as much memory. This is important, since
                        <b>reading from memory is much,
                            <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers">much</a> slower</b> than executing an add
                        instruction. In fact, most of the time spent in our second benchmark is spent reading from
                        memory. The 5x memory reading increase is very close to the 4x speed decrease.
                    </p>
                    <p>CPU Caches tries to make reading memory faster. However, since both the int[] and Integer[]
                        examples allocated more memory than the 4 MB L3 cache of my laptop processor, caching likely had
                        limited effects in this example.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interestingly, most profilers can't tell the difference between the CPU executing instructions
                        and the the CPU reading from memory. Thus, even when tooling reports 100% CPU usage, your
                        bottleneck can be memory usage.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Is this real?</h2>
                    <p>Needless to say, these examples are contrived. But the costs are real. Object allocation and
                        memory access affects the performance of real-world software. When I work with performance, I
                        tend to focus on memory usage and allocations first.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the game industry
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">data oriented design</a> is used
                        to improve performance. The main idea is to optimize data structures to better utilize CPU
                        caches and reduce the amount of memory read. I.e, addressing the issues we saw in our
                        benchmarks. There is nothing limiting the techniques of data oriented design to game
                        development, it can be used in any application.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data oriented design does not have to be an all-or-nothing thing. Reducing memory allocations
                        and optimizing your data layout to improve the cache hit rate can be done gradually, and should
                        be applied in the parts of the application where it is needed the most.

                <div><h2>How to reduce memory usage</h2>
                    <p>The first step to reduce memory usage is to profile allocations - if you don't know which part
                        of your programme is allocating memory you do not know what parts to improve. Pre-maturely
                        optimizing the wrong thing is.. bad. <a href="https://blunders.io/">Blunders</a> is a profiler, but there are
                        many others. Use one that can tell you about memory allocations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you know which parts is slow, try changing the algorithm to use less memory. Sometimes
                        that's as simple as removing a log statement, sometimes it requires rewriting significant
                        parts of the software.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you have a lot of collections with primitives, look into using
                        <a href="http://fastutil.di.unimi.it/">fastutil</a> or similar to reduce memory usage.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>In this post, we have used a toy example to show just how much effect object allocation and
                        memory size can have on performance.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Once we have tokenized some program text, we need to check whether the tokens are in the correct sequence. For example, which of the following token
sequences are valid?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tokenization of “32 + 4”: “&lt;number, 32&gt;, &lt;+, +&gt;, &lt;number, 4&gt;”.</li>
  <li>Tokenization of “+ 32 4”: “&lt;+, +&gt;, &lt;number, 32&gt;, &lt;number, 4&gt;”.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regular expressions are not powerful enough to make the choices like these.  The rules about which token sequences are valid constitute the
<em>syntax</em> of a programming language. In this article, we will develop the concepts and techniques of checking syntactic correctness of a program
text.</p>

<p>We will assume that the program text is already tokenized. Thus, our input is going to be a sequence of tokens. The tokens we will be
dealing with in this article are as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The token “number” represents positive integers.</li>
  <li>The token “id” represents identifiers.</li>
  <li>The symbols “+”, “-“, “*”, “/”, “=”, “==”, “)”, and “(“ represent themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some examples of raw inputs along with their tokenized represenations.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Raw input</th>
      <th scope="col">Tokenized representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>"123 + 13132"</td>
      <td>number + number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"123 * 234 + 12"</td>
      <td>"number * number + number"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"(978 * 13) / (123 - 12)"</td>
      <td>"(number * number) / (number - number)"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For brevity, we will call a sequence of tokens a <em>string</em>.</p>

<h2 id="context-free-grammars">Context-free grammars</h2>
<p>We need a way to represent programming language syntax. Let’s start with a simple example. Suppose we want to represent those
arithmetic expressions where two positive integers are separated by a “+” sign. We can represent this idea using the following notation.</p><p>

\[expr \rightarrow \underline{number} \underline{+} \underline{number}\]

</p><p>This is an example of a <em>production</em>. There are two parts separated by an arrow. The symbol “expr” on the left of the arrow is the <em>head</em>
of this production. The symbols “number”, “+”, and “number” on the right are collectively the <em>body</em> of this production. The underlined symbols
appear in the input and are called the <em>terminals</em>. Symbols that are not terminals are called the <em>non terminals</em>.</p>

<p>Only “number + number” conforms to the above production. To represent “number + number + number”, we need to write a new production.</p><p>

\[expr \rightarrow \underline{number} + \underline{number} + \underline{number}\]

</p><p>What if we want to represent an unbounded number of “number” tokens separated by “+” signs? The phrase “an unbounded number” suggests induction.
We need atleast two productions to represent an inductive definition.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number} \\
  expr &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>In the above set of productions, the second production is the basis case and the first production is the inductive case. Before we can use this
set of productions to represent something like “number + number + number”, we need to define a new concept.</p>

<p>In a set of productions, if we designate a non terminal as a <em>start symbol</em>, we have a context-free grammar.</p>

<div>
  <p>Definition 1: Context-Free Grammar</p>
  <p>A context free grammar is a 4-tuple \(\{V, \Sigma, P, S\}\) where:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>\(V\) is a set of non terminals.</li>
    <li>\(\Sigma\) is a set of terminals.</li>
    <li>\(P\) is a set of productions.</li>
    <li>\(S\) is a non terminal designated as a start symbol.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>We can thus use our above pair of productions to create a context-free grammar.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number} \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>In the above grammar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(V = \{expr\}\),</li>
  <li>\(\Sigma = \{number, +\}\),</li>
  <li>\(P\) is the set of productions, and</li>
  <li>\(S = expr\).</li>
</ol>

<p>A string is a member of a grammar if it can be <em>derived</em> using that grammar. Let us derive “number + number + number” using our addition grammar. We start
with the start symbol.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>
    We <i>apply a production</i> by replacing a non terminal with its body. So the application of
    \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number}\) is this.
  </p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>On that \(expr\) in the string, we apply the same production \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number}\).</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr + number + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Finally, we apply \(expr \rightarrow \underline{number}\) on the \(expr\) in the last string. The result is the string we wanted to derive.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  number + number + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><div>
  <p>Definition 2: Derivation</p>
  <p>The sequence of steps taken by a grammar to produce a string starting from the start symbol of the grammar is called a derivation.</p>
</div>

<p>The above derivation of “number + number + number” is this.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  &amp; expr \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number + number \\
  \implies &amp; number + number + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Context-free grammars describe languages. The langauges defined by context-free grammars are called <em>context-free languages</em>.</p>

<p>
    One unknown in the above derivation is the choice of production to apply at each step. How did we know that we should apply
    \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number}\) on all but the last step and \(expr \rightarrow \underline{number}\) on the last step?
    This problem is central to syntax checking and we will address it over the course of the remaining article.
  </p>

<p>With context-free grammars, we have a notation to represent the syntactic elements of a programming language.</p>

<h2 id="reductions">Reductions</h2>
<p>In syntax checking, we are given a grammar and a string and we want to check whether the string is in the language of that grammar. We need to find the
derivation of that string using the grammar.</p>

<p>A more convinient way to look into this problem is to look at derivations in reverse. The above derivation of “number + number + number” in reverse
looks like this.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  &amp; number + number + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>We are finding instances of production bodies in the string and replacing them with production heads. This process of replacing an instance of a
production body with a production head is called <em>reduction</em>. Reduction is the opposite of the application of a production. We can now
state the condition under which a string belongs to a context-free language.</p>

<div>
  <p>Definition 4: Criterion for a string to be derivable from a grammar</p>
  <p>
    A string can be derived from a grammar if we can reduce it to the start symbol of that grammar.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="extending-context-free-grammars">Extending context-free grammars</h2>
<p>The addition grammar is contrived. Because of that, we have not uncovered the full complexity of derivations and reductions.
Before moving further, we should learn about extending context-free grammars.</p>

<p>Context-free grammars are defined inductively. Thus, we can extend a context-free grammar by adding more inductive cases as productions.
Let’s try to extend our arithemtic grammar. Right now, it can only handle the “+” operator.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number} \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>We now want to add support for the “*” operator. We can do that by adding more productions to our addition grammar.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition and multiplication grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow term \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \underline{*} \underline{number} \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>
    We replaced the terminal \(number\) in our addition grammar by a new non terminal \(term\) and added basis and inductive productions for \(term\).
  </p>

<p>One way to add more induction cases is to introduce new non terminals. This is what led us from addition grammar to addition and multiplication grammar.
Let us look at another example. If we want to handle parenthesized expressions like “(123 + 12) * 3”, we can extend our addition and multiplication grammar
like this.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition and multiplication with parenthesis</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow term \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \underline{*} f\!actor \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow f\!actor \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number} \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{(} expr \underline{)}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>
    We replaced \(\underline{number}\) in addition and multiplication grammar by a new non terminal \(f\!actor\) and added two new productions
    for \(f\!actor\). The production \(f\!actor \rightarrow \underline{number}\) is the basis case and \(f\!actor \rightarrow (expr)\) is the
    inductive case.
  </p>

<p>We can add inductive cases to our grammar without introducing new non terminals by changing the way non terminals are arranged in production bodies.
Let us extend our grammar to handle “" and “-“ operators.</p>

<div>
  <p>Complete arithmetic grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{-} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow term \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \underline{*} f\!actor \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \space \underline{/} \space f\!actor \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow f\!actor \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number} \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{(} expr \underline{)}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>
    That is, we added two new productions, \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{-} term\) and \(term \rightarrow term \space \underline{/} \space f\!actor\)
    without changing anything else.
  </p>

<p>The complete arithmetic grammar is realistic enough for us to elucidate points we would otherwise have missed had we continued with our
original addition grammar.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-reductions">Implementing reductions</h2>
<p>Let us go back to the problem of implementing reductions. The implementations of reductions, and of grammars, are called parsers. The process of
reducing a string of tokens to the start …</p></div></div></div></div>

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy announced its intention to offer $400M of debt to investors, and a plan to purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds.</p><p>This was the 4th time MicroStrategy announced plans to buy Bitcoin, but for the first time, the market had a strong negative reaction to MicroStrategy's announcement.</p><p>On December 8th, Microstrategy's stock was down by 14%, their largest single-day decline since March 18th.</p><p>Why the negative reaction? Because this time the Bitcoin would be bought with other people's money, instead of the cash reserves already on MicroStrategy's balance sheet.</p><p>Despite the negative reaction, this bet makes a ton of sense.</p><p>MicroStrategy is a business generating tens of millions of dollars in annual cash flow from operations, they've got almost no long-term debt, and they have access to some of the cheapest capital in the world.</p><p>They also have an ongoing Bitcoin bet that has returned over 50% in a few months, and this offering gives them an opportunity to almost double the stakes.</p><p>Let's break down the potential upside and downside of MicroStrategy's latest debt offering.</p><h2>Microstrategy's Debt Offering</h2><p>First, let's look at the type of debt MicroStrategy offered investors.</p><p>They offered "unsecured senior convertible notes", a quick break-down of the term is below.</p><p><strong>Unsecured:</strong> Microstrategy is not giving investors ownership of any assets as collateral. For investors, this obviously comes with a higher risk than debt secured by some underlying asset like real estate or equipment.</p><p><strong>Convertible:</strong> Microstrategy can convert this debt into shares of Microstrategy or cash. The equity conversion rate for the notes will be 2.5126 shares of MicroStrategy per $1,000 of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $397.99 per share. Microstrategy currently trades for less, so this strategy only makes sense when the stock value rises above $398.</p><p><strong>Senior:</strong> If Microstrategy defaults on its debt, company assets are paid out to creditors in priority sequence.</p><p>Secured debt is paid off first, then unsecured debt, and then finally the equity shareholders get whatever is left (if anything). Within each priority level, there are sub-levels of priority. Senior secured debt is paid back before junior secured debt, senior notes are paid off before junior notes, and preferred stock is paid off before common stock.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> A particular kind of corporate debt, typically with a maturity period of 10 years or less.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Debt Offering Timeline</h3><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy's intention was to offer:</p><ul role="list"><li>$400M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $60M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 9th, MicroStrategy officially priced their offering at:</p><ul role="list"><li>$550M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025, with a semi-annual interest payment at 0.75% APY</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $100M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 11th, MicroStrategy closed the round of fundraising, and sold the extra $100 million option too. As a result, their net proceeds were $634.9 million after fees.</p><p>And with that money, they plan to buy more Bitcoin - since they've already converted 100% of their cash and short-term investments into Bitcoin.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Bet In A Nutshell</h3><p>Here's what this entire bet boils down to.</p><p>MicroStrategy must pay $4.9M in each of the next five years as interest on their debt offering. That adds up to $24.4M in interest payments, plus a lump sum payment of the $650M original debt offering in December 2025.</p><p>That's a grand total of $674.4M paid off over the course of 5 years.</p><p>But there's a bonus option for MicroStrategy. If their Bitcoin bet pays off and they want to de-leverage, or if their stock price rises above $400, they have the option to convert some or all of the debt into equity or cash.</p><p>From the $650M offering, MicroStrategy expects to keep $634.9M that they can invest in Bitcoin. The other $15.1 million goes towards various fees and commissions.</p><p>Therefore, to turn their $634.9M into $674.4M, they'll just need a 1.2% annual return on their Bitcoin investment. </p><p>In other words, assuming MicroStrategy acquires Bitcoin around $18,750 per coin, they'll have paid for all 5 years of interest payments once Bitcoin hits $19,916 per coin. Anything above that is all profit.</p><h2>MicroStrategy's Upside Potential</h2><h3>How Much Could MicroStrategy Make?</h3><p>MicroStrategy has made 3 prior Bitcoin purchases.</p><ul role="list"><li>They're up $152M (61%) on their $250M August investment</li><li>They're up $140M (80%) on their $175M September investment</li><li>They're roughly even on their $50M December investment (made last week).</li></ul><p>All together, their $475M of cash is now worth $765M (up 61%) in just a few months.</p><p>With this $634.9M of cash from investors, they can buy just under 35,000 more coins. Since they already have 40,824 BTC, they will likely hold over 75,000 BTC by the end of December.</p><h3>How Much Higher Might Bitcoin Go?</h3><p>Obviously this is unknowable, and no prediction will be perfect when we look back five years from now. Still, there are enough influential figures in finance who have put out Bitcoin price predictions that it would be unwise to ignore them completely.</p><p>In addition, these people have all been successful capital allocators outside of the Bitcoin world, so their stance on Bitcoin as an asset class is less biased than the price predictions one might find on Bitcoin Twitter. They don't need Bitcoin to succeed, but they still think it will.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwHI6OC3rc8">Raoul Pal</a>: $1M per coin in the next five years</p><p><a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/the-case-for-500k-bitcoin/">Winklevoss Twins</a>: $500k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/classicmacro/status/1327381449000034307">Citibank Analyst Tom Fitzpatrick</a>: A move as high as $318k per coin by December 2021</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/12/social-capitals-palihapitiya-says-bitcoin-is-going-to-1-million-in-the-next-20-years.html">Chamath Palihapitiya [in 2017]</a>: Probably 100k per coin in the next 3-4 years, and I think it is in the next 20 years, $1M per coin</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1328492371353489408">Mike Novogratz</a>: Going to 65k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p>I'm sure I've missed a handful of price predictions, but you get the point.</p><p>On the high end, if Bitcoin gets to $1M/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $75B by 2025.</p><p>On the low end, if Bitcoin gets to $65k/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $4.9B by 2025.</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Microstrategy has massive upside potential if Bitcoin's price gets anywhere close to the predictions above. But what if it doesn't?</p><h2>Microstrategy's Downside Risk</h2><h3><strong>What Happens To MicroStrategy If Bitcoin Goes Down?</strong></h3><p>It's possible that Bitcoin's price in December 2025 may be lower than it is today, but it's not very likely. In its 12 year history, Bitcoin has never traded down over a five year period, and it's not even close. 5 years ago, it was trading for $436. It is now trading for $18,750.</p><p>That's a 42x gain since December 12, 2015.</p><p>Still, the past isn't always a good predictor of the future, so let's explore MicroStrategy's options if Bitcoin does have a negative 5 year return.</p><p>Microstrategy has a profitable business generating tens of millions of dollars in operating cash flow each year. In fact, from 2016-2019 they've averaged $65M of cash flow from operations per year.</p><p>That's plenty of safety margin to take care of their $4.12 million annual interest payment, assuming zero business growth and zero inflation. If either one is positive, it will be even easier to meet their interest payment obligations.</p><h3>What Happens If Bitcoin And MicroStrategy Go Down?</h3><p>Ok, but what happens if Microstrategy's business doesn't generate any cash in the next five years, and the price of Bitcoin is lower in 2025?</p><p>Even more unlikely considering MicroStrategy's track record of success dates back to 1989, but let's entertain the possibility. What can MicroStrategy do about a rough spell for both Bitcoin and their business?</p><p>First, they could issue more debt.</p><p>MicroStrategy's largest long-term liability is its office space, and otherwise the company carries almost no long-term debt on their balance sheet.</p><p>At a time when central banks are relentlessly printing money, and bond yields are basically zero, raising another round of low-interest capital in the future won't be a challenge.</p><p>Second, a remote-first future means they may not even have to raise more money.</p><p>Prior to 2020, Michael Saylor strongly believed in-person work was important for MicroStrategy's success, but the global lockdown in the spring changed his mind.</p><p>If MicroStrategy does pursue a long-term remote work approach, that eliminates their largest long-term liability. As their $100M of lease obligations for office space gradually expires, the extra money can help fund their debt interest payments. It's not a big enough saving to pay off their debt principal, but it gives them extra time to either raise more capital or improve their business cash flows.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>MicroStrategy investors didn't run the numbers when they heard of this debt offering announcement last week, they panicked.</p><p>Microstrategy is a well-run, capital efficient business that took advantage of low interest rates to protect their purchasing power. While their Bitcoin allocation is aggressive by Wall Street standards, it's nothing that might risk the future of their software business.</p><p>And if it works out, it will be remembered as a bold (and very successful) bet that permanently shifted the way Wall Street thinks about Bitcoin.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I recently bought a stud finder from Amazon based on it having the “Amazon’s Choice” tag – a reliable shortcut, right? Then the product arrived.</p>



<p>What struck me as initially weird about this product was that the instructions were all in an extremely small font – I couldn’t read them without straining my eyes, and there was no website link.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="909" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1024x909.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1024x909.jpg 1024w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-300x266.jpg 300w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-768x682.jpg 768w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1536x1363.jpg 1536w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-2048x1818.jpg 2048w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1200x1065.jpg 1200w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1980x1757.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>So, I searched online for the model number, TH220, but instead found references to another product by “FOLAI” with some poorly made YouTube reviews. That product looked exactly the same, except for the color and labeling. </p>



<p>I went back to the Amazon product page for “The <em><strong>Original </strong></em>Pink Box” stud finder and scanned the reviews (emphasis on “Original” is mine; you’ll understand the irony shortly). It was apparent that the majority of the reviews were for other unrelated products like a tape measure. Then, I noticed something strange in the “Style” selector tool for the stud finder. It appears that a hack was applied to have multiple, unrelated products all linked to this one by using the “style” feature.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="542" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/style-hack.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/style-hack.jpg 580w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/style-hack-300x280.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>These various products were all attributed to this stud finder by Amazon. Thus, the stud finder receives irrelevant reviews by using the “Style” feature. Most of the reviews are for tape measures and screwdrivers. </figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not sure this is a case of “<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/customer-reviews-ratings/hijacked-reviews-on-amazon-can-trick-shoppers/">review hijacking</a>,” since the reviews were presumably for other products by the same company.</p>



<p>I contacted Amazon support to ask what was going on, but support was initially useless: they replied to my inquiry with a <em>description of the product</em>. After further discussion, they assured me about the quality of their inventory and offered that I could return it for a refund, and then gave me a $5 credit.</p>



<p>The instructions themselves – although too small to read comfortably – had reasonably clear English, suggesting a possible American manufacturer. So, I searched for some of the text strings from the manual and found it copied to more clones of this product:</p>



<ul><li>“Shibeier” stud finder on Sears’ website</li><li>“INTEY” stud finder</li><li>“FOLAI”</li><li>“Baqsoo” (also found on Amazon through a search of the manual that revealed some Q&amp;A was using product page keyword stuffing from the manual)</li><li>“TAVOOL”</li><li>“ZBYZF”</li><li>“VIGOELAN”</li><li>(<a href="https://www.sainsmart.com/products/sainsmart-toolpac-sma19-stud-finder-wall-scanner">SainSmart</a> <a href="http://wiki.sainsmart.com/index.php/101-92-512">ToolPac</a> SMA19) – finally – what <em>appears </em>to be the original source of the instruction manual: the same instructions, fewer typos (an artifact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>?), and a different model number cut &amp; pasted.</li></ul>



<p>So, which is the real manufacturer? And which are knockoffs? And when can you trust “Amazon’s Choice?” What does “choice” imply, anyway? It’d seem to imply some editorial review by Amazon, but since Amazon won’t say, it is reasonable to speculate that it is actually an algorithmic semi-sponsored result, in the sense that Amazon strikes some balance between expected profit margin and rating.</p>



<p>What’s a consumer to do? I checked ReviewMeta and Fakespot for reviews, but both had equally failed the test:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="582" height="1024" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade-582x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade-582x1024.png 582w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade-170x300.png 170w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"><figcaption>ReviewMeta trusted nearly all the irrelevant reviews.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Above is ReviewMeta. Below is Fakespot.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="703" height="571" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fakespot-grade.png" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fakespot-grade.png 703w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fakespot-grade-300x244.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px"><figcaption>Fakespot also trusted the bad reviews.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So what exactly is going on? My guess is that “manufacturers” are being invented at an increasing pace in order to flood the search results with listings of the same product, and Amazon is struggling to keep up with the pace.</p>



<p>It seems we’re seeing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/">rise in counterfeits</a> on Amazon. Increasingly, it’s smart to revert back to name brands, <a href="https://brianbien.com/amazons-fake-review-problem/">ignore online reviews</a>, and shop from retailers who do the vetting of products that they sell.</p>



<p>So, did the stud finder work? I’m not sure whether I can trust it to detect wires in the wall, since the results seem strange and filled with a lot of false positives. As a non-expert, I need a name brand for comparison to see if the readings I’m getting are reliable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>The last time we talked about software architecture, I introduced you to<a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/11/22/layered-architecture-what-is-layered-architecture-and-when-to-use-it/"> Layered Architecture</a>. Today we will start with Clean architecture (also called Onion or Ports and adapters architecture) and more specifically domain-driven design.</p>



<p>Clean architecture as a concept is significantly more complex than layered architecture. So I decided to split the article into two parts. In today’s article, I will try to explain the idea behind Domain-driven design simply.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Domain-driven design?</strong></h2>



<p>We need to understand domain-driven design because it lies in the center of Clean architecture (figuratively and literally).</p>



<p>Domain-driven design has its technicalities (that we are going to inspect in detail), but in the first place, DDD is a way of thinking.</p>



<p>As we can see from the name, this design approach is driven by the business domain. Or, said another way, we focus entirely on the business logic of the domain.</p>



<p>Integration and infrastructure features we consider details that the domain model <strong>does not know nor depend on</strong>.</p>



<p>In turn, the business domain can have sub-domains, and these sub-domains are isolated from each other as much as possible.</p>



<p>Let’s provide a simple example. Suppose we have to create an application for a food delivery system using domain-driven design.</p>



<p>The domain here is the entire process of ordering, payment, communication with the restaurant, and delivery and tracking.</p>



<p>And the sub-domains, as we can see, are order management, delivery management, etc.</p>



<p>Using DDD toward the example above should create an encapsulated core consisting of clearly defined business entities with strict boundaries. Don’t get panic. We will explain everything.</p>



<h2><strong>Domain-driven design first steps</strong></h2>



<p>The hardest thing about domain-driven design is building the right logical model of the domain and its sub-domains and defining proper boundaries. That is something that the developers <strong>can’t and should not do alone</strong>.</p>



<p>Developers should work in <strong>very close</strong> collaboration with the business people. Only business people know how exactly they operate their business, and only they can clarify the domain and subdomains to the developers.</p>



<p>At this point, developers <strong>should not</strong> take into consideration any technicalities, any. Their mission is to model the domain and its sub-domains only through the business logic point of view. They don’t think about databases, persistence, representation, other integrations, etc. The models they create are pure objects limited to any external dependencies.</p>



<p>Developers and business people should create a common language for business objects in the system. This common language is called <strong>ubiquitous language</strong>. Behind that fancy word hides the simple goal for common understanding. Terms (this also applies to the code) should be named so anybody can understand them.</p>



<p>Before continue with the main domain-driven design elements, let’s clarify some terms.</p>



<h3><strong>Bounded context</strong></h3>



<p>Bounded context is a pattern whose main idea is to draw boundaries between different sub-domains. We do this because we want each sub-domain to be as independent as possible.</p>



<p>From the example above, we see that our food delivery system has different sub-domains. Two of these sub-domains are order management and delivery management. The models that represent the two sub-domains should be isolated. Order management models shouldn’t know anything about the delivery models and vice versa.</p>



<p>If we have a model that should be represented in the two sub-domains, we duplicate that model. For example â€“ both sub-domains need a customer as a model. When we copy the model, we extract only the required properties for the specific sub-domain.&nbsp; So it is normal to have a model with the same name but with different properties in different sub-domains (of-course, we track that model by uniform ID in both sub-domains).</p>



<h3><strong>Anemic vs. rich models</strong></h3>



<p>For domain models, there are two concepts. They are anemic and rich model implementation.</p>



<p>Anemic models are models with only properties without any logic. Often they are also badly encapsulated using just public setters and getters. For example, anemic models we use when we have a database-centric architecture (like layered architecture).</p>



<p>Rich models have business logic. They are very well encapsulated. Instead of public setters and getters, we use methods for all the specific operations. Rich model collections are read-only and can only be modified through the methods and the constructor. Rich models can not be created nor exist in an invalid state. The implementation should guarantee that after any operation, the model is in a valid state.</p>



<p>In domain-driven design, as you might guess, we use rich models.</p>



<h2><strong>Domain-driven design elements</strong></h2>



<p>Using the domain-driven design, we will face several different elements that build the core of it. They are:</p>



<ul><li>Entity</li><li>Value object</li><li>Aggregate (and Aggregate root)</li><li>Domain event</li><li>Factory</li><li>Repository</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Entity</strong></h3>



<p>An entity in domain-driven design is a rich model element that has a unique identification. For example, we might have an Order entity. Â&nbsp;The Order entity has an identifier (like autoincrement bigint). Using that identification, we track the entity and build relations.</p>



<h3><strong>Value object</strong></h3>



<p>Value objects are model elements that do not have a specific identification. Their identification is based on the comparison (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/equality-comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by value</a>) of all their attributes.</p>



<p>They also can contain business logic. Value objects mainly live as attributes of other entities.</p>



<p>A good example of a value object is the delivery address of the Order entity.</p>



<h3><strong>Aggregate</strong></h3>



<p>Aggregate is a very specific structure for the domain-driven design.</p>



<p>An aggregate is a group of objects that should be handled together. Every aggregate has an <strong>aggregate root</strong>. The aggregate root is the main object responsible for the control of the other objects.</p>



<p>Any command or request toward the elements in the aggregate should come through the aggregate root.</p>



<p>In our example, with the food delivery system, such an aggregate is the grouping of Order and OrderItem entities. In this case, the Order entity is the aggregate root. If we want to add a new OrderItem to the Order, we should do it through the aggregate root.</p>



<p>Entities that are “below” the root level should not allow state modification outside the aggregate.</p>



<p>Using aggregates, we strive to achieve an always valid business model.</p>



<h3><strong>Domain event</strong></h3>



<p>In domain-driven design, as we said, the models should be encapsulated and isolated as much as possible.</p>



<p>For example, the Order aggregate should not reference or be referenced by the Delivery aggregate.</p>



<p>They not only should not know about each other but also contract-based injection is forbidden.</p>



<p>The only right way of communication is through domain events (some of you may argue, but I firmly believe that).</p>



<p>Every aggregate can publish and subscribe to events.</p>



<p>If a new order is created, the Order aggregate publishes OrderCreatedEvent event. Every other aggregate that is interested in this event can handle it and process it.</p>



<p>Domain events are part of the domain model, but their artifacts are processed outside the domain layer. In the next article, we will see that in detail.</p>



<h3><strong>Factory</strong></h3>



<p>As most of you know, a factory is a design pattern for creating objects. In domain-driven design, the factory pattern isolates the creation of domain aggregates from the application layer.</p>



<p>In the best-case scenario, a factory should receive plain DTO (or just primitive types) and contains as little as possible logic.</p>



<p>Factory pattern should always create objects in a valid state.</p>



<h3><strong>Repository</strong></h3>



<p>The Repository is another well know pattern. The idea behind it is to encapsulate communication to the data storage and provide a layer of abstraction.</p>



<p>In domain-driven design, each aggregate root has a repository. But as we said, the domain model should not be familiar with any infrastructure mechanisms. That’s why we don’t put repository implementations in the domain model but the infrastructure layer.</p>



<p>In the domain model, we put only the contracts (interfaces) of the repositories. That also will be discussed in detail in the next article.</p>



<h2>Domain-driven design in short</h2>



<p>Let’s summarize.</p>



<p>Domain-driven design is a <strong>way of thinking</strong>.</p>



<p>Working very <strong>closely with the business people</strong>, we aim to model the different domains of the business.</p>



<p>We create models (entities, value objects, aggregates) using <strong>only simple classes and primitive types</strong>. We don’t care about persistence, UI, external integrations, external libraries, etc. These things don’t belong in our domain core.</p>



<p>Models <strong>have complex logic</strong>, but we <strong>strictly</strong> <strong>encapsulate</strong> that behavior. They are <strong>always in a valid state</strong>, even after their initial creation.</p>



<p>Often we group different models because they can not live in a valid state only by themselves. Those groups we call <strong>aggregates</strong>.</p>



<p>Models live in isolation, so they can not communicate directly. For that reason, we use <strong>domain events</strong>.</p>



<p>The domain core <strong>does not depend on anything</strong>. Other layers (like application and infrastructure) depend on it.</p>



<h2><strong>What is next?</strong></h2>



<p>As I said above, domain-driven design is a core concept of Clean <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/category/software-design-and-architecture/">architecture</a>, and that’s why it is essential to get comfortable with that way of thinking. It is entirely normal to be confused at first, but this should not discourage you.</p>



<p>As a next step, I suggest you read Eric Evans’s excellent book “Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software”. While reading it, try to apply the knowledge to systems you have already developed without DDD. Believe me, that exercise will help you a lot.</p>



<p>In the next article, we will see how the domain model fits in the Clean architecture structure and the point behind all this complexity.</p>

<p>Space Invaders is a fairly popular game, with many implementations. Here we will implement a simple version with space ships moving and descending and a cannon shooting them. The game could be extended with other features, but this is already a very long blog post… By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/da11a5e937960e69dc473be131be732d">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<p>We cannot have a Space Invader game without invaders, so let’s design these first. Usually, the graphics resources for games are created using specialized programs, but for a simple game like Space Invaders, we can just write the models as strings and write a some Racket functions to convert them into pictures. This is the same technique used in the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/03/a-game-of-tetris.html">A Game Of Tetris</a> blog post. For example, here is the definition for the first alien, which we’ll call Zabrak:</p>

<div>
 <table>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>
     </td>
    <td>
     <div>

    <span>" Z ZZZ Z "</span>
    <span>"Z       Z"</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>We can convert the above list of strings into a picture is just a few lines of code: each “Z” character is converted into a square, while the space characters are left empty. <code>row-&gt;squares</code> will convert a single string into a picture and <code>block-&gt;pict</code> combines the resulting pictures into a single block and applies the color to the blocks:</p>

<p>The end result can be displayed directly into the DrRacket REPL, allowing us to quickly get an idea of how the image will look like and make any necessary tweaks. We can design the look of our game graphics before we even get to write any of the actual game code:</p>

<p>The aliens in the game will be animated, having their antennas and legs move. This can be achieved by defining separate frames for each animation step:</p>

<p>We can visualize all the frames by applying <code>block-&gt;pict</code> on each of them, although it is difficult to see that the common parts overlap correctly and only the intended parts move:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a044/zabrak-all-frames.png" alt=""></p></div>

<h3 id="animations-in-the-repl">Animations in the REPL</h3>

<p>While the DrRacket REPL can display pictures directly, it cannot display animations. However, we can extend the REPL to support this: The REPL recognizes special objects, called “snips” which are objects that can display anything in the REPL. Snips can be used for a lot of cool things, such as using them directly in games, such as <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/ishido.html">Ishido</a> and <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2018/10/chess-game-using-racket-s-pasteboard.html">Chess Game Interface</a>, but also at providing complex visualizations in the REPL, for example an <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">interactive map</a>. Here we’ll write a simple snip to animate some pictures.</p>

<p>The <code>animation-snip-class</code> is an object which is used to deserialize snips — we don’t use this feature directly, but the Racket GUI system requires one such object to be defined for every type of snip class. The code is mostly boilerplate, but one such object needs to be defined for every type of snip used by the application, and each such object needs to have a different class name set using <code>set-classname</code>:</p>



<p>The <code>animation-snip%</code> class is the actual snip and derives from the <code>snip%</code> class from the Racket GUI libraries. When constructed, it receives a list of pictures, <code>picts</code>, which are the individual frames of the animation, as well as an <code>interval</code>, in milliseconds, which defines the time between changing pictures. It has the following member variables and methods:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> members of the snip define the width and height of  the entire snip, being the maximum of all the pictures — this allows using  different sized pictures for the animation.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><code>index</code> represents the current picture being displayed — a snip cannot  simply draw when it wants to, instead the system will invoke its <code>draw</code>  method at unspecified intervals, so it must be ready to draw its current  state at any time.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>on-refresh</code> method is invoked periodically from a timer (see <code>timer%</code>  creation below), and will increment the frame and tell the snip  administrator that this snip needs to be redrawn — this is how a snip can  inform the system that it has changed.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>copy</code> method creates a copy of the snip, this is required for snips  which are used directly in the DrRacket REPL, in this case, the  implementation is simple: it creates and returns new animation snip with the  same pictures and refresh interval.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>get-extent</code> method is invoked by the system to determine the size of  the snip — it is used to know how much space to reserve for it, so it lines  up nicely with other things in the REPL.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>draw</code> method is invoked by the system to actually draw the snip. While  the snip can draw anywhere it wants, it should usually draw at the passed  <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> coordinates, and not extend past the width and height it has  supplied to <code>get-extent</code>. In the animation snip case, the draw method uses  <code>draw-pict</code> (provided by the <code>pict</code> library), to draw the current picture.</p></li></ul>



<p>The <code>animation-snip%</code> can be used directly, but object creation can be verbose, so we can define a more convenient <code>animate</code> function which creates this snip:</p>

<div>
 <table>
  <tbody>
   <tr>

     </td>
    <td>
     <div>
      <pre><span></span><span>(</span><span><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))">define</a></span> <span>(</span><span>animate</span> <span>picts</span> <span>#:interval</span> <span>[</span><span>interval</span> <span>500</span><span>])</span>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>To visualize the actual animation, we can simply call <code>animate</code> with the list of the pictures provided by <code>block-&gt;pict</code>. Even though only three frames have been defined for this alien, the actual animation needs to go though the steps A, B, C, B before it cycles back to the first frame. This is something that is not easy to pick up if the animation frames are listed side-by-side, but it is immediately obvious once the animation is played.</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a044/zabrak.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<p>The <code>animation-snip%</code> itself will not be used in the game, but it is a useful tool in designing the game animations themselves. With the <code>animation-snip%</code> done, the rest of the aliens can be designed:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a044/all-aliens.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<p>You can design your own aliens: pictures for alien models can be easily found with an Internet search, and if you are unsure how to name the aliens, Wikipedia has a page listing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_alien_species:_Z">alien species names</a>. Finally, if you want to just have a look a the ones I defined, they are available in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/da11a5e937960e69dc473be131be732d">game source</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-the-arena">Prepare the Arena</h2>

<p>The Space Invaders game involves several “actors”: the alien ships moving across the screen, the canon moving left and right in response to user input and shooting lasers and the lasers hitting space ships. These actors need to be able to draw the object in the game window, respond to keyboard input and interact witch each other (for example, when a laser shot hits a space ship). The actors will also need a common “clock”, which measures the passage of time — this will be used both to drive animations and move objects across the screen.</p>

<p>We will need to write some code to manage the shared access to these resources and provide a common interface for the actors. This code is relatively generic: it does not know anything about the game or the game rules itself and could be reused to implement other games. For more serious games, this would be called a “game engine” but our code is too simple to deserve that name, so we will not use it here, instead we will call it an “arena”.</p>

<h3 id="the-scene">The Scene</h3>

<p>All the game actors can be kept in a global list named <code>scene</code>, with the <code>add-actor</code> and <code>remove-actor</code> functions added as a convenience. Actors such as space ships will be added at the start of the game, but other actors, like laser shots will be added during the game. Finally, actors can also be removed during the game, for example a space ship which was hit by a laser shot.</p>



<h3 id="the-gui">The GUI</h3>

<p>The game itself will be displayed in a window, which, in Racket GUI is a <code>frame%</code>. Frame objects also receive keyboard events and by overriding the <code>on-subwindow-char</code> method we can intercept these and send them to all the actors in the scene. The frame will also be notified when the window is closed, via the <code>on-close</code> method and we use this opportunity to set the <code>game-outcome</code> to <code>'abandoned</code>. The game loop described below will monitor this variable to know when to exit the game.</p>



<p>A somewhat unusual technique is used to create <code>the-frame%</code> in the code above: we create a class derived from <code>frame%</code> using <code>class</code>, than immediately instantiate that derived class and assign the resulting object to <code>the-frame</code>. In other languages, this is a two step process, but in Racket, they can be combined:</p>

    <p>Recently Google Photos ended their unlimited storage. You shouldn’t have been shocked, because unlimited is more often than not an unsustainable Ponzi Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="good-at-business">Good at Business</h2>

<p>When a software company gives you unlimited storage for anything, the only way for them to maintain that business in the long run is for them to make (amortized or not) incremental and recurring money from each thing they store. This is true, because storage is a recurring and forever cost.</p>

<p>Most B2C companies don’t make recurring money off of the data they store for you. They make money inversely proportional to how recent you stored the thing. Sometimes they don’t make any money at all. So it’s no surprise that unlimited is a Ponzi scheme, because that’s the only way to make the ledger look right.</p>

<h2 id="the-unlimited-ponzi-scheme">The Unlimited Ponzi Scheme</h2>

<p>Businesses will often follow a Ponzi Scheme-esque model with storage for their product. As they go through growth, newer customers are instantly delivering new revenue while their cost is very little - they haven’t started accruing much data. These customers offset older customers, who are getting more expensive as data retention continues forever.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the growth stops. You’ve gained most of the market you’re going to gain.  All of the sudden margin starts to slip. Fewer new users exist to offset the old users People look into and realize the unlimited scheme is up. Then they implement a retention policy and customers freak out.</p>

<h2 id="handling-unlimited-as-a-business">Handling Unlimited as a Business</h2>

<p>Businesses often fail at unlimited in a few ways.</p>

<p>First, companies should offer a way to pay more to get more storage. I can’t be mad that you won’t run a ridiculous business for me. I will get mad if you sink me into your product and don’t give me the option to pay a fair value to continue service.</p>

<p>Second, companies should be mindful of data retention policies from day 1.  The unlimited Ponzhi scheme is in many products not something that companies even know is happening. Things look good  until they don’t.</p>

<p>If you keep data around without retention policies, you will face a long road of performance, stability, and customer issues as you scale. Especially as your growth numbers slow, you should be mindful of the upcoming business realities sooner rather than later if you have anything that is unlimited in your product.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There’s no free lunch in this world unless you’re willing to run around to different dumpsters to get it.</p>

December 13, 2020 | https://supabase.io/blog/2020/12/13/supabase-dashboard-performance | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supabase.io/blog/2020/12/13/supabase-dashboard-performance">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Supabase dashboard has become more feature-rich in the last month. We have a powerful SQL editor backed by <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monaco</a>. We built an Airtable-like view of your database, making editing a breeze.</p><blockquote><p>Features, performance, DX - choose three</p></blockquote><p>Performance can quickly regress when adding new features, especially in a Single Page Application. Here are the steps we took to guarantee a good baseline performance within our application, without compromising on the developer experience (DX).</p><h2>Establishing a baseline and setting targets</h2><blockquote><p>You can't fix what you can't measure</p></blockquote><p>There was some low-hanging fruit to improve performance, but we had one important thing to do before that - establish a baseline.</p><p>Our dashboard is JavaScript heavy, so we started by setting up analytics to track our bundle sizes. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next-bundle-analyzer</a> (or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webpack-bundle-analyzer</a>) provides an interactive treemap of your generated JavaScript bundles. This is our treemap when we started. It gave us a clear indication what changes we needed to achieve the most impact.</p><p><img alt="Nextjs tree analyzer" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/nextjs-tree-analyzer-6f23c1b4ea133c2504cf7b28accb70b0.png"></p><p>There are some great tools when it comes to Real User Monitoring (RUM). We chose the newly-launched <a href="https://sentry.io/for/performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry performance monitoring</a> product since we already use Sentry for error tracking and we wanted to minimize new tools in our stack. It also supports reporting <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core Web Vitals</a>, the performance metrics created by Google to track initial loading performance, responsiveness and visual stability. Core Web Vitals come with recommended target values, giving us clear goals to hit.</p><p><img alt="Core Web Vitals" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/core-web-vitals-a0d3b17c36d3558584c936e3f18b83bc.png"></p><h2>Improving our JavaScript bundle size</h2><blockquote><p>How to not load the entire npm registry into our user's browsers</p></blockquote><h3>Choosing smaller modules</h3><p>We used <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bundlephobia</a> on our largest modules. This is a great website to have in your JS-performace arsenal. It gives the size of npm modules across different versions and recommends alternate modules with similar functionality which are smaller.</p><p><code>Moment.js</code> is notorious for its large bundle size and we don't need complex date processing for our dashboard. It was straightforward to switch to <a href="https://day.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">day-js</a> which is largely API-compatible with <code>Moment.js</code>. This change reduced our gzipped bundle size by 68 KB.</p><p>We migrated from <code>Joi</code> to <code>ajv</code> for our schema validation which was 32% smaller. <code>ajv</code> was already bundled as a transitive dependency of other modules, making it a no-brainer.</p><p><img alt="NPM dependencies" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/npm-dependencies-9ed695359c510422e6d9d8927589276d.png"></p><p>We reverted our <a href="https://github.com/brix/crypto-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto-js</a> module from version 4.0 to 3.3.0. Version 4.0 <a href="https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">injects more than 400kb code</a> when used in a browser context. The newer version replaces <code>Math.random</code> with node's implementation, injecting the entire node crypto module into the browser context. We use <code>crypto-js</code> for decrypting user's API keys and so we're not reliant on the randomness of the PRNG. We might move to a dedicated module like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aes-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aes-js</a> in the future since it has a much smaller surface area than <code>crypto-js</code> (in terms of security and performance).</p><h3>Using partial imports</h3><p>By selectively importing functions from modules like <code>lodash</code>, we cut the gzipped size by another 40kb across all our bundles.</p><div><div><div><div><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> _ </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> find </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash/find'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> debounce </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash/debounce'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> find</span><span>,</span><span> debounce </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash'</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In the above example, we added <a href="https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">babel-plugin-lodash</a> to our babel configuration which cherry picks the exact <code>lodash</code> functions we import. This makes it easier to import from <code>lodash</code> without cluttering the code with selective import statements.</p><h3>Moving complex logic to the server</h3><p>Thanks to some skilled haxors (well, weak passwords mainly) we had crypto miners running on some of our customer's databases. To prevent this, we enforce password strength with the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zxcvbn</a> module. Though it improved our overall security, the module is <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=zxcvbn@4.4.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty big</a>, weighing in at 388kb gzipped. To get around this, we moved the password-strength checking logic to an API. Now, the frontend queries a server with a user-supplied password and the server computes its strength. This eliminates the module from the frontend.</p><h3>Lazy loading code</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xlsx</a> is another complex and large module, which is used to import spreadsheets into tables. We contemplated moving this logic to the backend, but we found another solution: lazy loading it.</p><p>The spreadsheet import is triggered when the user is creating a new table. However the code was previously loaded every time the page was visited - even when a new table was not being created. This made it a good candidate for lazy loading. Using <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js dynamic imports</a> we are able to load this component (313 kb brotlied) dynamically, whenever the user clicks the "Add content" button.</p><video width="99%" muted="" playsinline="" controls=""><source src="https://supabase.io/videos/lazy_loading.mov" type="video/mp4" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>We use the same technique to lazy load some Lottie animations which are relatively large.</p><h3>Using native browser APIs</h3><p>We decided against supporting IE11, opening up more avenues for optimization. Using native browser APIs enabled us to drop even more dependencies. For example, since the <a href="https://caniuse.com/fetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fetch API is available</a> in all the browsers we care about, we removed <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axios</a> and built a simple wrapper using the native fetch API.</p><h2>Improving Vercel's default caching</h2><blockquote><p>The fastest request is the request not made</p></blockquote><p>We noticed that Vercel was sending a <code>Cache-Control</code> header of <code>public, max-age=0, must-revalidate</code> , preventing some of our SVG, CSS and font files from being cached in the browser.</p><p>We updated our <code>next.config.js</code> , adding a long <code>max-age</code> to the caching header that Vercel sends. Our assets are versioned properly, so we were able to safely do this.</p><h2>Enabling Next.js Automatic Static Optimization</h2><p>Next.js is able to automatically pre-render a page to HTML, whenever a page meets some pre-conditions. This mode is called <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automatic Static Optimization</a>. Pre-rendered pages can be cached on a CDN for extremely fast page loads. We removed calls to <code>getServerSideProps</code> and <code>getInitialProps</code> to take advantage of this mode.</p><h2>Developing a performance culture</h2><blockquote><p>Always in sight, always in mind</p></blockquote><p>Our performance optimization journey will never be complete. It requires constant vigilance to maintain a baseline across our users. To instill this within our team, we took a few actions.</p><p>We developed a Slack bot which sends our Sentry performance dashboard every week, containing our slowest transactions and our Core Web Vitals summary. This shows which pages need improvement and where our <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users are the most miserable</a>.</p><p>During our transition from Alpha to Beta, performance was one of the important features, along with stability and security. We considered performance implications while choosing libraries and tools. Having a "seat at the table" in these discussions ensures that performance is not considered as an after-thought.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>With these changes, we have a respectable Core Web Vitals score. This is a snapshot from Sentry with RUM data from the last week. We are within the recommended threshold for all the 3 Web Vitals.</p><p><img alt="Sentry results" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/sentry-results-6006d8a310931d64ef56d05f5a9f7194.png"></p><p>Our Next.js build output also shows that users download &lt; 200 kb of JavaScript between any two page transitions. We're still improving too - even though we provide a lot of functionality in our dashbaord, we will continue to reduce our bundle sizes.</p><h2>Things that did not work</h2><blockquote><p>You win some, you lose some</p></blockquote><p>We tried a VSCode plugin called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Import cost</a> which shows the size of JavaScript modules when you import it in your editor. However, the plugin did not work on our codebase since it doesn't support some JavaScript features, like optional chaining.</p><p>We also passed on using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lodash-webpack-plugin</a> even though it had the potential to reduce our JavaScript sizes, because it could potentially break our code if not used carefully. This plugin would require our frontend team to understand the Webpack configuration, updating it whenever they use a new lodash feature set.</p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>Our broad goal is to implement best practices for frontend performance, and make it exciting to all of our team.

<blockquote>
<p>If I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m gonna be pissed and miserable every time… because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me.</p>

<p>– David Foster Wallance</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>David Foster Wallace </strong></a> gave this&nbsp;commencement speech to the 2005 graduating class at Kenyon College. This appears to be the only speech David Foster Wallace gave outlining his views on how to approach life generally. Time magazine has ranked <i>This Is Water</i> among the best commencement speeches ever delivered, and in 2009 it was compiled and augment <a href="https://amzn.to/2KkgWSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into a fairly pretty book</a>.</p>
<p>In the speech, Wallace digs into higher education and what the true value of it might be. He suggests that its end-game purpose is not to teach students facts and figures or fill their heads with knowledge – but instead, it brings the most value to students by teaching them how to consciously choose how to think from a perspective that is not your own, think about meaning, and act appropriately in everyday life.</p>
<p>The topics Wallace was working through in this speech were further explored in his final novel, <a href="https://amzn.to/3niIJ4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pale King</a>, which was published in 2011, uncompleted, following his suicide.</p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p>Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005.</p>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” <strong>And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?</strong>”</p>
<p>This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches – the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don’t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that<strong> the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.</strong> Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but <strong>the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance</strong>, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.</p>
<p>Of course, the main requirement of speeches like this is that I’m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education’s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let’s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about “teaching you how to think.”</p>
<p>If you’re like me as a student, you’ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I’m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant <strong>education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about</strong>. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.</p>
<p>Here’s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn’t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. “Well then you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his eyes. “No, man, all that was was a couple of Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: <strong>the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people</strong>, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from inside the two guys. As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there’s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: <strong>blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up</strong>.</p>
<p>The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. <strong>Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded</strong>. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.</p>
<p>Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the real-est, most vivid, and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of you or behind you, to the left or right of you, on your TV or your monitor. And so on. Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.</p>
<p>Please don’t worry that I’m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It’s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being “well-adjusted”, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.</p>
<p>Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education – at least in my own case – is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in an abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.</p>
<p>As I’m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (which may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: <strong>learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think</strong>. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about “the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.”</p>
<p>This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.</p>
<p>And I submit that this is what the real, <strong>no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, …</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div>

GitHub pages are the best way to host static blogs like <code>Gatsby</code>. One of the most common ways to do this is, maintain your code in main/master branch, build it, and then push the code to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
There are various CI that easily automate this process like Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
With GitHub actions, this would be a piece of cake, and without depending on any third-party provider. From the docs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not sure what are GitHub actions please visit <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">here</a>.</p>
<h2><center> Workflow </center></h2>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ol>
<li>You have a static blog(let’s say gatsby) setup, the code for your blog is in master branch.</li>
<li>You have a build script in your package.json</li>
<li>You have setup your GitHub pages (or pointed to your custom domain) in <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Process</h4>
<center><strong> Step 1 </strong></center><br>
Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages">gh-pages npm package</a> in your project, this is a small utility package which helps to publish your code to gh-pages branch.
You can skip this step in case you want to push all contents from master to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.  
<center><strong>Step 2 </strong></center><br>
Add a deploy script in your <code>package.json</code>. This script should do 2 jobs
<ol>
<li>Build the project, make it ready for being published.</li>
<li>Push the changes to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, this pushes the code to <code>gh-pages</code> via npm package.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>"deploy": "gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -r https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;.git"</code></pre></div>
<center><strong>Step 3 </strong></center><br>
Generate an access token and add it to secret of your repository.
<ol>
<li>Create an access token: goto <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a>, create a new token, give it access for repo and workflow.  </li>
</ol>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<center><strong>Step 4 </strong></center>  
<ol>
<li>Create a workflow file, you need to create a file in following path: <code>.github/workflows/&lt;some-name-you-like&gt;.yml</code>, its important to have <code>.yml</code> extension and have exact same path.</li>
<li>
<p>Following action file is complete enough to publish <code>gh-pages</code>, every time a new commit is merged in master branch. ✅</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> gh<span>-</span>pages publisher 🚀

<span>on</span><span>:</span>
<span>push</span><span>:</span>
  <span>branches</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> master <span>]</span>

<span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
<span>publish-gh-pages</span><span>:</span>
  <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> ubuntu<span>-</span>latest
  <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
     <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> actions/checkout@v2
     <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> actions/setup<span>-</span>node@v1
     <span>with</span><span>:</span>
        <span>node-version</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span>
     <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm ci
     <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> git config user.name "&lt;user name<span>&gt;</span>" <span>&amp;&amp;</span> git config user.email "user email"
     <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm run deploy
     <span>env</span><span>:</span>
        <span>GH_TOKEN</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span>secrets.SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN<span>}</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This script is pretty self-explanatory, it performs the following tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It specifies to work only on <code>push</code> on <code>master</code></li>
<li>Sets up a <code>node 12</code> environment</li>
<li>Installs dependencies via <code>npm ci</code></li>
<li>Sets up git requirements for username and email (required to do a push to branch)</li>
<li>Run the deploy script</li>
<li>In case you don’t use gh-pages npm package, you can write another step for git push to gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>At last, we set up env variable <code>GH_TOKEN</code> from our action secret (which you set up in step 3), this env variable would be available in <code>package.json</code></li>
</ul>
<center><strong>Step 5 </strong></center><br>
Commit this file and see your first <code>action</code> in action (sorry for the pun 🙈 )
<hr>
<center>Hope this helps 🙏🙏🙏</center>
<hr>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You can see the actions running here: <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;/actions</code>.</li>
<li>Workflow file for <a href="https://itsopensource.com/">itsopensource.com</a> can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/tsl143/itsopensource/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages-publish.yml">here</a>.</li>

  <div>
    <p>In news that surprises nobody, Goodreads last week quietly announced the deprecation of their public APIs. And I mean really quietly – the only people who were told about this were those unfortunate enough to have their existing <a href="https://blog.stephanieawilkinson.com/posts/2020-12-10-yonderbook-and-goodreads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API keys disabled</a> without warning. Other than a small banner at the top of the API docs which mentions vague “plans to retire these tools”, nobody else appears to have heard anything from Goodreads, including those whose API keys remain active. So far it seems any key unused for 30 days has been disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://joealcorn.co.uk/assets/img/posts/2020/12/deprecated.png" alt="Deprecation notice on Goodreads API documentation"></p>

<p>So this is an “announcement” much in the way a windshield announces its presence to bugs on a highway, and with the same consequences: dead bugs. Some developers have taken to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21788520-api-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API discussion boards</a> and blogs, but the overall impression I’m getting is grim acceptance. Really the surprising thing is how long it took them: Amazon has been in charge at Goodreads for almost 8 years now, and I think we’ve all been expecting this to come at some point.</p>

<p>So why now? What’s changed? Well, the fact is the market’s changing – and Goodreads isn’t. Alternative options are starting to emerge, and since Goodreads has forgotten how to innovate, it wants to use its market position to stifle innovation instead.</p>

<p>The sad thing is it really only hurts the hobbyist projects and Goodreads users themselves. Anybody seriously attempting to compete with Goodreads is well aware of the Amazon-shaped elephant in the room and is likely prepared. It’s the users and the hackers that this move will harm, and if anything it further reinforces the need for viable alternatives.</p>

<p>Personally I’m going to continue pouring my efforts into building <a href="https://beta.readng.co/?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readng</a>. I’m already using it to keep track of my reads &amp; collections, along with a few thousand beta testers. I’m really excited by our plans and think we have the right team to execute, but we also need a shift in consumer behaviour.</p>

<p>The web has to mature beyond advertising as a business model. For this to happen people are going to have to open their wallets, pay for the services they use, and support independent businesses. That’s how we build a web where indies can thrive - one that’s more village centre than financial centre. I think the shift is underway.</p>


<hr>

<p>PS: <a href="https://beta.readng.co/user/joe?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s my own readng profile</a>. You should probably use our Goodreads importer while our API key works, huh?</p>

<p><i>The Google Bug Tracker helps them(Google) in tracking through different bugs and security issues, but Gopal, a highly skilled security researcher managed to leverage and pilferage Google through its own issue tracker, isn't it quite creative? A defensive mechanism, since the same tool is used to track and patch security issues was implemented to pervade through Google's protection.</i></p>

<p>
&nbsp;Every organisation have bug trackers, in fact, for example most companies use external ones like Jira bug tracker to track and resolve bugs, so what makes Google's case unique in particular is their custom tailored Issue Tracker and it's features. Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/gopalsinghcse" target="_blank">Gopal </a>discovered that although Google had in the past attempted to fix several security issues in their Bug Tracker, yet, it was unsafe and indeed his firm conviction led to him finding a different issue, that can be called a regression but nevertheless, he bypassed Google's previous fix proving the fact - No system can be made "secure" (completely), no matter what amount of patches you make, this again shows the need for bug bounties to motivate and attract highly talented talented individuals as Gopal, and also motivates security researchers to use offensive methods as the one mentioned in this case, and keep trying harder to circumvent all security measures kept in place, even previous patches.</p>

<p>

<h2>
<span><span>How I managed to get a Google organisation email, bypassing their previous patch!</span></span></h2>
</div>
<p>
I came across this <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/messing-with-the-google-buganizer-system-for-15-600-in-bounties-58f86cc9f9a5" target="_blank">writeup</a> by&nbsp;<a data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="7fa68cbc850e" data-action="show-user-card" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan" data-user-id="7fa68cbc850e" href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan" target="_blank">Alex</a>. I started testing the issue tracker, and I wanted to see if I could somehow manage to get an @google.com Account. In the issue tracker, I found the&nbsp;<i>browse components feature. </i>There&nbsp;were two public issue trackers, I clicked on Android Public Tracker</p>
<p>
Bugs reported to <i>Android </i>showed up here. To report a Bug in Android public issue tracker you may simply send an email to-</p>
<p><span>buganizer-system+</span><em>componentID</em><span>@google.com</span></p>
<p>
In this case, android’s component id is <b>190923</b>.</p>
<p>
The issue I made, got listed in the public issue tracker. I got a confirmation email from&nbsp;<span>buganizersystem+my_email@google.com&nbsp;</span>and hence, replies to the email would be directed to-</p>
<p><span>buganizer-system+</span><em>componentID</em><span><em>+</em></span><em>issueID</em><span>@google.com</span></p>
<p>
I replied to that email and comment was posted in the conversation. I can add google email to see if I can get a confirmation code, to test this I clicked on&nbsp;<a data-href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Forwarding and POP/IMAP</a>&nbsp;in Gmail settings and added the google email to the forwarding email address. I was surprised to see I got a confirmation code in the Android public issue tracker.</p>
<p>
There are two parts here, to get a google account.&nbsp;<span>Signup</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>verification</span>. I can verify a google account, but I could not signup for a @google.com account so my report got closed as <i>Won’t Fix. Bummer!</i></p>
<figure id="aa11" name="aa11"><div>


</div>
</figure><figure id="272e" name="272e"><div>


</div>
</figure>
<p>
Then I started visiting every subdomain of Google to see if I could use google.com email to signup and this new signup page appeared.</p>
<figure id="98a9" name="98a9"><div>


</div>
</figure>
<p>
I could feel my heartbeats racing, after coming across this new signup page. I signed up using the bug…@google.com email and then it asked me to verify by entering the code.</p>
<h3 id="295b" name="295b">
Verifying The email&nbsp;address</h3>
<p>
I was waiting for the verification code in the conversation and then received the verification code in the mail.</p>
<figure id="85a3" name="85a3"><div>

</figure><figure id="bd07" name="bd07"><div>


</div>

<p>
After successfully signing up for the Google Account, I reopened the issue.</p>
<p><span>Nice catch!</span></p>
<figure id="18b4" name="18b4"><div>


</div>
</figure>
<p>
Finally, at 9:50 PM that day, the most awaited email arrived&nbsp;<span>$3133.70</span>. I could not sleep the whole night.</p>

  <article>
  <p>Haskell Object Observation Debugger (HOOD) is a small post-mortem
debugger for the lazy functional language
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. It is based on the concept of
observation of intermediate data structures, rather than the more
traditional stepping and variable examination paradigm used by
imperative language debuggers.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Observation of base types (Int, Bool, Float, etc)</li>
  <li>Observation of both finite and infinite structures (Lists, trees,
arrays, etc).</li>
  <li>Observation of usage patterns for functions.</li>
  <li>Observation of monadic actions, including IO actions.</li>
  <li>Hooks to add observational capabilities for new base type and used
defined types.</li>
  <li>Programmable browsing capabilities - structure browsers can be coded
and plugged in.</li>
  <li>Includes a basic structure rendering package that uses a
Haskell-like syntax.</li>
  <li>Thread-safe observations are are supported.</li>
  <li>Supports observations on exceptions (on certain compilers).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Hood can observe data structures:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main = runO ex2

ex2 = print
      . reverse
      . (observe "intermediate")
      . reverse
      $ [0..9]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program gives this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

-- intermediate
  9 : 8 : 7 : 6 : 5 : 4 : 3 : 2 : 1 : 0 : []
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hood can also observe functions, showing both the arguments and result
of each call:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main = runO ex9

ex9 = print $ observe "foldl (+) 0 [1..4]" foldl (+) 0 [1..4]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program gives this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10

-- foldl (+) 0 [1..4]
  { \ { \ 0 1  -&gt; 1
      , \ 1 2  -&gt; 3
      , \ 3 3  -&gt; 6
      , \ 6 4  -&gt; 10
      } 0 (1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : []) 
       -&gt; 10
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that Hood preserves the type and strictness properties of the
function under observation. If an argument is not examined in the
function, it remains unevaluated. As an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghci&gt; runO $ print $ observe "sum xs" (\ xs ys -&gt; sum xs) [0..2] [0..]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that ys is left unevaluated (denoted by the underscore):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3

-- sum xs
  { \ (0 : 1 : 2 : []) _  -&gt; 3
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Hood was developed at OGI, in 1999, for GHC 4.X. We are looking into a
debugging toolkit for Haskell and Lava, so we ported Hood to GHC 6.X,
and re-released it on hackage. We hope you find it useful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607775961422/elXIChWIZ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into Horcruxing, here's a quick prologue on online security hygiene. You can skip to the  <a href="#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Horcruxing section</a>  if it seems redundant.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>

  <section>
    
    

    <p>by Francis Tseng</p>

<p>The application that introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing to the mainstream was file sharing, services like Napster, Kazaa, Gnutella, and BitTorrent. For me, these programs were the first time the contradiction of artificial scarcity—the imposed scarcity of infinitely replicable digital information—and the excessive measures that were used to enforce it became startlingly clear. Over time, I encountered the term P2P in other settings and alongside other ideas—democratic governance, communalism, autonomy, cooperatives—and I started to see the purchase this idea had beyond file sharing and networking protocols.</p>

<p><a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/the-p2p-foundation/about-the-p2p-foundation">The P2P Foundation’s mission and strategic priorities</a>, for example, extend the early P2P ideas of open culture and exchange into values of cooperative living and regenerative production. <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles/">Scuttlebutt, a more recent P2P social networking protocol, has its own “principles stack”</a> that similarly advocates pluralistic exchange and mutual interdependence. It’s beautiful how, at least in the ideal scenario, by using a P2P service we are helping others access it as well. P2P is both an acknowledgment of our shared needs and an example of how cooperation helps us fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve followed along with P2P projects because of these shared values, and I always find it exciting when new projects emerge. It seems that P2P is experiencing something of a renaissance, likely due to the frenzy around blockchain (which purports to offer something similar to P2P) and the increasing popular anxiety around centralized internet services like Facebook.</p>

<p>Urbit, “<a href="https://urbit.org/">a personal server built from scratch</a>,” first came across my radar a couple of years ago. Urbit positions itself as a P2P project, but it stands out in contrast to other P2P projects, mainly because the person behind it, Curtis Yarvin, seems antithetical to what I understand P2P to represent.</p>

<p>My central question is this: <em>Is Urbit a project that should be supported?</em></p>

<p>We can further break this down into two parts. First, Urbit’s marketing materials correctly identify that concentrated data aggregation and decision-making power are fundamental issues of the internet-as-we-know-it. Twitter’s persistent neglect of harassment on its platform is one everyday example. It is clear that new protocols and platforms that reduce our dependency on distant power are needed to challenge these issues. What’s less clear, though, is whether or not Urbit actually offers a meaningful alternative. Does Urbit genuinely enable new kinds of relations? Or, does it merely replace the old aristocracy with a new one?</p>

<p>The second, and more urgent, question is: who and what are we supporting by supporting Urbit? Many people in tech still believe that technology can be divorced from its creators; however, those of us in tech need to recognize that we have a considerable amount of influence over which products enter the mainstream consciousness, which products get created at all, and who receives both financial and social capital (shout out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> et al.). For example, consider Peter Thiel , who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Early support of PayPal and Facebook contributed to their financial success, which developed Thiel’s influence and made him quite rich. Thiel then turned that money and influence into Palantir Technologies, a software company that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/">develops technologies to help expand surveillance and deportation for the government</a>. We have to consider what similar groundwork we help to lay by supporting Urbit.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>In order to discuss Urbit’s design, we need to have an understanding of the politics of its creator, Curtis Yarvin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin">Curtis Yarvin</a> is innocuously described on Wikipedia as an “American political theorist and computer scientist,” but to many, he is better known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/">one of the intellectual forebears of the alt-right</a>. From 2007 to 2014<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, working under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin writings, which among other things espoused anti-democratic ideas and scientific racism and helped introduce many of what are now understood as the alt-right’s foundational ideologies to a wider public. The term “red pill,” which describes the process of reactionary radicalization and the community around it, was first used in this way by Yarvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Defenders of Urbit are quick to dismiss any inclusion of Yarvin’s politics in discussions about Urbit as unfair or irrelevant, and might point out that Yarvin left the project in January of this year.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> However, given that Yarvin basically laid out the general design for Urbit independently, as he worked on it alone for 11 years<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and in parallel with his political writings<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and that Urbit, as a P2P project, is a fundamentally social and thus incorporates ideas about how people should be organized, Yarvin’s politics should be considered as something that influences his design decisions and his long-term vision for the project. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/z5j1hq/urbit_2017#c_4z4gik">Dog-whistles</a> have been identified in some of his writing about Urbit and its design, including his <a href="https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">leaning on Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt</a> for questions around Urbit’s governance.</p>

<p>To save space I’ll provide only a very brief overview of Yarvin’s political philosophy—if you like, you can read more about it <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis">here</a>, <a href="https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/">here</a>, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">here</a>, and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yavin refers to his brand of political philosophy as “neocameralism.” Neocameralism, as described in his essay “<a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/against-political-freedom/">Against Political Freedom</a>,” is a political philosophy arguing that state should be run like a business, (i.e., with a CEO at its head and no democratic mechanisms). His ideas are credited as being foundational to the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">neoreactionary” movement</a>, which could be described as a neo-monarchist movement (though Yarvin himself doesn’t identify as a “monarchist” because of its association with a constitutional monarchy and not absolute monarchy). In the neoreactionary movement, “divine right” is supplanted with “genetic right” based on scientific racism reframed as “human biodiversity.” Yarvin’s writings are also popular within the right-libertarian sects of Silicon Valley, such as <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">with Peter Thiel</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon">Peter Thiel also has a stake in Tlön</a>, Yarvin’s company which develops Urbit, via Thiel’s VC firm, Founders Fund). The point here is that Yarvin is not a fringe philosopher. His writings have influence over people with considerable power and contributes to the intellectual miasma that emboldens and normalizes anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic, and racist policies and attacks.</p>

<h2 id="urbit">Urbit</h2>
<h4 id="a-self-sovereign-internet">A self-sovereign internet</h4>

<p>Urbit positions itself as infrastructure for self-sovereignty in the digital age, liberating people from ceding control of their data to corporations.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The core idea is that Urbit helps you run a personal server that acts as an intermediary between you and other services, including existing services like Facebook (yes, there is a lot more to Urbit—such as its reinvention of parts of the lower-level computational stack—but its P2P layer is what’s of interest here).</p>

<p>Self-sovereignty is an important principle, and I wager that many who regularly use the internet would agree that more of it is valuable for a healthy internet: for being able to control who can access your data, who can and cannot contact you, and so on. <em>But</em>, self-sovereignty is far too vague of a concept on its own. Left- and right-libertarianism both start with self-sovereignty as a core value, but they end up with vastly different conceptions of what meaningful self-sovereignty looks like and how it can be achieved. Left-libertarianism finds that self-sovereignty arises from social organizing, care, and democratic governance, which build towards positive freedoms (freedom to learn, to flourish, and so on); whereas, right-libertarianism believes it comes from the market and that negative freedoms (freedom from restrictions and regulation) are the goal. Though Yarvin does not identify as a libertarian (he is, in his own words, sympathetic to it), his neocameralism is right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> of corporate tyranny and serfdom.</p>

<p>To draw an example that you might be familiar with, consider the Twitter-alternative, Gab, which markets itself as a bastion for free speech. Gab, in practice, operates as a niche platform for members of the far-right who have been banned from Twitter: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html">a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists</a>”. We might ask then, is Gab a platform for free speech, or is it a platform for hate speech? Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.</p>

<p>In a similar way, this slipperiness of self-sovereignty as a concept, especially in light of Yarvin’s political writings, makes me suspicious of what it really means in the context of Urbit. Is Urbit actually designed to give users more autonomy and control? Does it restore any power to internet users?</p>

<p>One central design feature of Urbit is its network hierarchy. As a participant in Urbit, you may be a galaxy (the top of the hierarchy), a star (which fall under galaxies), or a planet (which fall under stars). The description of this hierarchy <a href="https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/6ac688960687aa9c89d4da6fff49a3125c10aca1/Spec/urbit/3-intro.txt">used to use explicitly feudal metaphors</a> as part of what Yarvin called “digital feudalism,” with himself as the “prince,” and further contributes to my suspicion of Yarvin’s conception of self-sovereignty actually entails.</p>

<p>In trying to backpedal on these naming conventions, Yarvin claims that his ideas about governance are flipped for the internet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the real world today is governed as an insanely dysfunctional republic, and the Internet today is governed as a cluster of insanely despotic corporate monarchies, it doesn’t strike me as at all inconsistent with historical thought to treat the former case of misgovernment with efficient monarchism, and the latter case with liberating republicanism.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/11/21/kde-introducing-kopeninghours.html">KOpeningHours</a>,
a new library to parse and interpret <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours">OSM opening hours</a>
expressions. Here is now how we make use of this in <a href="https://apps.kde.org/en/itinerary">KDE Itinerary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="highlight-open-entities">Highlight Open Entities</h3>

<p>Based on your travel bookings KDE Itinerary knows when and for how long you are going to be at a train station or airport.
Combined with now understanding opening hours information we can determine which shop, restaurant, amenity or other entity is
open during that time span. Things closed for your entire stay will be grayed out on the station map.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/72/kde-itinerary-station-map-closed-entities.png" alt="Train station map using colored icons for open shops/restaurants/amenities, and gray ones for those closed ones.">
  
  <figcaption>Shops, restaurants or amenities closed during a layover are grayed out.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This of course is most useful at very large stations or airports and shorter layovers, where walking longer distances in vain
would be rather inconvenient.</p>

<h3 id="human-readable-opening-hours">Human-readable Opening Hours</h3>

<p>Another place where we made use of this is the information dialog for a selected element on the map.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/72/kde-itinerary-station-map-opening-hours-details.png" alt="Opening hours information for a selected element on the map presented both in textual and visual form.">
  
  <figcaption>Textual description of the current opening state and visual overview of the current week.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two things in here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A textual description of the current state and the next state change. This is the information you are most likely
looking for regarding the opening time.</li>
  <li>A visual representation of the current week. The benefit of that might be less obvious for simple opening hours
expressions like <code>Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00</code>, but as soon as they get slightly more complex interpreting that manually becomes
tricky and potentially error prone. Consider for example the simple <code>PH off</code> (closed on public holidays) addition.
In your home region you likely know when there is a public holiday, in other countries you might encounter
surprises though (remember e.g. Akademy 2018).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3>

<p>At this point I considered the opening hours topic sufficiently covered, just leaving the
<a href="https://marc.info/?t=160761966300016&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">standard KDE review process</a>
to be done for integrating this into the 21.04 release service.</p>

<p>Then I however got contacted by an OSM contributor, who, after having imported the opening hours
of all French post offices into OSM and finding himself confronted with a number of false-positive
warnings by the OSM validator, was looking into improving the
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose">Osmose OSM validator</a>
for opening hours expressions. KOpeningHours was apparently performing quite well during an evaluation for this,
and is therefore <a href="https://github.com/osm-fr/osmose-backend/issues/555">being considered as a parser for the validator</a>.</p>

<p>The requirements on the parser for validation are higher than for the evaluation use I had
originally in mind. Rejecting to evaluate things we aren’t certain about is enough for KDE Itinerary’s use,
however a validator shouldn’t produce false positives and also needs to accepts all kinds of rare edge cases
correctly. This has already resulted in a number of improvements to KOpeningHours, which of course
also benefit KDE Itinerary.</p>

<p>Said OSM contributor is a certain David Faure btw, the world is very small.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE —&nbsp;Back in August, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with a group of economists in Beijing. “In the coming period, we will face more and more headwinds,” he <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/25/c_139314902.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, using unusually blunt language. Without naming names, Xi talked about China’s worsening trade and technology war with the United States under President Donald Trump, set against a backdrop of growing certainty in Beijing that America is bent on containing his nation’s geopolitical rise.</p>



<p>But then came the interesting part. “Since the beginning of this year, I have said on many occasions that we must promote the formation of a new development pattern, in which domestic and international cycles are the mainstay, and the domestic and international dual cycles promote each other,” Xi said. To an outsider, this might seem unremarkable, cloaked as it is in the elliptical phraseology that often marks Chinese economic ideas. But the “dual circulation” strategy Xi outlined actually represents a radical new understanding of globalization and of China’s place within it.</p>



<p>More than just a buzzword, dual circulation describes the deeply pessimistic worldview that has settled over Beijing. Once China’s leaders saw opportunity in globalization. Now, they expect the U.S. and its allies to deny China the technology it needs to build “a modern socialist country” by mid-century, meaning a wealthy superpower fit to rival the U.S. Although likely to be less pugilistic, Beijing rightly believes an incoming Biden administration will also press forward with policies designed to stop advanced technologies finding their way into Beijing’s hands. Chinese thinking has long valorized self-reliance, dating back to ideas developed by former Chinese leader Mao Zedong during the country’s civil war, which ended with the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Now, Trump’s tariffs, as well as his campaigns against companies like Huawei and TikTok, have given new impetus to the modern form of self-reliance Xi dubs “internal” development.</p>



<p>Many experts have noted a changing Western consensus on China, as leaders in Washington abandoned the idea that economic modernization would inevitably lead to political liberalization in Beijing. But there has been a comparable shift in China’s internal conversation on the West too. Beginning with semiconductors but potentially expanding to all manner of other areas, China now expects it will have to develop technologically on its own. Xi’s new theory now sits at the heart of the country’s <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-10/29/c_139476451.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">14th five-year plan</a>, which covers development from 2021 to 2025, and was unveiled in draft form in October. The result will accelerate China’s decoupling from the West, while also increasing the importance of trading links forged with other parts of the world — for instance, via Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Put more bluntly, while the world was distracted by the drama of the U.S. presidential election, Xi quietly unveiled an economic strategy fit for a new Cold War. Both for China and for globalization itself, the results are likely to be profound.&nbsp;</p>

      “China expects the U.S. and its allies to act ever more aggressively to deny China the technology it needs.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<hr>



<p>To see how much China’s consensus has changed, recall Xi’s <a href="https://america.cgtn.com/2017/01/17/full-text-of-xi-jinping-keynote-at-the-world-economic-forum" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">remarks</a> at Davos in 2017. There, he portrayed globalization not as a threat, but as an inevitability. “The global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from,” he suggested. “China will vigorously foster an external environment of opening-up for common development.” Just as Trump was turning against the idea, China would act as steward of the existing global order. It would even help to remedy many of the problems that rapid integration had caused, Xi argued, from economic inequality to climate change.</p>



<p>Three years later and, under <a href="https://research.nus.edu.sg/eai/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/EAIC-20-20201020.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">dual circulation</a>, things look much different. The idea splits the world into two systems. First comes external circulation, meaning China’s global trade, but also the way it invites foreigners into its domestic economy. This was the focus of Xi’s Davos remarks and the approach that powered his country’s decades of rapid growth, transforming China into an exporting powerhouse. The second component is then internal circulation, meaning domestic demand from Chinese consumers, but also domestic supply chains and “made in China” technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This division shares something in common with “<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/40-years-of-china-opening-up" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">reform and opening up</a>,” a phrase that has dominated China’s economic thinking for decades. That idea suggested Beijing should reform its domestic (or internal) economy to make it more market-led, while also opening up to the (external) world via globalization, gaining new ideas, production techniques and technologies along the way. Dual circulation also echoes longstanding attempts to wean China off a growth model dominated by exports and infrastructure investment and build instead the kind of consumption-led economy common in rich countries.</p>



<p>Such attempts have been only partially successful. A decade ago, about <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China's%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,an%20average%20share%20of%2049.7%20%25." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">34%</a> of China’s economy came via domestic consumption, less than <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/final-consumption-expenditure-etc-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html#:~:text=(%25%20of%20GDP)%20in%20United,compiled%20from%20officially%20recognized%20sources." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">half the level</a> in the U.S. at the time. By 2019, this has reached just <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China%20Private%20Consumption%3A%20%25%20of%20GDP,-1952%20%2D%202019%20%7C%20Yearly&amp;text=China%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,an%20average%20share%20of%2049.7%20%25." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">39%</a> — progress, of a sort, but hardly dramatic. When the phrase dual circulation first emerged earlier this year, many saw it as merely yet one more push toward this long-term objective of Chinese internal economic rebalancing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is China’s deteriorating geopolitical environment that marks dual circulation as a decisive break from the past, however. “China thinks there is a good prospect of even worse relations with the U.S. and its friends in the coming years,” I was told recently by Li Mingjiang, a Chinese political scientist based in Singapore and long-time observer of Beijing’s intricate political economy. “So, it needs to do something about it.”</p>



<p>It is not hard to see why. Trump’s tariffs and battles over soybeans generated more headlines, but it is advanced technology that really matters in Beijing. China is a global tech leader in some sectors, from online payments to artificial intelligence. But it lags in others. Despite its geopolitical heft, it still remains a firmly middle-income economy, with a gross domestic product per capita of roughly <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=china+gdp+per+capita&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;oq=china+gdp&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i67l3j0j69i60j69i61.4682j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">$9,700</a> — about on par with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03pfVp34z407DFWSFnQvjkGHb2akQ%3A1605820539834&amp;ei=e-C2X7m2Munfz7sP5ZGlgAE&amp;q=kazakhstan+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=Ka+gdp+per+capita&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQoaoBWMmrAWCUswFoAHADeAGAAesBiAGeApIBBTEuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Kazakhstan</a> and roughly half that of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03pfVp34z407DFWSFnQvjkGHb2akQ%3A1605820539834&amp;ei=e-C2X7m2Munfz7sP5ZGlgAE&amp;q=kazakhstan+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=Ka+gdp+per+capita&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQoaoBWMmrAWCUswFoAHADeAGAAesBiAGeApIBBTEuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Greece</a>. Access to cutting-edge technology is critical in changing this, especially as its economy moves away from the kind of basic exported manufactured goods that have long dominated its growth model.</p>



<p>Over recent decades, China has had many routes to acquiring such technology. Often, it simply bought it, as when Chinese companies snapped up everything from Rolls Royce jet engines to Qualcomm semiconductors. Foreign businesses rushed to set up Chinese operations, often as part of local joint ventures, eager to tap into a vast consumer market. Chinese businesses bought foreign technology groups, while Chinese academics and scientists built partnerships at the world’s best universities. Beijing <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/getting-beyond-forced-technology-transfers-analysis-and-recommendations-intangible" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">employed</a> darker methods too, from forced technology transfer to outright intellectual property theft. But there were always plenty of legitimate avenues to go with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, many of these routes are closing fast. Rather than tariffs, America’s “entity list” has proved its most potent weapon. Back in 2016, President Barack Obama first used this process in <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/getting-beyond-forced-technology-transfers-analysis-and-recommendations-intangible" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">accusing</a> ZTE, China’s second-largest telecoms supplier, of selling U.S. technologies to Iran, crippling the Chinese company in the process. Trump then escalated this approach, banning U.S. businesses from trading with dozens of Chinese enterprises, from state-owned giants to niche artificial intelligence providers with links to Xinjiang and its embattled Muslim Uighur minority. More recent <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/08/commerce-department-further-restricts-huawei-access-us-technology-and" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">measures</a> unveiled this August hit foreign suppliers too, for instance stopping semiconductor operators in Taiwan from selling to Chinese entities. Huawei has been one high-profile victim, leading experts to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdd2a70f-ecd2-4aff-b6c7-c0624bfdeebb" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">question</a> whether China’s state-linked tech champion can survive.</p>



<p>What started with semiconductors is unlikely to end there, however, hence dual circulation’s underlying pessimism. Under Trump, the U.S. has unveiled a range of further measures limiting China’s technology access, from its 2018 <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/briefings/2018/02/the_export_controlreformactof2018risksan.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Export Control Reform Act</a> to more targeted measures in areas like geospatial imagery software. Allies in Europe are being cajoled to follow suit. Many Western governments have also acted to stop China from buying up advanced tech companies entirely, while also <a href="https://www.chinacenter.net/2020/china_currents/19-3/scholars-or-spies-u-s-china-tension-in-academic-collaboration/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">limiting</a> academic collaborations with Chinese partners. The recent battle over TikTok was illustrative too, showing how rapidly the U.S. has lowered the bar on what counts as a national security threat, a category that now includes not just critical 5G telecoms architecture of the sort provided by Huawei, but also jocular teenage social media platforms.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, U.S. strategists are particularly vexed by China’s doctrine of “<a href="https://www.floridadaily.com/marco-rubio-introduces-bill-to-keep-chinese-military-companies-from-accessing-american-capital-markets/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">military-civil fusion</a>,” which mandates that technologies acquired by China’s private sector must be shared with its armed forces. The problem is that, when you look hard enough, almost anything can potentially be seen as a dual-use technology, from nuclear equipment and renewable energy batteries to civilian aircraft, drones and autonomous vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As we noted above, the primary goal of OSv is to run existing Linux software, because most MIKELANGELO use cases required running existing code. Today’s Linux APIs – POSIX system calls, socket API, etc. – were formed by decades of Unix and Linux legacy, and some aspects of them are inherently inefficient. OSv can improve the performance of applications which use these APIs, but not dramatically. So our second goal in the development of the guest operating system was to propose new APIs which will offer new applications dramatically better performance than unmodified Linux applications – provided that the application is rewritten to use these new APIs,</p>
<p>In the research paper “OSv — Optimizing the Operating System for Virtual Machines”[<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>], one of the benchmarks used was Memcached, a popular cloud application used for caching of frequently requested objects to lower the load on slower database servers. Memcached demonstrated how an unmodified network application can run faster on OSv than it does on Linux – a 22% speedup was reported in the paper.</p>
<p>22% is a nice speedup that we get just by replacing Linux in the guest by OSv, without modifying the application at all. But we wanted to understand if there is something we could do to get significantly higher performance. When we profiled memcached on OSv, we quickly discovered two performance bottlenecks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inefficiencies inherent in the Posix API</strong>, so OSv cannot avoid them and still remain POSIX compatible: For example, in one benchmark we noticed that 20% of the memcached runtime was locking and unlocking mutexes – almost always uncontended. For every packet we send or receive, we lock and unlock more than a dozen mutexes. Part of OSv’s performance advantage over Linux is that OSv uses a “netchannel” design for the network stack reducing locks (see the previous section), but we still have too many of them, and the Posix API forces us to leave many of them: For example, the Posix API allows many threads to use the same socket, allows many threads to modify the list of file descriptors, to poll the same file descriptors – so all these critical operations involve locks, that we cannot avoid. The socket API is also synchronous, meaning that when a send() returns the caller is allowed to modify the buffer, which forces the network code in OSv to not be zero-copy.</li>
<li><strong>Unscalable application design: </strong>It is not easy to write an application to scale linearly in the number of cores in a multi-core machine, and many applications that work well on one or two cores, scale very badly to many cores. For example memcached keeps some global statistics (e.g., the number of requests served) and updates it under a lock – which becomes a major bottleneck when the number of cores grow. What might seem like an acceptable solution – lock-free atomic variables – is also not scalable, because while no mutex is involved, atomic operations, and the <em>cache line bounces </em>(as different CPUs read and write the same variable), both become slower as the number of cores increase. So writing a really scalable application – one which can run on (for example) 64 cores and run close to 64 times faster than it does on a single core – is a big challenge and most applications are not as scalable as they should be – which will become more and more noticeable as the number of cores per machine continues to increase.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the aforementioned OSv paper, we tried an experiment to quantify the first effect – the inefficiency of the Posix API. The subset of memcached needed for the benchmark was very simple: a request is a single packet (UDP), containing a “GET” or “PUT” command, and the result is a single UDP packet as well. So we implemented in OSv a simple “packet filter” API: every incoming ethernet packet gets processed by a function (memcached’s hash-table lookup) which immediately creates the response packet. There is no additional network stack, no locks or atomic operations (we ran this on a single CPU), no file descriptors, etc. The performance of this implementation was an impressive 4 times better than the original memcached server.</p>
<p>But while the simple “packet filter” API was useful for the trivial UDP memcached, it was not useful for implementing more complex applications, for example applications which are asynchronous (cannot generate a response immediately from one request packet), use TCP or need to use multiple cores. Fast “packet filter”-like APIs are already quite commonly used (DPDK is a popular example) and are excellent to implement routers and similar packet-processing software; But they are not really helpful if you try to write a complex, highly-asynchronous network applications of the kind that is often used on the cloud – such as a NoSQL database, HTTP server, search engine, and so on.</p>
<p>For the MIKELANGELO project, we set out to design a new API which could answer both above requirements: An API which new applications can use to achieve optimal performance (i.e., the same level of performance achieved by the “packet filtering API” implementation), while at the same time allows the creation of complex real-life applications: The result of this design is <em>Seastar</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seastar is a C++14 library, which can be used on both OSv and Linux. Because Seastar bypasses the kernel for most things, we do not expect additional speed improvements by running it on OSv – though some of OSv’s other advantages (such as image size and boot time) may still be relevant.</li>
<li>Seastar is designed for the needs of complex asynchronous server applications of the type common on the cloud – e.g., NoSQL databases, HTTP servers, etc. Here “asynchronous” means that a request usually triggers a cascade of events (disk reads, communication with other nodes, etc.) and only at a later time can the reply be composed.</li>
<li>Seastar provides the application the mechanisms it needs to solve both performance bottlenecks mentioned at the top of this section: Achieve optimal efficiency on one core, as well as scalability in the number of cores. We’ll explain how Seastar does this below.</li>
<li>Seastar can bypass the legacy kernel APIs, e.g., it can directly access the network card directly using DPDK. Seastar provides a full TCP/IP stack (which DPDK does not).</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve reimplemented memcached using Seastar, and measured 2 to 4-fold performance improvement over the original memcached as well as near-perfect scalability to 32 cores (something which the “packet filter” implementation couldn’t do). Figure below for more details.</p>

<p>Applications that want to use Seastar will need to be rewritten to use its new (and very different) APIs. This requires significant investment, but also comes with significant rewards: The creator of the Seastar library, ScyllaDB, spent the last two years reimplementing the popular Cassandra distributed database in C++ and Seastar, and the result, “Scylla” (which, like Seastar and OSv, is released as open source[<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a>]), has much higher throughput than Cassandra: Independent benchmarks[<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>] by Samsung showed Scylla to have between 10 to 37 times higher throughput than Cassandra on a cluster of 24-core machines in different workloads,&nbsp; In fact, the Scylla distributed database performs so well that it has become ScyllaDB’s main product, making the company highly dependent on Seastar’s exploitation. For this reason, ScylllaDB has been investing into Seastar additional efforts beyond what is being funded by the MIKELANGELO project, and plans to continue developing Seastar even after the project ends.</p>
<p>We use Scylla, the Seastar-based reimplementation of Cassandra, in the “Cloud Bursting” use case. But our goal is for Seastar to be a general-purpose APIs which will be useful to many kinds of asynchronous server applications, which are often run on the cloud. As such, we are making an effort of providing a rich, well-balanced, and well documented API, and also writing a tutorial on writing Seastar applications (a draft of which was already included in D4.4 and D4.5). At the time of this writing, we know of at least two other companies besides ScyllaDB which based their product on Seastar, and more are considering doing this.</p>
<h2>Seastar architecture</h2>
<p>How can an application designed to use Seastar be so much faster than one using more traditional APIs such as threads, shared memory and sockets? The short answer is that modern computer architecture has several performance traps that are easy to fall into, and Seastar ensures that you don’t by using the following architecture:</p>
<ol>

<p>Modern multi-core machines have shared memory, but using it incorrectly can drastically reduce an application’s performance: Locks are very slow, and so are processor-provided “lock-free” atomic operations and memory fences. Reading and writing the same memory object from different cores significantly slows down processing compared to one core finding the object in its cache (this phenomenon is known as “cache line bouncing”). All of these slow operations already hurt one-core performance, but get progressively slower as the number of cores increases, so it also hurts the scaling of the application to many cores.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the number of cores increases, multi-core machines inevitably become multi-socket, and we start seeing NUMA (non-uniform memory access) issues. I.e., some cores are closer to some parts of memory – and accessing the …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, ch. 7.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Active Listening</em>:<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
<a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/active-listening.pdf">Active Listening</a>, p. 2</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Similarly, advice and information are almost always seen as efforts to change a person and thus serve as barriers to his self-expression and the development of a creative relationship.</p></blockquote><p>You can find similar advice in most books on relationships, people management, etc.</p><p>This always used to seem silly to me. If I complain at my partner and she “just listens,” I’ve accomplished nothing except maybe made her empathetically sad. When I complain at people, I want <em>results</em>, not to grouse into the void!<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
Empirically, I did notice that I usually got better results from listening than from giving advice. So I inferred that this advice was true for other people, but not me, because other people didn’t actually want to fix their problems.</span></span></sup></p><p>Frequently the “just listen” advice comes with tactical tips, like “reflect what people said back to you to prove that you’re listening.” For instance, consider these example dialogues from <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>:<sup><label for="sn3">§</label><span><span><sup>§</sup>
<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, Chapter 7, Exercise 5.5, 5.6 and solutions.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?</p><p>Person B: Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked me to agree to do what you requested?</p></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><p>Person A: I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him.</p><p>Person B: So you’re feeling furious because you would like him to be around more than he is?</p></blockquote><p>I say this with great respect for <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, but these sound like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">1970s-era chatbot</a>. If I were Person A in either of these dialogues my next line would be “yes, you dingbat—can you turn the nonviolence down a couple notches?” I’d feel alienated knowing that someone is going through their NVC checklist on me.</p><hr><p>Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners <em>do</em> often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" target="_blank">cargo cult advice</a>: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what’s actually important, the thing that’s <em>generating</em> that surface appearance.</p><p>The generator is curiosity.</p><p>When I’ve listened the most effectively to people, it’s because I was intensely curious—I was trying to build a <em>detailed, precise</em> understanding of what was going on in their head. When a friend says, “I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him,” that one sentence has a huge amount underneath. How often does she need him? What does she need him for? Why isn’t he around? Have they talked about it? If so, what did he say? If not, why not?</p><p>It turns out that <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding" target="_blank">open it up and see the gears inside</a>. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.</p><p>Some stories from recent memory:</p><ul><li><p>When we started doing a pair programming rotation at Wave, I suggested that, to make scheduling easier, we designate a default time when pairing sessions would happen. A coworker objected that this seemed authoritarian. I was extremely puzzled, but they’d previously mentioned being an anarchist, so I was tempted to just chalk it up to a political disagreement and move on. But instead I tried to get curious and explore more deeply whatever “political” models were generating that disagreement. After a lot of digging into what was or wasn’t authoritarian for them and why, it turned out the disagreement was because they’d missed the word “default” and thought I was suggesting a single <em>mandatory</em> time for pair programming.</p></li><li><p>My partner, Eve, wrote a post about Polish attitudes about sex, with some details that upset her (Polish) parents. When her parents told her that, she initially got very stressed about having to have a conversation to calm them down. I thought she shouldn’t be worried and the conversation would be fine, but of course just telling her that wasn’t very helpful. Instead, I summoned up my curiosity and asked lots of questions about her relationship with her parents, her parents’ relationship with each other, each of their relationships with Catholicism, etc. By the end of the conversation, after thinking through all the baggage involved, Eve agreed with me, and her attitude about the upcoming conversation shifted from impending doom to compassionate curiosity about where her parents were coming from.</p></li><li><p>I was stressed by work and complained to Eve about some things that I felt frustrated and stuck about. Instead of suggesting solutions, she kept asking for more details until she had more or less a complete snapshot of my mental state. At that point, she observed that every time I mentioned feeling sad, I sounded contemptuous and exasperated with myself. She hypothesized that I wasn’t giving myself permission to be sad. The “solution” to my problem ended up being to give me a big hug and let me cry on her shoulder for a bit, after which I immediately felt much less stressed.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the “helper” tried to learn about the “complainer’s” reality in as much detail as possible—not just the problem, but the whole person and whatever else was behind the immediate issue. And that’s what made it possible for them to actually help.</p><p>It often feels like I understand enough to be helpful without knowing all those details. But when I think that, I’m usually wrong: I end up giving bad advice, based on bad assumptions, and the person I’m talking to ends up having to do a bunch of work to argue with me and correct my bad assumptions. That makes the conversation feel disfluent and adversarial instead of collaborative.</p><p>It turns out this is a really common failure mode of helping-conversations, which is what I think generates the old saw at the beginning of this post, that “sometimes people don’t want help, just to be listened to.”</p><p>But I think that’s actually too nice to the helper, and uncharitable to the complainer (in that it assumes they weirdly don’t care about solving their problem). What’s really going on is probably that your advice is bad, because you didn’t really listen, because you weren’t curious enough.</p><hr><p>When I’m curious about what someone’s saying, I often do repeat things back to them in my own words. But it’s because I’m genuinely curious, not because I’m checking off the “reflect words” box in my “be a good listener” checklist. That means I do it in a way that sounds like my natural speech, instead of mimicking them like a chatbot.</p><p>When done this way, reflective listening feels validating rather than alienating. It’s a way of demonstrating that I care a lot about what someone has to say. Putting their idea into my own words shows them that I’ve fully digested it, and helps us establish a shared language in which to talk about it. That, in turn, makes the conversation fluent and collaborative, rather than a zigzag of bad assumptions and corrections.</p><p>So the right advice isn’t “listen harder and repeat everything back”—you won’t be genuine if you’re just imitating the surface appearance of a good listener. Instead, be humble and get curious! Remind yourself that there’s a ton of detail behind whatever you’re hearing, and try to internalize all of it that you can. Once you’ve done that, your advice will be more likely hit the mark, and you’ll be able to communicate it clearly.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>To start: yes, long time no see. Well, COVID-19 has been like that. Some days I
feel accomplished if I successfully check my email. I finally managed to clear
out a backlog of an entire handfull of things that needed thoughtful responses,
though, and so here I am, screaming into the void instead of at anyone in
particular.</p>
<p>That said, let's talk a bit about radios. It is probably unsurprising by now
that I have a long-running interest in radio and especially digital radio
communications---but people who come to radio from all kinds of different
perspectives run into one odd problem: the curious refusal of any receiver
to tune to certain frequencies in the 800-900MHz range.</p>
<p>A lot of people have a general knowledge that this has to do with some kind of
legal prohibition on reception of cellular phones. That's roughly correct, but
to fully explain the matter requires going into some depth on two different
topics: FCC regulation of radio devices, and the development of cellular
phones. The first sounds more boring, so let's hit that one first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most electronic products manufactured or imported into the
United States are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission. Specifically, they generally require an "Equipment Authorization"
from the FCC prior to being marketed. For purposes of this regulatory scheme,
electronic devices can be broadly divided into two categories: intentional
radiators and unintentional radiators.</p>
<p>An intentional radiator is something that is specifically intended to broadcast
a radio signal, like, say, a cellular phone. Intentional radiators must be
certified to comply with the specific Part of the FCC regulations relevant to
the service for which they will be used. For example, cellular phones must be
certified against Part 27, Wireless Communications Service, among others. The
exact process varies by the part and can be involved, but it generally
involves the manufacturer paying a certified test lab to perform certain tests
and complying with various other filing requirements which include placing a
label on the device which specifies its FCC approval. Device manufacturers
must file with the FCC a description of how this label will appear before they
receive approval to market the device, which is why the rough designs of
unreleased devices are sometimes revealed by the rough drawings in these
filings---tech journalists will watch these to get the dimensions of new
iPhones, for example.</p>
<p>By the way, when I say the "FCC Regulations," if you want to follow along at
home these are promulgated as 47 CFR. So Part 27, for example, refers to 47 CFR
27. The ever lovely Cornell LII has the whole thing for your entertainment:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47. There's some reading for when you need
help falling asleep.</p>
<p>But that's all besides the point, I'm more interested in talking about
unintentional radiators, devices which are not intended to produce RF radiation
but may still do so as a result of the operation of the electronics---this is
generally called a spurious emission, which is basically any RF emitted by
accident. These devices are certified under Part 15 of the FCC regulations[1],
and so are sometimes called "Part 15 devices." Part 15 essentially limits the
type and amplitude of spurious emissions to prevent random devices causing
harmful interference due to defects in their designs.</p>
<p>What would we call a radio <em>receiver</em>, then? It is explicitly a radio device,
but is not intended to transmit anything. As a result, radio receivers are Part
15 devices. Most of Part 15 is very general and doesn't really say anything
specific about radio devices, it just limits spurious emissions and other
design standards. However, 15.121 gets a great deal more specific in
discussing "Scanning receivers.' A scanning receiver is specifically defined
earlier in the regulation as a device capable of tuning to two or more frequency
bands in the range of 30-960Mhz. This has the fun result that nothing for the
GHz range is technically a scanner, but for practical reasons this doesn't
matter too much.</p>
<p>So what's in 15.121? This is:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(a): ... scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or
marketed for use with scanning receivers, shall: (1) Be incapable of operating
(tuning), or readily being altered by the user to operate, within the frequency
bands allocated to the Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this
chapter (cellular telephone bands). ... (b) Be designed so that the tuning,
control and filtering circuitry is inaccessible. The design must be such that
any attempts to modify the equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular
Radiotelephone Service likely will render the receiver inoperable. </p>
<p>The rest of paragraph (a) gives a pretty long clarification of "readily being
altered by the user," and it's amusing to think of a bunch of FCC characters
sitting around a table trying to think up every alteration that is easy.
Jumper wires and reprogramming micro-controllers are both right out.</p>
<p>It gets even better:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(b): ... scanning receivers shall reject any signals from the
Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based
upon a 12 dB SINAD measurement, which is considered the threshold where a
signal can be clearly discerned from any interference that may be present. </p>
<p>So, here's this actual weird rule about scanners. Scanners are specifically
prohibited from being able to tune to any bands allocated to the Part 22
Cellular Radiotelephone Service. This raises questions, and as you can imagine
from the way I got here, I am about to spend a long time answering them.</p>
<p>When the FCC says "Cellular Radiotelephone Service," they aren't talking about
cell phones in general. The CRS as I'll call it refers to a <em>very specific</em>
cellular service, and that is AMPS.</p>
<p>AMPS, the Advanced Mobile Phone System, is the most common in the US of the
"1G" cellular services. Most carriers that were around when it was offered
called it "Analog" service, and indeed, AMPS was entirely analog. And, due to
an odd detail of the regulation, large cellular carriers were <em>required</em> to
offer AMPS service until 2008, long after AMPS phones were no longer produced.
You may have had a candy bar phone back when you would occasionally see an "A"
for analog service, but I hope not into the late 2000s.</p>
<p>There are a few things that we might infer from AMPS being an analog service.
One of those things is that it probably did not employ strong encryption. In
fact, AMPS employed no scrambling or enciphering of any kind. Your phone
conversations were just flapping in the wind for anyone to hear. This posed a
major practical problem for carriers in the '90s as it was discovered that it
was not particularly difficult to intercept the call setup process from an AMPS
phone and swipe its identification numbers, allowing you to basically steal
someone else's cellular service. You can imagine that this was popular with
certain criminals with a need for untraceable but convenient communications.</p>
<p>There was also a problem for consumers: their phone conversations could be
fairly easily overheard. There were a number of ways to do this, using any
radio scanner that covered that band for example. One particularly well-known
option was a particular model of phone, the Oki 900, that had an unusually
open design (in terms of modifiability) that led to reverse engineered and
modified firmware being developed that made eavesdropping on other people's
calls just, well, a feature it had.</p>
<p>The scale of this problem was fairly large, and it was fairly well known. For
example, let's turn to <em>my</em> favorite source of late-night reading, newspaper
archives. A lovely piece in the 30 May 1990 issue of The News and Observer,
from Raleigh NC, takes the cheesy headline "Monitoring Megahertz" and goes
into some depth on the issue.</p>
<p>"I've heard men call their wives and tell them they'll be home late, then call
their girl friends," quipped one electronics store owner who had "accidentally"
eavesdropped on cellular calls using a scanner. We've all fat-fingered our
ways into someone else's affairs I'm sure, pun intended. Another person said
"when you look at the fact that there are how many thousands of people out
there who know my name, my mailing address and my salary...I put cellular
eavesdropping down as being no different from that." In the face of technology,
even in 1990, people had begun to abandon their privacy.</p>
<p>Cellular carriers were not so happy about this, viewing it as an embarrassment
to their operation. I have heard before that cellular carriers went so far as
to lobby for banning scanners entirely, although I am not aware of much hard
evidence of this. What they did do was convince congress to stick an extra few
paragraphs onto an otherwise only tangentially related bit of legislation
called the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992. This has
largely to do with abusive 1-900 numbers, which is its whole own topic in
telephone regulation that I ought to take on sometime. But it also brought
along just a bit more, an extra section that was subsequently amended several
times at the behest of cellular carriers. Let's read part of it, as amended,
and with some editing for readability.</p>
<p>The Commission shall prescribe and make effective regulations denying equipment
authorization for any scanning receiver that is capable of---(A) receiving
transmissions in the frequencies allocated to the domestic cellular radio
telecommunications service, (B) readily being altered by the user to receive
transmissions in such frequencies, or (C) being equipped with decoders that
convert digital cellular transmissions to analog voice audio.</p>
<p>Well, we've made it full circle: we've seen the regulation, and we've seen the
legislation that kicked the FCC to write the regulation. But how does this
translate today? Things get a bit weird there.</p>
<p>You see, the FCC seems to have (sensibly) …</p></article></div>
