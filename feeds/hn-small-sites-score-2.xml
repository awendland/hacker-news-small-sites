<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you use git on the command line you might have used the message flag (<code>-m</code>). It allows developers to define commit messages inline when calling git commit. </p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "my commit message"</code></pre><p>I'm not the biggest fan of this approach because I prefer to edit the commit message in vim (which I only use for writing commit messages). It gives me the opportunity to double-check the files I'm committing.</p>
<p>Today I learned that the git commit command accepts multiple message flags. <span role="img" aria-label="Astonished Face" tabindex="0">😲</span></p>
<p>It turns out that you can use the <code>-m</code> option multiple times. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--mltmsggt">The git documentation</a> includes the following paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If multiple -m options are given, their values are concatenated as separate paragraphs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you run the following command</p>
<pre><code>git co -m "commit title" -m "commit description"</code></pre><p>it will result in this commit.</p>

<h3><span id="Https_Redirection_middleware"></span>Https Redirection middleware<span></span></h3>



<p>In asp.net core <a href="https://pradeeploganathan.com/http/https/">https </a>is enabled by default. The <a aria-label="HttpsRedirection middleware class  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/354cb18d6304b24063d460e0a41c6c1d51ea4000/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy/HttpsRedirectionMiddleware.cs#L139" target="_blank">HttpsRedirection middleware class </a>provides the necessary functionality to enforce redirection from http to https. The UseHttpsRedirection extension method in startup is used to enforce this. This extension method issues a 307 temporary redirect response by default. It then uses the configured https port to specify the redirection endpoint. If the https port is not specified in code, this class will get the https port from HTTPS_PORT environment variable or the IServerAddress feature. If either of them is not specified, then the middleware will log a warning and will not redirect. The code below shows an example of adding the https redirection middleware to the services collection and using it. The code below checks the environment and sets a permanent redirect to the HTTPS endpoint in production and a temporary redirect in development environment.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HTTPRedirection</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Development_certificates"></span>Development certificates<span></span></h3>



<p>To enable the use of HTTPS in the development environment, .net core provides a global tool that creates a self-signed certificate on the local environment. The following command can install this tool</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet tool install –global dotnet-dev-certs</p></blockquote>



<p>The tool can now be used to generate self-signed certificates with the following command. The -ep flag signifies the export path where the certificate will be exported and the -p flag signifies the password required to generate the certificate. We can use the –trust option to trust the certificate generated.</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet dev-certs https -ep &lt;path_to_certficate&gt;/certificate.pfx -p &lt;certificate_password&gt; </p><p>dotnet dev-certs https –trust</p></blockquote>



<p>On Linux/Mac OS we can use OpenSSL to generate the certificate for the local environment. Trusting the certificate is however a much more involved process depending on the version and flavor of the Linux OS.</p>



<blockquote><p>openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout dev-certificate.key -out dev-certificate.cer -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost<br>openssl pkcs12 -export -out dev-certificate.pfx -inkey dev-certificate.key -in dev-certificate.cer</p></blockquote>



<p>The certificate path can be specified using the environmental variable  ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path   &amp; the password using environment variable ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password </p>



<h3><span id="Kestrel_as_edge_server"></span>Kestrel as edge server<span></span></h3>



<p>Kestrel can be deployed either as an edge server or with a reverse proxy such as IIS, NGINIX or Apache.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png" alt="" srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" data-lazy-srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" data-lazy-src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Kestrel deployment scenarios</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Kestrel is deployed as a public facing edge server it can be configured to use https and a specific certificate and port using the below code</p>



<p><figcaption>Configuring Kestrel as edge server</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Terminating_TLS_at_a_Reverse_proxy"></span>Terminating TLS at a Reverse proxy<span></span></h3>



<p>If a reverse proxy such as Apache or NGNIX is used, then the forwarded headers middleware should be configured and setup before calling the Https redirection middleware. The forwarded headers middleware should set the X-Forwarded-Proto to https. This will enable https offloading at the proxy and a plain http call to the web application with a guarantee that the original call was made over a secure https channel. This is critical especially in non-IIS scenarios such as NGINIX or Apache.  See the code below to configure the forwarded headers middleware</p>



<p><figcaption>Forwarded headers from a reverse proxy</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_in_containerized_environment"></span>HTTPS in containerized environment<span></span></h3>



<p>In a containerized environment an option is to generate the certificates as part of container creation or startup and specify the same in the docker compose file. The environment files can then be used to configure the necessary environment variables as below</p>



<p><figcaption>Using certificates in a docker volume </figcaption></p>



<p>The corresponding environment files to specify the necessary environment variables are below</p>



<p><figcaption>using environment variables in docker to specify certificate path</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_strict_transport_security_(HSTS)"></span>HTTPS strict transport security (HSTS)<span></span></h3>



<p>Using HTTPS redirection still presents a minor security risk as the user can make an initial request using HTTP before being redirected to a secure HTTPS connection. To overcome this the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Protocol adds a header in responses indicating that only HTTPS should be used when sending requests to the web endpoint. Once an HSTS header has been received, clients that support the HSTS protocol will always send requests to the application using HTTPS even if the user specifies an HTTP URL. In .NET Core 3.1, We can add the HSTS middleware to the pipeline as below.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HSTS</figcaption></p>



<p>In the above code we are specifying HSTS preload to be set to true. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chromium.org/hsts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HSTS preloading</a> is a function built into the browser whereby a global list of hosts enforces the use of HTTPS ONLY on their site. The domains are hard coded into the browser, which avoids the initial insecure request and ensures that only HTTPS is used. Another crucial point that trips up a lot of folks is that the HSTS header is not set even if you specify the use of HSTS middleware for localhost and the loopback address for IPV6 and IPV4. This is because the ExcludeHosts parameter by default excludes these addresses.</p>



<p>In summary .NET core provides a lot of ways to configure https for web applications with Kestrel as an edge server or through SSL offloading/TLS termination. It also provides for options to configure the same through code or through configuration or using a docker compose file.</p>

<div>
<p>… or it took a while to get here 😀</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>This project is fully lead by Willy/Lamers with my minor participation.</p>
<p>It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible.</p>
<p>Willy started working on it in his spare-time six years ago. The project goals were simple.</p>
<ul><li>small, smooth and not expensive design</li><li>reliable</li><li>quadrature encoder mouse support</li><li>easy to use and maintain</li><li>easy to personalize/configure</li><li>quick firmware upgrade</li></ul>
<p>The project came about quite quickly and Willy ordered the first batch. Unfortunately, It met almost all conditions but one – reliability. The design was based on the FTDI Vinculum2 chip. Although the layout is not bad, the toolchain is terribly underdeveloped (at least it was at that time). There were memory leaks all over the place, debugging was almost impossible, mainly due to the processor for which there is no documentation. In addition, the configuration saved from time to time destroyed the config itself …<br>It was too much. The project has been abandoned. If you are a strong-willed person you can try it yourself. All work that was done on it, is accessible <a href="http://jil.guru/16bit/projects/abbannddonnedd/hid2st.rar">HERE</a>. You can view or use it if you have the energy to break through the unfinished, wrong and undocumented code</p>
<h4>The new hope</h4>
<p>In the meantime, the design was repeatedly unearthed from a drawer, but unfortunately without much effect. Some of the original goals turned out to be impossible to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up to <a href="http://sillyventure.eu/pl/">Silly Venture 2019</a> which turned out to be a breakthrough. the demand for a functional Atari ST adapter turned out to be quite large. The mouSTer project was born.</p>
<p>The project received a new name “The mouSTer” and <a href="http://www.ha.art.pl/wydawnictwo/autorzy/5334-piotr-kroll-mietniowski.html">Kroll</a> (translator required) became its godfather. I hope he doesn’t mind :). Kroll is the best tester of an Atari equipment around.</p>
<p>The project has gained a new shape and new strengths.</p>
<p>Some early prototype pics:</p>

<p>At the moment, the current size has been reduced to a minimum – DB9 plug size + USB-A socket</p>
<p>Below some highlights:</p>
<ul><li>it works with every mouse and with every Game USB pad</li><li>PS4 pad support – USB </li><li>config via USB flash drive – INI file + default config</li><li>config transfer via USB flash drive</li><li>firmware upgrade via USB flash drive (takes 3 seconds, of which 2 seconds is the time the bootloader needs to recognize the flash drive)</li><li>tested with flash drives from 32MB to 32GB</li><li>mouse emulation mode defaults – Amiga, Atari ST, joystick/gamepad</li></ul>
<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Finally, after a few months of testing in laboratory conditions, everything works rock-solid. Changing the firmware and configuration works confidently and is trouble-free.</p>

<p><br>What’s left to be done<mark id="annotation-text-c72ef339-eeed-462d-a5c9-61b4fb1fb90d"></mark>:</p>
<ul><li>making a test batch in the target size – closing the plant due to COVID19 did not help at all 🙁</li><li>configuration file tuning</li><li>creating a poly-urethane case</li><li>adding config options for Commodore 64/128, Spectrum, and every other possible retro machine.</li><li>PS4 pad full support for all platforms.</li><li>8-bit Atari will receive a special mode that will cover all the PS4 pad functions, mouse and other HID class devices</li><li>testing, testing, testing …</li></ul>
<p><strong>What has to be highlighted is that mouSTer started as an ATARI add-on but it aims to be multi-platform adapter!!</strong></p>

		<p>I have a confession to make: I can’t eat spicy food.</p>
<p>As a person of South Asian descent, it’s incongruous, I know. I’m left adrift with the certain type of person who orders food Indian spicy. While my dining companions make an effort to signal their identity as capsaicin-consuming, I wonder if I should order my food white-guy mild. It’s not like I don’t enjoy the stinging heat or the bleary-eyed trip of something made extra hot—it’s just that I can’t digest it.</p>

<p>I blame dysentery. A bout of it when I was three left two lasting effects on my life: it introduced me to my oldest friendship through a circuitous game of chance (a story for another time), and it rendered my digestive system subject to pains that feel like someone is reaching into me to wring out my guts like wet laundry.</p>
<p>I’m often told by well-meaning people how much they love Indian food, and then asked if I cook it at home. I never know quite how to respond. Does roti count—especially if it’s the buss-up shut <i>parāthā</i> of Trinidad? Where do Bihari staples like <i>sattū</i> (ground-up roasted gram) or <i>chōkha</i> (mashed and roasted eggplant) fit into this understanding? But their question isn’t an interrogation of the narrowness of national cuisines. Their question isn’t a question at all—it’s a chance to share. The woman who loves her corner Indian restaurant. The man who just took an Indian-cooking class through adult education. The reasons are usually the same: they love the heat, the fieriness, the spice.</p>
<p>All the things I’m doomed to avoid.</p>

<p>This all had me wondering: what’s Indian food without the heat? The historian in me has an answer: spiciness is historically contingent. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and the entire world changed: slavery, war, disease, colonization, and an immense transfer of wealth to Europe. And with that wealth too came New World nightshades—potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, peppers of all kinds. It took some time for these fruits and vegetables to plant themselves into European cuisine. The tomato, for example, wasn’t widely used in Italian cuisine until the eighteenth century.<span id="easy-footnote-1-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-69820" title="David Gentilecore, <i>Pomodoro! A History of the Tomato in Italy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 45–68."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But what about food further out from Europe? What about India?</p>
<p>Soon after Columbus’ first expedition, the treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa divided the oceans of the newly-known world. The Portuguese effectively took the Atlantic and Indian oceans, while the Spanish took the Pacific. With that, the Portuguese established forts and trading posts along India’s Malabar coast. In time, <i>aloo</i> (potato), <i>tamātar</i> (tomato), and <i>mirchī</i> (chilies) were available on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. Later, the English set up their first trading posts in India in the eastern Gangetic plain, bringing these same staples into North India.<span id="easy-footnote-2-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-69820" title="K.T. Achaya, <i>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</i> (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 225–27."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>So what was curry like before Columbus? Well, <i>curry</i> didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In these cases, I find it useful to consult my <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, the nineteenth-century dictionary of Anglo-Indian loan words. According to that source, curry comes from the Portuguese word <i>karil (caril)</i> via the Tamil word <i>kari</i> (sauce, relish for rice). In the sixteenth century, this was transliterated into English as caril, but by the 1680s entered English as <i>carrees</i>, perhaps from <i>caris</i>, an Anglicized plural form of the Portuguese.<span id="easy-footnote-3-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-69820" title="Sir Henry Yule, “Curry,” in <a href=&quot;https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/hobsonjobson_query.py?page=281&quot;><i>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive</i></a>, ed. William Crooke, B.A (London: J Murray, 1903), 281."><sup>3</sup></a></span> It’s a circle: I’m back to Tordesillas and Saragossa.</p>
<p>It looks like the curry too came after Columbus. And not only that: it’s a meaningless word in the context of daily life. Indian food is cipher, built upon a matrix of regionalism, religion, and caste. A Dalit from Mararashtra’s Marathwada region might mix bovine blood with <i>yesur</i> (a local spice mix) to make <i>lakuti</i>, while a Tamil Brahmin might mix eight spices with <i>tur dāl</i> and onions to make a <i>sambar</i>.<span id="easy-footnote-4-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-69820" title="Shahu Patole, <a href=&quot;http://www.expressfoodie.com/main-course/why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dalit-food/&quot;>“Why I Wrote a Book on Dalit Food,”</a> <i>Express Foodie</i>, September 10, 2016."><sup>4</sup></a></span> Beyond the hyper-regionalism is a blunt truth as well: there are actual words for the plethora of regional dishes that can be reduced to a curry.</p>
<p>Still, curry can be a somewhat useful concept. It’s an outsider’s perspective, a shorthand glossing over an entire subcontinent’s worth of food. It’s the type of concept that takes what it wants from the original, and mixes in whatever else is ready-to-hand.</p>
<p>I went to the source: the first example of a curry recipe found in a Western cookbook. Hannah Glasse’s 1747 <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> featured a recipe “To make a Currey the Indian way” alongside one “To make a Pellow the Indian way.”<span id="easy-footnote-5-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-69820" title="Hannah Glasse, <i>The Art of Cookery, New</i> (London: L. Wangford, 1777), 74."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="372" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=336%2C162&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=768%2C370&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1536%2C741&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=2048%2C987&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1170%2C564&amp;ssl=1 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Upon first glance, I can’t tell how this recipe differs from a fricasseed chicken. But it’s there: “an ounce of Turmerick [turmeric], a large spoonful of ginger and beaten pepper.” What makes this curry in an Indian way is not the chicken or the cream, but these three spices taken mixed together and served.</p>
<p>Before spicy came spice: the history of curry before Columbus is a history of spice. And so I wonder: what spices were used? In what quantities?</p>
<p>The best spice to help answer these questions might be asafetida (also spelled asafetida). Known in Hindi as <i>hīng</i>, it’s the dried resin taken from the root of the Ferula herb, and is used throughout Indian cuisine in nearly all Indian regions. When fried in oil, it adds a lovely umami flavor to any dish, one reminiscent of garlic or onions.</p>
<p>I’ve also known it as an extremely smelly spice.</p>

<p>I had never heard of it until I was an adult. Family lore says that my father hated the smell so much, he told my mother early in their marriage to keep it out of the spice cabinet forever. But it wasn’t just him—the smell has a noxious reputation across the world, going back centuries. The Portuguese physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta wrote in his sixteenth-century <i>Colóquios</i> that “the nastiest smell in the world for me is Assa-fetida [sic].” But he also wrote that “the thing most used throughout India, and in all parts of it, is that Assa-fetida.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-69820" title="Garcia da Orta, <i>Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India</i>, ed. Conde de Ficalho, trans. Sir Clements Markham, New Lisbon Edition (London: Henry Sotheran and Co, 1913), 44–45."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This was as true in the twelfth century as it was in the sixteenth. One of the earliest South Asian texts that featured non-medicinal recipes was the Sanskrit <i>Mānasollāsa</i>. Written in 1129 CE by Someshvara III, king of the Western Chalukya Empire in the western Deccan and South India, the book is an encyclopedic treatise on all aspects of life in his kingdom. One of those most common ingredients found in its chapter on the enjoyment of food is asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-7-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-69820" title="Colleen Taylor Sen, <i>Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India</i>, Overdrive (eBook) edition (London: Reaktion Books, 2015), chap. 7."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, his general practices or preparing meat dishes called for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>For getting good smell, dry coriander seeds, jeera, and hingu; for giving colour haridra; for good taste the powder of saindhvam, visvamarichim are sprinkled over the food and covered with a clean cloth and mixed slightly with oil.<span id="easy-footnote-8-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-69820" title="P. Arundhati, trans., <i>Royal Life in Mānasôllāsa</i> (New Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan, 1994), 120."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Various other recipes, including those for <i>dāl</i>, meat dishes, and fish were also spiced with asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-9-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>9</sup></a></span> My first inclination when I saw this was to question it: of course a king would spice his food. Spices were a luxury, and it goes without saying that a king could afford to command his kitchen to use whatever spices were available to him.</p>

<p>But a century prior to the publication of the <i>Mānasollāsa</i> came the <i>Lokopakara</i> (roughly translates to “For the benefit of the people”). Written in 1025 by the Jain scholar Chavundaraya II, the<i> Lokopakara</i> featured a section on cooking with a recipe for <i>dāl </i>that recommended a garnish of mustard, cumin seeds, asafetida, and curry leaves.<span id="easy-footnote-10-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Asafetida too made an appearance in recipes dating from the Sultanate era. From 1206 to 1526, a succession of Islamic dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate ruled northern India. Nasir ud-Din Shah, a ruler of the Malwa Sultanate (a breakaway state from one of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties) produced the <i>Ni’matnama</i> (“The Book of Delights”). The book contained some of the recipes loved by his father, the Sultan Ghiyath Shah. Interestingly enough, the book contains a handful of recipes considered rustic or common—food for the common folk.</p>
<p>One recommends to:</p>
<blockquote><p>take root vegetables and boil them well, then take them off and fry them in ghee flavoured with sesame and asafetida.</p>
<p>Add lime juice, salt and burned vegetable oil and mix it as explained above. Take some of it, flavor it and cook it.<span id="easy-footnote-11-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-69820" title="Norah M. Titley, ed., <i>The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights</i> (London: Routledge, 2004), 44–45."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how burned vegetable oil would taste, but I’m sure the asafetida would make up for it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Humble <i>hīng</i> too made an appearance in the royal accounts of the Mughals. The Mughal Emperor Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605. His court historian, Abu’l-Fazl ‘Allami, dutifully chronicled his reign in <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> (“Administration of Akbar”). The work remains a quintessential source for the workings of Akbar’s government. It also contains a repertoire of recipes. For example, a recipe for <i>bādinjān</i> (eggplant) asks for:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 s. [<i>sīr</i>, approximately 640 grams] rice; 1 ½ s. g’hí [ghee], 3 ¾ s. onions; ¼ s. ginger and lime juice; pepper and coriander seed, 5 m. [misqal, approximately 6 grams] of each; cloves, cardamums [cardamom], and assafoetida, each ½ m.<span id="easy-footnote-12-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-69820" title="Abu’l-Fazl ’Allami, <i>The Ain I Akbari</i>, trans. Henry Blochmann, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Rouse, 1873), 59."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, the recipe for eggplant lacks any mention of eggplant. But regardless, there it is: a half <i>misqal</i> of asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-13-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-69820" title="A unit of mass equal to 4.25 grams. Misqal is sometimes written as mithqāl."><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even the kitchens of the Mughal court were filled with the wondrous odors of <i>hīng</i>.</p>
<p>The history of curry before Columbus is truly a history of spice. There are, of course, more spices to find in the archives: turmeric, coriander, and cumin come to mind. These are spices that cross region and class, the staples thrown into the pot in meal after meal. But ubiquitous, smelly, resinous <i>hīng</i> gives a chance to take a peek into the flavors of Indian food prior to the Columbian exchange. Perhaps there should be a new way to order something, not Indian spicy, but Indian spiced, with plenty of asafetida. I’ll hold my nose and ask for a generous portion, just like all those food chroniclers over the past millennium.</p>

In this article I will demonstrate a method I have been utilizing for the past year, which enables you to play any BattlEye-protected game online without even having to install BattlEye.</p><p>BattlEye is dynamically loaded by the respective game on startup to initialize the software service (“BEService”) and kernel driver (“BEDaisy”). These two components are critical in ensuring the integrity of the game, but the most critical component by far is the usermode library (“BEClient”) that the game interacts with directly. This module exports two functions: <code>GetVer</code> and more importantly <code>Init</code>.</p><p>The <em>Init</em> routine is what the game will call, but this functionality has never been documented before, as people mostly focus on BEDaisy or their <a href="https://secret.club/tags#battleye">shellcode</a>. Most important routines in <em>BEClient</em>, including <em>Init</em>, are protected and virtualised by <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a>, which we are able to devirtualise and reverse engineer thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vtil-project">vtil</a> by secret club member <a href="https://secret.club/author/can1357">Can Boluk</a>, but the inner workings of <em>BEClient</em> is a topic for a later part of this series, so here is a quick summary.</p><p><em>Init</em> and its arguments have the following definitions:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)

    remove_peer_t remove_peer;
};
</code></pre><p>As seen, these are quite simple containers for interopability between the game and <em>BEClient</em>. <code>becl_game_data</code> is defined by the game and contains functions that <em>BEClient</em> needs to call (for example, send_packet) while <code>becl_be_data</code> is defined by <em>BEClient</em> and contains callbacks used by the game after initialisation (for example, received_packet). Note that these two structures slightly differ in some games that have special functionality, such as the recently introduced packet encryption in <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> that we’ve already <a href="https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html">cracked</a>. Older versions of BattlEye (DayZ, Arma, etc.) use a completely different approach with function pointer swap hooks to intercept traffic communication, and therefore these structures don’t apply.</p><p>A simple <em>Init</em> implementation would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_game_data<span>*</span> game_data,
                               battleye<span>::</span>becl_be_data<span>*</span> client_data)
{
    <span>// CACHE RELEVANT FUNCTIONS</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet    <span>=</span> game_data<span>-&gt;</span>send_packet;

    <span>// SETUP CLIENT STRUCTURE</span>
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>exit                   <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>exit;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>run                    <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>run;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>command                <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>command;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>received_packet        <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>received_packet;

    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>add_peer               <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>add_peer;
    client_data<span>-&gt;</span>remove_peer            <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>remove_peer;

    <span>return</span> battleye<span>::</span>instance_status<span>::</span>SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED;
}
</code></pre><p>This would allow our custom BattlEye client to receive packets sent from the game server’s <em>BEServer</em> module.</p><p>The function <code>received_packet</code> is by far the most important routine used by the game, as it handles incoming packets from the BattlEye server component. BattlEye communication is extremely simple compared to how important the integrity of it is. In recent versions of BattlEye, packets follow the same general structure:</p><pre><code><span>#pragma pack(push, 1)
</span><span>struct</span> <span>be_fragment</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> count;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> index;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet_header</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> id;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> sequence;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet</span> <span>:</span> be_packet_header
{
    <span>union</span> 
    {
        be_fragment fragment;

        <span>// DATA STARTS AT body[1] IF PACKET IS FRAGMENTED</span>
        <span>struct</span>
        {
            <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> no_fragmentation_flag;
            std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> body[<span>0</span>];
        };
    };
    <span>inline</span> <span>bool</span> fragmented()
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>!=</span> <span>0x00</span>;
    }
};
<span>#pragma pack(pop)
</span></code></pre><p>All packets have an identifier and a sequence number (which is used by the requests/response communication and the heartbeat). Requests and responses have a fragmentation mode which allows <em>BEServer</em> and <em>BEClient</em> to send packets in chunks of <code>0x400</code> bytes (seemingly arbitrary) instead of sending one big packet.</p><p>In the current iteration of BattlEye, the following packets are used for communication:</p><h3 id="init-00"> <a href="#init-00">INIT (<code>00</code>)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent to the <em>BEClient</em> module as soon as the connection with the game server has been established. This packet is only transmitted once, contains no data besides the packet id <code>00</code> and the response to this packet is simply <code>00 05</code>.</p><h3 id="start-02"> <a href="#start-02">START (‘02’)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent right after the ‘INIT’ packets have been exchanged, and contains the server-generated guid of the client. The response of this packet is simply the header: <code>02 00</code></p><h3 id="request-04--response-05"> <a href="#request-04--response-05">REQUEST (<code>04</code>) / RESPONSE (<code>05</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is sent from <em>BEServer</em> to <em>BEClient</em> to request (and in rare cases, simply transmit) data, and <em>BEClient</em> will send back data for that request using the <code>RESPONSE</code> packet type.</p><p>The first request contains crucial information such as service- and integration version, not responding to it will get you disconnected by the game server. Afterwards, requests are game specific.</p><h3 id="heartbeat-09"> <a href="#heartbeat-09">HEARTBEAT (<code>09</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is used by the <em>BEServer</em> module to ensure that the connection hasn’t been dropped. It is sent every 30 seconds using a sequential index, and if the client doesn’t respond with the same packet, the client is disconnected from the game server. This heartbeat packet is only three bytes long, with the sequential index used for synchronization being incremental and therefore easily emulated. An example heartbeat could be: <code>09 01 00</code>, which is the second heartbeat (sequence starts at zero) transmitted.</p><p>With this knowledge, it is possible by emulating the entire BattlEye anti-cheat with only two proprietary points of data: the responses for request sequence one and two. These can be intercepted using a tool such as wireshark and replayed as many times as you want for the respective game, because the packet encryption used by BattlEye is static and contextless.</p><p>Emulating the <code>INIT</code> packet is as stated simply responding with the sequence number five:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT<span>:</span>
{
    <span>auto</span> info_packet <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>be_packet{};
    info_packet.id       <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT;
    info_packet.sequence <span>=</span> <span>0x05</span>;

    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(<span>&amp;</span>info_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(info_packet));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>START</code> packet is done by replying with the received packet’s header:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>START<span>:</span>
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>HEARTBEAT</code> packets is done by replying with the received packet:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>HEARTBEAT<span>:</span>    
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, length);
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>REQUEST</code> packets can be done by replaying previously generated responses, which can be logged with code hooks or man-in-the-middle software. These packets are game specific and some games might disconnect you for not handling a specific request, but most games only require the first two requests to be handled, afterwards simply replying with the packet header is enough to not get disconnected by the game server. It is important to notice that all <code>REQUEST</code> packets are immediately responded to with the header, to let the server know that the client is aware of the request. This is how BottlEye emulates them:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>REQUEST<span>:</span>
{
    <span>// IF NOT FRAGMENTED RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, ELSE ONLY RESPOND TO THE LAST FRAGMENT</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> respond <span>=</span> 
        <span>!</span>header<span>-&gt;</span>fragmented() <span>||</span> 
        (header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.index <span>==</span> header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>-</span> <span>1</span>);

    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>respond)
        <span>return</span>;

    <span>// SEND BACK HEADER</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));

    <span>switch</span> (header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence)
    {
    <span>case</span> <span>0x01</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,
            {
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>case</span> <span>0x02</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence, 
            {    
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>default:</span>
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Which uses the following helper function for responses:</p><pre><code><span>void</span> battleye<span>::</span>d…</code></pre></div></div>

It has allowed the world to examine what happens in a pandemic when a government allows life to carry on largely unhindered.</p><p>This is what has happened: Not only have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/15/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-deaths.html" title="">thousands more people died </a>than in neighboring countries that imposed lockdowns, but Swedenâ€™s economy has fared little better.</p><p>â€œThey literally gained nothing,â€� said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. â€œItâ€™s a self-inflicted wound, and they have no economic gains.â€�</p><p>The results of Swedenâ€™s experience are relevant well beyond Scandinavian shores.

But Swedenâ€™s grim result â€” more death, and nearly equal economic damage â€” suggests that the supposed choice between lives and paychecks is a false one: A failure to impose social distancing can cost lives and jobs at the same time.</p><p>Sweden put stock in the sensibility of its people as it largely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html" title="">avoided imposing government prohibitions</a>. The government allowed restaurants, gyms, shops, playgrounds and most schools to remain open. By contrast, Denmark and Norway opted for strict quarantines, banning large groups and locking down shops and restaurants.</p><p>More than three months later, the coronavirus is blamed for 5,420 deaths in Sweden, according to the <a href="https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/se" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>. That might not sound especially horrendous compared with the more than 129,000 Americans who have died. But Sweden is a country of only 10 million people. Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more deaths than the United States, 12 times more than Norway, seven times more than Finland and six times more than Denmark.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more coronavirus-related deaths than the United States." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The elevated death toll resulting from Swedenâ€™s approach has been clear for many weeks. What is only now emerging is how Sweden, despite letting its economy run unimpeded, has still suffered business-destroying, prosperity-diminishing damage, and at nearly the same magnitude of its neighbors.</p></div><div><div><p>Swedenâ€™s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-cenbank-forecast/table-swedish-cbank-forecasts-key-rate-at-0-for-coming-years-idUSS3N2AC001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects its economy to contract by 4.5 percent this year, a revision from a previously expected gain of 1.3 percent. The unemployment rate jumped to 9 percent in May from 7.1 percent in March. â€œThe overall damage to the economy means the recovery will be protracted, with unemployment remaining elevated,â€� Oxford Economics concluded in a recent research note.</p><p>This is more or less how damage caused by the pandemic has played out in Denmark, where the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-denmark-economy/denmarks-central-bank-sees-economy-shrink-by-41-this-year-idUSFWN2DT0WQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects that the economy will shrink 4.1 percent this year, and where joblessness has edged up to 5.6 percent in May from 4.1 percent in March.</p><p>In short, Sweden suffered a vastly higher death rate while failing to collect on the expected economic gains.</p><p>The coronavirus does not stop at national borders. Despite the governmentâ€™s decision to allow the domestic economy to roll on, Swedish businesses are stuck with the same conditions that produced recession everywhere else. And Swedish people responded to the fear of the virus by limiting their shopping â€” not enough to prevent elevated deaths, but enough to produce a decline in business activity.</p><p>Here is one takeaway with potentially universal import: It is simplistic to portray government actions such as quarantines as the cause of economic damage. The real culprit is the virus itself. From Asia to Europe to the Americas, the risks of the pandemic have disrupted businesses while prompting people to avoid shopping malls and restaurants, regardless of official policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div></div></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp"></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Sweden is exposed to the vagaries of global trade.

Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798">have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>

<p>It all began with a scratchy throat on Friday, March 13. A colleague had brought the novel coronavirus back with him from the Austrian ski resort <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-ischgl-outbreak-families-of-covid-19-victims-seek-justice-a-bbf9aa92-dfed-42d0-870c-ff9d17125d45" data-link-flag="english">Ischgl</a>. Shortly thereafter, Alexander Riesch, 26, whose name has been changed for this story, also tested positive for the virus.</p>


<div>
<p>"At first I thought, well, at least now you'll have gotten it over with," Riesch says. His doctors also had no doubt: The body of a young, healthy person wouldn't take long to vanquish the virus. They sent Riesch home to recover. But a few days later, he felt so miserable that he had to call an emergency doctor. He spent a week in the hospital.</p><p>Officially, Riesch has been recovered for nearly three months. He has antibodies against the virus in his blood. Yet he still goes through spells in which he feels very sick. So far, none of his doctors have been able to explain why.</p>

The symptoms didn't begin until after the doctors released him from the hospital and he returned home. A respiratory physician prescribed him an asthma inhaler and advised him to be patient. The cortisone does help a little, Riesch says, but his cough and the tightness in his chest return as soon as he stops taking it.</p>

<div>
<p>There's also the sudden muscle pain. Sometimes the left half of Riesch's body becomes numb, other times he feels so weak that he has to lay down immediately. And that's not even to mention the abdominal pain and nausea, skin rash and severe fatigue.</p><p>Riesch was on sick leave for 10 weeks. Meanwhile, he's back at work as a real estate agent. But every now and then, he has to cancel appointments because he simply feels too exhausted. Most of the time, he tries to live a normal life. "I've come to accept the pain I'm in now."</p><h3>A Very Strange Disease</h3><p>Half a year since the pandemic began, doctors are now observing an increasing number of coronavirus patients like Riesch who are officially recovered but in reality are far from healthy.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>"COVID-19 is very unpredictable," says Timothy Spector of King's College London, who is tracking the course of the disease in more than 200,000 COVID-19 patients over a longer period of time, with the help of a mobile app, as part of a major research project. "I am trained as a rheumatologist, so I am used to strange diseases. But COVID-19 is the strangest disease I know."</p><p>Roughly one in 10 people with the disease continue to suffer from unexplainable symptoms for more than a month, many for more than two months. The most common are exhaustion, headaches, a loss of smell, trouble breathing, dizziness, diarrhea and skin rashes. "And some of our participants still have a fever after three months," Spector says.</p>

<p>Severe damage to the lungs, heart and nervous system in some people is also of concern. The disease can cause cardiac arrhythmia or even trigger diabetes mellitus. Some patients suffer from severe concentration and memory disorders, much like dementia. Even young people can be affected. More than 1,000 children around the world have contracted multisystem inflammatory syndrome in connection with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can lead to myocarditis and circulatory failure.</p><h3>Nothing To Be Done</h3><p>"Many patients say: 'Before the coronavirus infection, I was a different person,'" says the Swiss heart surgeon Paul Vogt. Doctors now fear that the pandemic will leave behind an army of chronically ill people. Some hospitals in Germany are already beginning to set up outpatient clinics for the follow-up care of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>"People tend to think: Either you are dead, or you are healthy again," says the British physician Helen Salisbury. "But it does not work like this."</p><p>For weeks, all people talked about was intensive care units and artificial ventilation. "But now there are all these people, that will maybe be ill for a long time."</p><p>Salisbury treats several people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still suffer from exhaustion and bouts of fever or coughing and who quickly get out of breath. "All the tests are normal," she says. "There is no therapy I can offer to them." Many of the chronically sick are young -- and desperate. "But I can do nothing but listen to them," Salisbury says.</p><p>It's still a mystery to experts as to why the symptoms are so persistent and severe even after the patients have supposedly recovered from the disease. Doctors suspect it could be due to malfunctions in the immune system caused by an infection. It's also possible that once the virus succeeds in establishing itself somewhere in the body, it can strike repeatedly.</p><p>Or the lasting ailments could be a consequence of a lack of oxygen during the acute phase of the disease. Young COVID-19 patients in particular often don't notice for a long time just how badly their body is doing.</p><h3>Like Other Viruses</h3><p>Doctors see a parallel to another coronavirus disease. After the SARS pandemic in 2003, doctors continued to notice many chronically sick people, for instance in Toronto, Canada, where the worst outbreak outside of Asia took place. "When I heard of the SARS-CoV-2 long-term patients, I thought: Oh, I was waiting for this," says Harvey Moldofsky, a sleep and pain researcher and a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>A physician, Moldofsky has been a specialist in unusual diseases since early on in his career. That's why he was asked to step in and help after the 2003 SARS pandemic had subsided. "There was a group of 50 people that had all survived SARS, but although they had gone through rehab, they could not go back to work full time," Moldofsky says.</p><p>He interviewed 22 of those people in detail, and the stories he heard all sounded similar. "Over one year post-infection, they were still fatigued, weak, had muscle pain, sleeping problems and could not think straight," says Moldofsky.</p><p>All of these grievances are familiar to experts. Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome also complain of muscle, head and neck pain. Many also speak of a "brain fog" that prevents them from being able to concentrate.</p><p>A number of viruses are believed to cause chronic fatigue syndrome. Among them are the influenza and Epstein-Barr viruses, the latter of which is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, or mono. Researchers now suspect that the strange affliction is, in fact, an autoimmune reaction triggered by the viral infection, which can affect the autonomic nervous system. Other symptoms can include heart palpitations, an increased susceptibility to infection and sleep disorder.</p><h3>Neurological Problems</h3><p>Carmen Scheibenbogen, the head of the outpatient clinic for adult immunodeficiencies at Berlin's Charité University Hospital, is one of the few German experts on chronic fatigue syndrome. Many people with COVID-19 are currently turning to the physician for answers about their odd symptoms.</p><p>But even she has to disappoint them for the time being. A reliable diagnosis can only be made six months after infection. "By then, there's a good chance that everything will calm down on its own," Scheibenbogen says. Only symptoms that last longer than six months are considered chronic. And even then, there are few options for treatment.</p><p>Scheibenbogen advises those affected to take good care of their bodies. "Overexerting oneself or doing sports that exacerbate symptoms should definitely be avoided. This can make things worse," she says.</p><p>In addition to chronic fatigue, COVID-19 patients can also suffer from a number of other neurological complications. "The neuroscience research community is slowly waking up to this," says Benedict Michael, a senior clinician scientist and neurologist at the Health Protection Research Unit and the University of Liverpool. He adds that 20 to 30 percent of patients who require hospitalization develop some neurological complication.</p><p>In late June, Michael and some colleagues published a study on the matter in the medical journal <em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em>. In it, they examined 125 patients who developed neurological problems as a result of COVID-19. Around 60 percent of participants, mainly older people, suffered a stroke after being infected. Close to a third of them showed signs of other cognitive or psychiatric changes, including many younger patients.</p><p>In all, 8 percent of the 125 people examined developed a psychosis in connection with their coronavirus infection. Just under 5 percent developed dementia. "Many young people are still living their lives in the pandemic and do not even think about the fact that there is a potential risk of developing problems for them too," warns Michael.</p><p>At least in some cases it's easy to explain what caused the brain damage. Strokes can occur because COVID-19 often causes blood to clot. It's also known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can sometimes lead to encephalitis.</p><p>In many other cases, however, the cause of the complications is still unclear. "It is quite possible that this is an immune reaction," Michael says. For some, it could also be a result of stress or a lack of oxygen -- or everything altogether.</p><h3>Not the Only One</h3><p>For many patients, there's still hope that the neurological and psychiatric problems, as well as the other persistent complications like exhaustion, will diminish or eventually disappear.</p><p>The case of the general practitioner Stephanie de Giorgio from Kent in the UK is also cause for hope. The 44-year-old was likely infected by one of her patients. A mother of two, de Giorgio had no risk factors other than mild asthma and being a bit overweight could have been cause for concern. "Well, now it has got me, too," she thought. Fifteen days later, her fever subsided.</p>

We don't have a lot data or code locked away in legacy systems, and we don't have the inertia of established workflows.</p><p>One of our experiments in "how to work" has been surprisingly successful, and that is using <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter notebooks</a> in the wet lab.</p><p>We initially resisted the idea, even though we were already big fans of Jupyter. Instead, we tried to make purpose-built wet lab tools work for us, but we kept feeling like the problems they were solving were less important than the problems they <em>weren't</em> solving.</p><p>What finally pushed us over the edge was our experience developing a protocol to produce a protein from a new construct. In those kinds of situations, you usually have a basic framework for a protocol, but you need to work out the specifics in the lab — which depend on whatever is "new" about what you're doing.</p><p>We think of those specifics, which include things like time, temperature, and concentration as well as more complicated biological variables, as parameters of an abstract protocol. However, our tools didn't allow us to express the problem this way, and every time we adjusted a "parameter" or some assumption of our protocol, we needed to manually rederive the protocol steps.</p><p>Translating this protocol into a Jupyter notebook allowed us express the protocol design and steps as functions of parameters, which more closely matched our conceptual model. This immediately solved our practical pain points, and it also made scaling up production trivial, since the protocol was paramterized over all inputs.</p><p>We've put together a notebook to illustrate some of the concepts behind our Jupyter workflows. You can play around with a live version using <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/ivynatal%2Fpublic-notebooks/master">Binder</a> or just view it using <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks/-/raw/master/jupyter-workflows-wet-lab.ipynb">nbviewer</a> . The source is in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>We've since transitioned all of our lab protocols and notebooks (and some of our analyses) to Jupyter notebooks, and we've discovered that our Jupyter-based workflows increase documentaiton, reduce data duplication, and ease analysis.</p><p>So far, we haven't had any trouble working with partners or collaborators, because a PDF of a well annotated notebook is as good or better than many alternatives.</p><p>We hope over time to share more details of our workflows because we think they could be useful to other labs. Of course, this approach won't be for everyone; it's technology that our team was already comfortable with, and our switching costs were low.</p><p>We'd love to hear what you think — please <a href="https://www.ivynatal.com/contact" target="_blank">drop us a line</a>!</p><p>—Jeff and Colin</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Everyone has the same amount of time in a day, except for the day they are born and the day that they die. Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours. </p>



<p>Most of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. “I know I should work out but I don’t have time … I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time … I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.” These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves. </p>



<p>Most of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.</p>



<p>Most of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.</p>



<p>The fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not. </p>



<p>To understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4">an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas</a> where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day. </p>



<p>Next time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>When running your business, you engage with the services of many different suppliers. This can range from your power company to your web hosting service. In all of these arrangements, your business is buying a specific service at an agreed upon price.</p><p>For example, when you pay a web hosting provider, they are managing your server, your website content management system <em>(like WordPress)</em>, backups, availability, and security. This simplifies all of that for your business and the monthly fee you pay them is a fair exchange of value for the services they provide.</p><p>Now let's look at YouTube. Everyone knows the power of embedding marketing videos on their website. YouTube greatly simplifies this, allowing you to easily add videos to help build your business. In return for this life-bettering service, you pay YouTube… <strong>nothing (?)</strong>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><mark>Sounds like a great deal, except when you think about it, would <em>your</em> business provide its service for free?</mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most businesses are built to, ultimately, exchange risk and hard work <em>(what it takes to build a business)</em> for financial return. While it might be nice to give away services for free, most business owners can’t afford to do so and keep the doors open due to all the costs associated with keeping those doors open.</p><p>So when YouTube offers their service to you for free, it doesn't mean they aren't looking to do the same things with their business as you are doing with yours. It just means that <strong>you aren't the customer</strong>.</p><p>So who <em>is</em> the customer? <em>Someone </em>must be paying YouTube for the service that they provide. We know it's not you the business owner embedding videos using their player on your website. Who is paying their bills?</p><p>Here's the answer: <strong>YouTube's customers are the advertisers</strong> who pay for access to the large audience and detailed targeting data that YouTube provides them. This is similar to the way advertisers pay for the ability to show commercials on television networks, or banners on media websites. These advertisers are the <em>real </em>customers, therefore, YouTube's business model is optimized to solve for the problems and needs of these paying customers.</p><p>So what does this mean for you, the web guy or small business owner that embeds videos using YouTube on your website? It means that YouTube is offering that free service to you in order to serve their actual customer the advertisers. Let's go through a couple of the ways that YouTube ends up benefiting from your video embed that you may not have thought about.</p><h3 id="showing-ads-">Showing Ads 👀</h3><p>The simplest, most direct way is that each video embed is a source of your customer/leads’ eyeballs that YouTube can now show ads to. This is in the form of inserting video commercials into your content, banner overlays on top of the video, and suggesting other videos after the user watches your video. </p><p>These are all fairly obvious and they <em>do </em>offer switches to turn some of this off during the embed process. However, the difficulty lies in keeping up with this as <strong>YouTube continually adds new ways to monetize these free video views on your website</strong>. So while you may believe you have ads on your videos turned off <em>today</em>, when YouTube introduces a new banner format, icon, or related videos format <em>tomorrow</em>, you’ll need to figure out how to turn them off all over again. You must continually stay on top of these changes and keep adjusting your embeds, otherwise, what you thought would be a clean video promoting your business ends up showcasing ads for other products. Or worse... ads for <strong>your competitors</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At Swarmify, our mission is to bring an accelerated, distraction-free video experience to websites of all sizes. Whether you’re a  <a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/"><strong>website owner</strong></a>, <a href="https://swarmify.com/agencies/"><strong>an agency</strong></a>, or you just want to get in on <a href="https://swarmify.com/affiliate-program/"><strong>our affiliate program</strong></a>, we have a plan for you!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="user-siphoning">User Siphoning</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is a much more subtle cost but one that can have an incredible impact on your business. If you have ever watched a video on YouTube, you’ve most definitely seen related videos appear at the end of the video you watched. These related videos are personalized to each user’s behavior and fine-tuned with the strength of a million Google AI servers to pull them into watching more content. <mark>To be blunt, this is weaponized AI</mark> being used to maximize YouTube's chances of convincing a user on your website who watched your video, to watch additional videos chosen by YouTube. And with each of these videos watched, YouTube is able to serve more ads and make more revenue. That's the payoff on their end. Get your customers/leads to watch more YouTube videos and show them more ads.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2019/05/xtraffic_funnel-1.png.pagespeed.ic.x-xBpQW1fh.png" alt="YouTube costs you customers"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In addition to related videos, there's the not-so-subtle YouTube logo shown overtop your video. This means you are contributing to the company’s branding with every single watch of content on your website. By the time a user finishes watching one of your videos, it can be hard to tell who gets more benefit; your business or YouTube with all of the branding they throw on top.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="secret-weapon-detailed-targeting-">Secret Weapon: Detailed Targeting 🎯</h3><p>As discussed above, part of what YouTube is selling are the eyeballs to watch advertiser videos. But what becomes just as important for advertisers is the ability to target ideal potential customers. <strong>Showing ads for dog food to people without pets would be a huge waste of money</strong>. So YouTube needs to be able to deliver as much detail as possible on the motivations, demographics, and current needs each user has in order to better target ads for their advertisers.</p><p>The latest in AI-powered targeting is called <em>"in-market targeting"</em>. It uses AI to attempt to determine which users are likely to be ready to purchase some category of goods or services. This makes sense as we are all in-market for various goods or services at a given time. We might be tired of fixing our old car and so we are ready to start looking for a new one, but it might also be lunchtime and we are hungry and trying to figure out what food to get delivered. We are constantly <em>"in-market"</em> for purchases both large and small. Allowing an advertiser to show us their ad for a healthy and convenient chicken sandwich when we are ready to head out for lunch can be <em>devastatingly effective</em> at driving our behavior. Whereas showing us that same ad late in the evening when we are about ready to go to sleep would be almost useless.</p><p>Great. So <em>"in-market targeting"</em> is the greatest thing since sliced bread for YouTube's advertisers. How does this matter to your website where you simply embed a video showing off your beautiful dental office and smiling, friendly staff? Maybe it’s hit you how this ties together. <strong>YouTube is tracking the audience that views your website and feeding that into AI servers</strong> to determine what each user is in-market for. What that means, using the example of the dentist, is YouTube now knows these users are in the market for dental services. It learned that because they came to your dental website and watched your office promo video.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now the value for advertisers kicks in. Those users will start seeing ads for other dental offices nearby as you have just clued YouTube (Google) into very valuable potential leads for your competitors. Every dentist using Google or YouTube ads can now start showing banner and video ads around the web talking about why they should choose their office over yours. <mark>By embedding a simple video on your website, you have just given all of your competitors access to your hard-earned leads</mark> who were highly likely to buy from you since they were already on your website. But now, they start researching or second guessing as they suddenly see ads for other options at every turn. All of us have been the victim of viewing a certain product and then, suddenly, every ad across the Internet seems consumed with selling variations or alternatives to that product. Now you know how it works. Its all enabled by an unassuming, <em>“free”</em> video player.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="other-options">Other Options</h3><p>At least now you know the <em>actual </em>cost of that video player. Part of the reason YouTube seems like such a great bargain for you is because of the imbalance in understanding the amount of value they get every time a business like yours uses their player. If you are fine trading off some of your leads and customers in return for the free price, then YouTube may work for you.</p><p>On the other hand, if the cost of leads and customers being siphoned away seems too high, then there are other options. Just like your web hosting and other services, there are providers that will give you simple tools to embed videos just as easily as YouTube. You pay a small monthly fee in exchange for a video player that is focused on delivering your video to your customers and keeping those high value leads on your website where they belong. Matching your site’s look, feel, and color scheme, with no obnoxious logos or branding to distract from your message.</p><p>We provide unlimited video hosting at <a href="https://swarmify.com/">Swarmify</a>, but there are many other providers depending on your needs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/#pricing-table"><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2020/06/xbottom-cta.png.pagespeed.ic.l6DzEnm0ti.png" alt="Try SmartVideo today!"></a></p>

July 7, 2020 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/macos-windows-what-kernels-tell-you-about-security-events-part-1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/macos-windows-what-kernels-tell-you-about-security-events-part-1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>How would you compare the Windows and macOS operating systems? In what ways are they similar? Why do they each take different approaches to solving the same problem? For the last 19&nbsp;years I've developed security software for Windows. Recently, I’ve started implementing similar features on macOS. Since then, people have asked me questions like this. The more experience I gained on these two operating systems, the more I realized they’re very different. Even when the problems they set out to solve are common, their paths differ. In this two-part series, I will focus on the operating system events supported by Windows and macOS, and explain each operating system's approach.
</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>In Part 1, we’ll discuss process events.&nbsp;In Part 2, we’ll discuss file and network events. These events&nbsp;are crucial for endpoint security analysis. Through multiple perspectives in this post, I hope to:
</p><ul><li>Help you better understand the general differences between macOS and Windows on the system level
	</li><li>Help those who want to expand their experiences onto another platform be better prepared and adapted to differences that might seem to be shocking from their past experiences
	</li><li>Help cybersecurity professionals enrich their toolsets for creating innovative security products</li></ul><p>This post is based on some of my own experiences.&nbsp;It does not intend to be an exhaustive list.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Open vs. closed</h3></strong></p><p>Microsoft Windows has traditionally been open. It runs on hardware from different vendors and allows third-party developers to write applications on top of it. macOS is part of Apple’s end-to-end integrated ecosystem, which is quite the opposite of being “open.” This article does not try to take sides on the decades-long “open vs. closed” debate. Apart from end-to-end user experience, developers and researchers usually care about other things.&nbsp;
</p><p>The abundance of APIs and documents provided by Windows really enabled developers to do virtually anything in the cyber world. While on the macOS side, the beauty of simplicity reminds people that Apple takes lots of things as their own responsibility instead of sharing them with third-party developers. If you find something from Apple difficult to use, it’s perhaps because you’re looking at something&nbsp;Apple feels is their own backyard.&nbsp;Take&nbsp;<a href="https://knight.sc/debugging/2018/08/15/macos-kernel-debugging.html">kernel mode debugging</a> or <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2118.html">kernel core dumps</a>&nbsp;as examples. On the upside though, macOS developers can indulge themselves in the open source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu">Darwin kernel</a>, whereas Windows’ kernel is closed source&nbsp;and yet Windows developers feel spoiled with an abundance of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">documentation</a>.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Microkernel vs. monolithic kernel</h3></strong></p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0a39b4008faf9cb9/5eea6e7d18cea32a006fba82/macos-windows-kernels-blog-monolothic-kernel-vs-microkernel.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt0a39b4008faf9cb9" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">Structure of monolithic and microkernel-based operating systems</a></figcaption><p>Modern macOS and Microsoft Windows both have hybrid kernels, which are neither a pure microkernel, nor monolithic. However, one cannot infer that the two kernels are similarly architectured based on the same kernel type — they actually came from different places.
</p><p>Microsoft Windows, in the Windows 9x days, used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel">monolithic</a> kernel. macOS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU</a> consists of several core building blocks, one of which came from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach kernel</a> that carries the genes of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">microkernel</a>. Even though both operating systems have evolved into today’s “hybrid” form, their early influences still manifest and affect developers’ daily lives. For example, Apple announced in WWDC 2019 it’s going to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">deprecate kernel extensions (kext) support</a> for third-party developers starting with macOS 10.16. This means they are kicking third-party developers out of the kernel. For some, this may seem shocking. However, thinking from a microkernel point of view, this change sounds just like a logical next step.
</p><p>Over the years, Microsoft created a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/">Windows Driver Framework</a>. It also moved lots of traditional kernel mode driver support into user mode, encouraging people to implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">drivers in user mode</a>. However, caveats exist. For example, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page">Windows Filtering Platform</a>, even though most of the functionalities can be done in user mode, some of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23533627/is-it-possible-to-implement-user-mode-callouts-in-wfp-windows-filtering-platfor">crucial functionalities</a> still have to be done in the kernel.&nbsp;
</p> <p><strong><h3>Backward compatibility vs. complete rewrite</h3></strong></p><p>Some people have doubts about Apple's WWDC 2019 kext deprecation announcement, as it means that backward compatibility is broken for any third-party software that includes kexts. People will have to rewrite things in user mode from scratch. It’s understandable that some may want Apple to delay or cancel the deprecation. Regardless, deprecation is&nbsp;happening as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g28d5j9l">planned</a>. Because it is a closed ecosystem and Apple retains end-to-end control, backward compatibility is never on its menu and deprecation has been a consistent part of macOS releases. Check out the “Deprecation” sections in a few of the past release notes: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_mojave_10_14_release_notes?language=objc">Mojave</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes?language=objc">Catalina</a>, and the coming release of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-beta-release-notes">Big Sur</a>.
</p><p>This means, as a macOS developer, you may frequently find yourself rewriting everything from scratch — even if your software is well-architected and implemented. Windows, on the other hand, has been keeping its promise of backward compatibility. You may find applications created for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.1</a> still run on the latest Windows 10. Microsoft does occasionally attempt to deprecate things. For example, it has been trying to deprecate support for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/about-file-system-legacy-filter-drivers">legacy file system drivers</a> ever since the introduction of its replacement —&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/filter-manager-concepts">file system minifilter</a> — in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP SP2</a> on August 25, 2004. But, as of today, it’s still unable to do so. However, this doesn’t mean legacy file system drivers remain a viable choice for third-party developers.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Process events</h2></strong></p><p>Windows and macOS organize process events very differently. Windows provides a single kernel callback, set by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutine">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">Ex</a>, to trace all process creations and terminations. macOS process events are mainly retrieved from two sources:
</p><ul><li>An executable file’s <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnode.9">vnode</a> operations
	</li><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/vfork.2.html"><em>fork()</em></a> system call activities</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Windows</h3></strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</a> allows developers to register a callback with Windows. Later on when a process is created or exits, Windows will notify the caller by invoking the callback. The callback can be used for both prevention and notification. The parameters passed to the callback contain a rich set of information useful for process events, shown in the following figure:
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt45abfe2a9f2dc473/5eea6ea834f8f30c7cfb289a/macos-windows-kernels-blog-process-events.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt45abfe2a9f2dc473" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 2: Screenshot of a debug session that shows PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx parameters
</figcaption><p>To learn how to use <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong>, take a look at Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/general/obcallback">ObCallback&nbsp; Registration Driver</a> sample code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/context.html">context of a process</a>. On Windows, when the callback registered by <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong> is invoked, it’s in the context of the creating process for process creations. For process terminations, it’s in the context of the terminating process (see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">document</a>). Inside the Windows kernel, most of the time you can find out the actor process by simply calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-psgetcurrentprocessid">PsGetCurrentProcessId</a>, because the kernel service usually shares context with the actor process. However, in the macOS kernel (for <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECLISTENERGOTCHAS">reasons</a>), developers are advised to avoid calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1488975-proc_self?language=objc">proc_self</a> in the kernel to find out the actor process. This is easier to understand from a microkernel’s point of view, because most of the system services are delegated to other processes on a microkernel system. Particularly, when <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html">kernel extensions</a> are replaced by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/system-extensions/">system extensions</a> (which runs in user mode) in macOS 10.16, the same advice should be strictly followed.
</p> <p><strong><h3>macOS</h3></strong> <strong><h4>Kauth/MACF</h4></strong></p><p><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html">Kauth</a> is a Kernel Programming Interface (KPI) provided by macOS to allow third parties — primarily security software developers — to intercept select operations.<sup>1</sup> As the definition suggests, it can only be used in kernel mode. There’s another KPI, called <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mac.html">Mandatory Access Control Framework</a> (MACF), which is way more powerful than Kauth, but it’s Apple’s private KPI and not “open” for third-party developers. With the kext deprecation announcement, both Kauth and MACF won’t be available for third-party developers, starting with macOS 10.16. I briefly describe Kauth here to present a continuity view for you to get an idea of macOS's evolution:
</p><p>Kauth defines “scopes,”&nbsp;which Apple describes as “areas of interest” for authorization within the kernel.<sup>1</sup> A couple scopes in Kauth provide means for third-party software to get notified when a process is launched.
</p><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECVNODESCOPE">Vnode scope</a>&nbsp;- Vnode scope is capable of preventing a process from being launched. By calling KPI <em>kauth_listen_scope(KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE,...)</em>, a developer can register a vnode scope listener callback. When an operation on a vnode is about to happen, macOS will invoke the callback. The callback can then block or allow the operation. Vnode operations are not limited to executions. There are other types of vnode operations as well, such as open/close/read/write/etc. By checking <em>KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE</em> flag against the vnode operation (<em>action</em>), we know a file is executed — which roughly translates to “a process is launched” in Windows language.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECFILEOPSCOPE">File operation scope</a>&nbsp;- Similar to vnode, file operation scope is able to report operations on a file. The <em>KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC</em> flag in the <em>action</em> parameter indicates that a file is being executed. However, file operation scope works only in listening mode. It can not be used to prevent a file from being executed inline.</li></ul> <p><strong><h4>Endpoint Security system extensions</h4></strong></p><p>macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security</a> (ES) is a kind of System Extension which runs in user mode, and it’s the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">replacement</a> for Kauth. In the new ES framework, event types are better organized in one enum definition 
	<strong><em><a href="#es_event_type_t">es_event_type_t</a></em></strong> defined in XCode’s SDK header file:
</p><p>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/EndpointSecurity/ESTypes.h
</p><p>You can see that process events are just a subset of ES events (more discussion about ES events can be found in the next File Events section). The few types of ES events pertaining to process events are:&nbsp;
</p><ul> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_FORK</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXIT</em></li></em></ul><p>Note that if you find “<strong><em>AUTH</em></strong>” in the event …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

		<h3>How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list</h3>
<p><em>(TLDR: We wrote an annotated reading list to get you started in learning Bayesian statistics. <span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1317-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Published version</a></span>. <span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301981861_How_to_become_a_Bayesian_in_eight_easy_steps_An_annotated_reading_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Researchgate</a>. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PsyArxiv</a></span>.)</em></p>
<p>It can be hard to know where to start when you want to learn about&nbsp;Bayesian statistics.&nbsp;I am frequently asked&nbsp;to share&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;introductory resources to Bayesian statistics, and my go-to answer has been to share a dropbox folder with a bunch of PDFs that aren’t really sorted or cohesive. In some sense&nbsp;I was acting as&nbsp;little&nbsp;more than a glorified Google Scholar search bar.</p>
<p>It seems like there is&nbsp;some&nbsp;tension out there with regard to Bayes, in that many people want to know more about it, but when they pick up, say, Andrew Gelman and colleagues’&nbsp;<em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> they get totally overwhelmed. And then they just think, “Screw this esoteric B.S.” and give up because it doesn’t seem like it is worth their time or effort.</p>
<p>I think this&nbsp;happens a lot. Introductory Bayesian texts usually assume a level of training in mathematical statistics that most researchers simply don’t have time (or otherwise don’t need) to learn. There are actually&nbsp;a lot of accessible Bayesian resources&nbsp;out there that don’t require much math stat background at all, but it just so happens&nbsp;that they are not consolidated anywhere so people don’t necessarily know about them.</p>
<h3>Enter the eight step program</h3>
<p>Beth Baribault, Peter Edelsbrunner (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/peter1328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@peter1328</a></span>), Fabian Dablander (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/fdabl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fdabl</a></span>), Quentin Gronau, and I have just finished <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a&nbsp;new paper</a></span> that tries to&nbsp;remedy this situation, titled, “How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list.” We were invited to submit this paper for a special issue on Bayesian statistics for&nbsp;<em>Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</em>.&nbsp;Each paper in the special issue addresses a specific question we often hear about Bayesian statistics, and ours was the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a reviewer/editor handling a manuscript that uses Bayesian methods; which articles should I read to get a quick idea of what that means?</p></blockquote>
<p>So <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>‘s goal is not so much to teach readers how to actually&nbsp;<em>perform</em> Bayesian data analysis — there are other papers in the special issue for that — but to facilitate readers in their quest to understand basic Bayesian concepts. We think it will&nbsp;serve as a nice introductory reading list for any interested researcher.</p>
<p>The format of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> is straightforward. We highlight&nbsp;eight papers that had a big impact on our own understanding of Bayesian statistics, as well as short descriptions of an additional 28 resources in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading </em>appendix. The first four papers&nbsp;are focused on theoretical introductions, and the second four&nbsp;have a&nbsp;slightly more applied focus.</p>
<p>We also give every resource&nbsp;a ranking from 1–9 on two dimensions: Focus (theoretical vs. applied) and Difficulty (easy vs. hard). We tried to provide a wide range of resources, from easy&nbsp;applications (#14: Wagenmakers, Lee, and Morey’s “Bayesian benefits for the pragmatic researcher”) to challenging&nbsp;theoretical discussions (#12: Edwards, Lindman and Savage’s “Bayesian statistical inference for psychological research”) and others&nbsp;in between.</p>
<p>The figure below (Figure A1, available on the last page of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>) summarizes our rankings:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2338" data-permalink="https://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/07/understanding-bayes-how-to-become-a-bayesian-in-eight-easy-steps/readinglist/#main" data-orig-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png" data-orig-size="1100,1000" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Readinglist" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700" src="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700" alt="Readinglist.png" srcset="https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=700 700w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=150 150w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=300 300w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=768 768w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png?w=1024 1024w, https://nicebrain.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/readinglist.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>The emboldened numbers (1–8) are the papers that we’ve commented on&nbsp;in detail, numbers in light text (9–30) are papers we briefly describe in the appendix, and the italicized numbers (31–36) are our recommended introductory books (also listed in the appendix).</p>
<p>This is how we chose to frame&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, the guide is designed such that a researcher might be able to read all eight of the highlighted articles and some supplemental readings within a few days. After readers acquaint themselves with these sources, they should be well-equipped both to interpret existing research and to evaluate new research that relies on Bayesian methods.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The list</h3>
<p>Here’s the list of papers we chose to cover&nbsp;in detail:</p>

<li>Lee (2008):&nbsp;Three case studies in the Bayesian analysis of cognitive models. <span><a href="http://tinyurl.com/lee2008cognitive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll have to check out&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> to see our commentary&nbsp;and to find out what other articles we&nbsp;included in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading</em> appendix. We provide urls (web archived when possible;&nbsp;<span><a href="http://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive.org/web/</a></span>) to PDFs of the eight main papers (except #2, that’s on the DBDA website), and wherever possible for the rest of the resources (some did not have free copies online;&nbsp;see&nbsp;the <em>References</em>).</p>
<p>I thought this was a fun&nbsp;paper&nbsp;to write, and if you think you might want to learn some Bayesian basics I hope you will consider reading it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should mention that we wrote the whole paper collaboratively on <span><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=19f671ddd62a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overleaf.com</a></span>. It is a great site that makes it easy to&nbsp;get started using&nbsp;LaTeX, and I highly recommend trying it out.</p>
<p>This is the fifth post in the&nbsp;<span><em><a href="https://alexanderetz.com/understanding-bayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding Bayes</a></em></span> series. Until next time,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago we wrote about "<a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Our Experience with Stripe Atlas</a>" and what it was like to use them to start a small internet business (tldr; generally good).</p>
<p>One of the perks of Stripe Atlas is that they offer a heap of credits for multiple cloud platforms. From the Stripe site:</p>
<p>"Stripe Atlas founders can access free credits, exclusive access to free products, and discounted pricing from our partners, including $5,000 in credits from Amazon Web Services and $10,000 in credits from DigitalOcean."</p>
<p>There's always an understanding with services like this that credit offers come with a lot of hand-waving and "caveat emptor"-ing: notice founders "<em>have access to</em>" free credits (emphasis ours), which could imply that some founders have the capacity to call on those funds, but not all. But still, the language does seem very direct and makes it easy to believe signing up includes $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We have not received $5,000 in AWS credits. But now the good news: We <em>have</em> still received <strong>$1,000 in AWS credits</strong>.</p>
<p>$1,000 is still very generous, and a great gift from Stripe. No business filing with Stripe Atlas should ever depend on $1,000 of AWS credits as some kind of life-or-death runway, and for everyone receiving it it's more a small bonus than some kind of critical seed money.</p>
<p>But I do think it's useful to note, if you're an entrepreneur considering Stripe Atlas, what general figures you can expect. We're not a high capital-intensive operation of course, so if you're in a similar micro-saas space, then you also probably won't get the full 5k.</p>
<p>We're not sure what path you should take <em>to get</em> that possible $5,000 in AWS credits. There's not much communication about what criteria Stripe uses to arrive at the number they finalize on.</p>
<p>But you heard it from us: Take that 5,000 number with a grain of salt. It's a great gift - just maybe not as great as you think.</p>

The limited control over the files content makes exploitation very hard; perhaps crafting an executable PowerShell script or bat file is plausible, but then there is the problem of getting those executed.</p><p>Instead, I chose to combine my active trace recording with a call to:</p><pre><code>WINRT_IMPL_AUTO(Windows<span>::</span>Foundation<span>::</span>IAsyncAction) SnapCustomTraceAsync(param<span>::</span>hstring <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> outputDirectory)
</code></pre><p>When supplying an <code>outputDirectory</code> value located inside <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> (Where the <code>.etl</code> files of my running trace are saved) an interesting behavior emerges.</p><p>The Diagtrack Service will rename <em>all</em> the created <code>.etl</code> files in <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> to the directory given as the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument to <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>. This allows destination control to be acquired because rename operations that occur where the source file gets created in a folder that grants non-privileged users write access are exploitable. This is due to the permission inheritance of files and their parent directories. When a file is moved by a rename operation, the DACL does not change. What this means is that if we can make the destination become <code>%WINDIR%\System32</code>, and somehow move the file then we will still have write permission to the file. So, we know we control the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument of <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>, but some limitations exist.</p><p>If the chosen <code>outputDirectory</code> is not a child of <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>, the rename will not happen. The <code>outputDirectory</code> cannot exist because the Diagtrack Service has to create it. When created, it is created with SYSTEM as its owner; only the READ permission is granted to users.</p><p>This is problematic as we cannot make the directory into a mount point. Even if we had the required permissions, we would be stopped by not being able to empty the directory because Diagtrack has placed the snapshot output etl file inside it. Lucky for us, we can circumvent these obstacles by creating two levels of indirection between the <code>outputDirectory</code> destination and <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>.</p><p>By creating the folder <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections</code> and supplying <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> as the <code>outputDirectory</code> we allow Diagtrack to create the snap folder with its limited permissions, as we are inside <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>. With this, we can rename the <code>extra</code> folder, as it is created by us. The two levels of indirection is necessary to bypass the locking of the directory due to Diagtrack having open files inside the directory. When <code>extra</code> is renamed, we can recreate <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> (which is now empty) and we have full permissions to it as we are the owner!</p><p>Now, we can turn <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> into a mount point targeted at <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code> and Diagtrack will move all files matching <code>WPR_initiated_DiagTrack*.etl*</code> into <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code>. The files will still be writeable as they were created in a folder that granted users permission to WRITE. Unfortunately, having full control over a file in System32 is not quite enough for code execution… that is, unless we have a way of executing user controllable filenames - like the DiagnosticHub plugin method popularized by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo">James Forshaw</a></strong>. There’s a caveat though, DiagnosticHub now requires any DLL it loads to be signed by Microsoft, but we do have some ways to execute a DLL file in system32 under SYSTEM security context - if the filename is something specific. Another snag though is that the filename is not controllable. So, how can we take control?</p><p>If instead of making the mountpoint target System32, we target an Object Directory in the NT namespace and create a symbolic link with the same name as the rename destination file, we gain control over the filename. The target of the symbolic link will become the rename operations destination. For instance, setting it to<code>\??\%WINDIR%\system32\phoneinfo.dll</code> results in write permission to a file the Error Reporting service will load and execute when an error report is submitted out of process. For my mountpoint target I chose <code>\RPC Control</code> as it allows all users to create symbolic links inside.</p><p>Let’s try it!</p><p>When Diagtrack should have done the rename, nothing happened. This is because, before the rename operation is done, the destination folder is opened, but now is an object directory. This means it’s unable to be opened by the file/directory API calls. This can be circumvented by timing the creation of the mount point to be after the opening of the folder, but before the rename. Normally in such situations, I create a file in the destination folder with the same name as the rename destination file. Then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In this blog post, I would like to show you a practical example of a “fake it till you make it” approach to product development. To my mind, it basically means that you are trying to stay a few steps ahead of your current situation. You are “faking” the idea that you have progressed more, but you actually haven’t. This approach gave me invaluable answers for my product which were hard to get otherwise.</p><h2 id="here-is-my-story">Here is my story:</h2><p>3 years ago, my former manager came to me and told me to do around 1500 banner ads. The company I worked for got new products and they wanted to market them in different countries. We got 6 products in 5 colors and the aim was to create ad banners for 3 countries. The goal was to create 15 formats of each banner ad. It was a nightmare for the graphic department. And I was its team leader.</p><p>When I imagined myself doing 1500 banner ads, I wanted to cry. This scenario of creating thousands of banners could happen easily every month. It is possible to do manually 1500 ad banners, but it is just… too boring! I wanted to be a creator, not a generator.</p><p>I started immediately googling how I can automate the process of creating banners sets. I found some solutions but they were pretty useless. They weren’t flexible enough.</p><p>I decided to create my own solution. I experimented with Photoshop, more specifically with the “Actions” feature there. Basically, the Actions feature was recording my steps in Photoshop. So, I could record how I manually generated banners, then play it again and&nbsp;generate the banners. It was pretty simple: Yet powerful. With this script I created, I was able to automate some parts of the process and help our department to be faster.</p><p>I was interested in a community of graphic designers who had the same problem. With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/iChangeTheWay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ivan</a>, I created a landing page in a few hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/tmvst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tomas</a> sketched the logo in 5 minutes, then we came up with pricing. I created a video of the script and…</p><p>I posted it to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</p><p>And this is what happened:</p><p><span>

<em>My post to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</em></p><p>I was amazed by how many people had the same problem as us. What was more amazing was that 5 people bought the script. It wasn’t cheap, it cost around 110€. Looking back retrospectively, I think it was… a miracle. It showed me that the problem was there and people were willing to pay for the solution.</p><p>At that time I didn’t know anything about building a product, selling, consumer behavior, or SaaS (Software as a Service). Well, I knew the theory, but just from videos, friends, or lectures. But I didn’t have any tangible experience.</p><h2 id="i-started-with-experimentation">I started with experimentation.</h2><p>I created <strong>a free version of a Photoshop ad generator as a Freemium model,</strong> which could automate only 6 banner formats in contrast to the full version which could automate 20 formats. I gave it for free to people in exchange for getting feedback from them.</p><p>To be honest…</p><p>0 people bought the full version after they tried the free version.</p><p>Frankly put, it failed. I was overly optimistic&nbsp;and thought that the product would do better. On the other hand, It motivated me to ask people what was not working for them and how I could get better. I even gave the full professional freelancers version, which cost 110€, for free in exchange for feedback.</p><p>And what happened?</p><p><strong>Nobody wrote me back.</strong></p><p>It sucked. I didn’t know what to do next.</p><p>At that time I let it go. I didn’t have money to build the product and I didn’t feel that I had enough experience to build the software from scratch.</p><h2 id="after-more-than-a-year-break">After more than a year break</h2><p>After a year and a half, I decided to explore this topic again. I learned new things from Product Management, User Experience design, I was closer to friends who were dealing with product development on a daily basis. So I gave it a try.</p><p>The last script didn’t work for all graphics of banners, it worked only for a few specific graphics. It was good, but once you wanted to generate some complicated banner, this script did not work smoothly. Meanwhile, Photoshop developed a few other features, which changed the game. My game.</p><h2 id="little-technical-context">Little technical context</h2><p>Scripts are technically the easiest to do however, they are quite limited. I decided to learn more about what was feasible in Photoshop. I’d learned about plugins, which seemed like the right way to do things. However, to do a plugin, I needed a front end developer, because I couldn’t code on a sufficient level.</p><p>The problem is that building something with a developer is the most expensive thing to do. And I didn’t even know if people were still interested in the solution. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to improve generating ad banners as much as I could, but how it should work? I had no clue.</p><h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it!</h2><p>But I had something that I believed was powerful. Designer superpower. Really, Sam? Superpower?… Yes, superpower. Let me explain.</p><p>If I want to get rid of generating, what should I do? I could&nbsp; just hit some magic button and everything would be set. But how would it work? It’s time for 🥁 designer superpower, (which I believe is a designers’ toolset).</p><p><span>

<em>Designer superpower - designers<!-- -->’<!-- --> toolset</em></p><p>I realized that I could “fake” the whole plugin and interactions in it.

<em>Preparation for video.</em></p><p>Then I needed somehow to fake the algorithm of generating banners. So I recorded screen videos and I got rid of some parts. I removed these parts where I needed to manually re-organize components in banners. In the end, these screen recordings looked like a great generating algorithm.</p><p>Now the final part. I needed to connect these parts. For this purpose I used Adobe After Effects.</p><p>And this is the final video which took me 2 weeks to do:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE</a></p><p>I showed this video to friends of mine and they thought that I had learned how to code. At that point, I knew I had done it well.</p><p><strong>🗒Side note:</strong> When you think of that, this is a superpower. With some tools, you can show people (in my case graphic designers) the future them and spark imagination. You can take some ideas and make them look real. Suddenly, all the people can see how your product should behave and what it should do. Isn’t that powerful?</p><p><span>

<em>Facebook post with video which gave me 400 signups</em></p><p>I added my <a href="https://www.bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">landing page</a> in the post, then I shared it to other groups/forums and I got 400 signups.</p><p>I even got some deal with a design agency, which told me that they would give us some money to develop a plugin. Moreover, I even had 2 meetings with them. Just based on the video.</p><p>In the end, nothing came from this deal. That was reasonable. Here is why: The truth was, that I had just released the video. I didn’t have anything else. Just some parts connected with duct tape. At that time, I had no clue how close we could get with the real code.</p><p><strong>💡Lesson learned</strong></p><p>Showing a “fake” video is powerful for sharing a vision and testing if there is a need for a solution. On the other hand, if the video is too ambitious, people will take it as a norm and will base their expectations on the video. If the real product doesn’t match the video afterward, they will probably be unsatisfied because the product is&nbsp;incomplete. This thing happened to me when I had a call with a user during beta testing. She expected that the complete product should work as it was on the video. So sometimes it is better to be realistic. Otherwise, you will create unhappy initial users. But I believe it is a trade-off and you need to count on that.</p><p>Once I saw that the product was still in demand I found a programmer called Petr and we started with the development of the plugin. The video was also a great tool for how to communicate what I wanted to achieve. Of course, video showed happy path&nbsp;and I needed to design “what if” scenarios, afterwards. But it served my expectations&nbsp;perfectly.</p><p>Then we went through beta testing, which 50 people joined. Nowadays the <a href="https://bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">product is live.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><h3 id="a-designer-toolset-is-a-superpower-you-can-easily-create-something-that-was-not-on-the-market-before-and-validate-your-idea-just-in-a-week">A Designer toolset is a superpower.

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong> This paper proposes a new type of implicit generative model that is able to quickly learn a latent representation without an explicit encoder. This is achieved with an implicit neural network that takes as inputs points in the coordinate space alongside a latent vector initialised with zeros. The gradients of the data fitting loss with respect to this zero vector are jointly optimised to act as latent points that capture the data manifold. The results show similar characteristics to autoencoders, but with fewer parameters and the advantages of implicit representation networks.</p>
        
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Gradient Origin Networks (GONs) are comparable to Variational Autoencoders in that both compress data into latent representations and permit sampling in a single step. However, GONs use gradients as encodings meaning that they have a much simpler architecture:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In Gradient Origin Networks, unknown parameters in the latent space are initialised at the origin. This zero vector is concatenated with the known coordinate parameters, which becomes the inputs of an implicit representation network <i>F</i> with a prior over the gradients (a <a href="https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/">SIREN</a> whose gradients are normally distributed). This means we can compute gradients of the data fitting loss with respect to these inputs, and jointly optimise for the new latents:
        </p>

        <p><img alt="Gradient Origin Network" src="https://cwkx.github.io/data/GON/data/gon-eqn.png"></p><p>At inference, the latent vector can be sampled in a single step without requiring iteration. Here are some random spherical interpolations showing this:</p>

        <p>In practice, we find GONs to be parameter-efficient and fast to train. For more details, please watch the YouTube video and read the paper in the links above.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> We have proposed a new type of implicit generative model that captures the dataset without requiring an explicit encoder. By initialising a latent vector of our unknown parameters with zeros, we have shown that it is possible to compute the gradients of the data fitting loss with respect to this origin, and then jointly fit the data while learning this new point of reference in the latent space. The results show this approach is able to represent datasets using a small number of parameters, with the advantage of implicit representation networks being able to model many different types of discrete signals.</p>

    <p><br>
I’ve been thinking about writing this article for a bit, but have been most prompted by a post grandly titled “<a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html">Async Python is not faster</a>”. The post was rooted with some good motivations and observations, but also fell somewhat into a polarising mode of discussion that I’d like to see our communities try to move beyond.</p>

<p>Async concurrency necessarily brings with it an element of ecosystem split, and this can mean that it’s a bit of a divisive area to try to have conversations within.</p>

<p>However I think we could probably benefit from a bit more recognition of where there is shared ground. And in areas where there’s less clarity, to be able to have constructive conversations around the relative merits in differing approaches.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="-why-you-shouldnt-care-about-performance">★ Why you shouldn’t care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>If you’re starting a new project, and choosing a python async framework vs a python sync framework, then any “performance” metrics around the frameworks <em>almost certainly don’t actually matter</em>, and are almost always a nonsense point of debate.</p>

<p>What is <em>actually</em> critical to your business is the development experience and strength of the surrounding ecosystem. What is your time to market going to be? How will the maintenance overhead be? How robust and evolvable is your codebase?</p>

<h3 id="-why-you-might-care-about-performance">★ Why you might care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Having said that, there <em>are</em> a small portion of cases where the performance characteristics are a valid consideration. Particularly if your web framework makes lots of outgoing HTTP requests or other networking and I/O.</p>

<p>It’s important for the Python ecosystem that it ought to compare favourably to other dynamic languages in domains where async is beneficial. We don’t want to be in a position where “we’re using JavaScript because we believe it’ll scale up better” is a valid market blocker vs. choosing Python.</p>

<h3 id="-what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-performance">★ What we’re talking about when we talk about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Like-for-like a single async function call in isolation will be marginally slower than a plain function call. That’s not contentious.</p>

<p>What we’re actually interested in is how <em>efficiently</em> we can interleave multiple concurrent tasks. In I/O bound systems co-operative concurrency (async) performs more efficiently under high concurrency than threaded concurrency (sync). Again, not contentious.</p>

<p>Again - Async Python is not faster. It <em>is</em> more efficient. Which will <em>tend</em> to mean that on I/O bound systems, the latency will <em>continue</em> to remain low even as the level of concurrency increases.</p>

<h3 id="-there-are-no-good-benchmarks">★ There are no good benchmarks.</h3>

<p>JSON “hello world” benchmarks are junk. Almost all cases of “I’ve created this benchmark myself” are likely to be junk. The prevalence of new frameworks overly focusing on nebulous benchmarking claims is generally junk. An obsession on benchmarking numbers can also sometimes result in poor overall design choices, such as obfuscated or unnecessarily coupled bits of codebase, because some not-very-meaningful metric is being prioritised over the code design itself. None of this should be contentious.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>always</em> true, for example, when Sanic was introduced there was a genuine step forward which was worth talking about, so I can understand why there was a focus there. But there’s still a ridiculous hype-cycle attached as a result, and we need to be really careful about trying to step beyond that.</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable if benchmarking is discussed in a sensible context and placement. For example, to the extent that Uvicorn and Starlette have discussed performance it has only ever been with a view to making a solid case that having a <em>properly specified</em> server/framework boundary API isn’t a negative performance consideration. Prior to the introduction of ASGI, Python’s async web ecosystem had generally bundled together both the low-level HTTP handling and the high level framework, and there was a notion that needed dispelling that introducing a properly specified separation of concerns wasn’t a good approach because <em>“something something performance something”</em>.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> going to look at web framework benchmarks for some very rough first-pass ideas about relative efficiency then the TechEmpower benchmarks should almost certainly be your baseline, since they’re at least independent, and have a decent range of test cases. If you’re going to diverge from them have some good argument for doing so.</p>

<p>The “Async Python is not faster” benchmarking is a reasonable example here, since it had clearly applied a decent degree of thoughtfulness. Even so there were still problems with the methodology, as <a href="https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1271719778324025349">Łukasz Langa did a good job of unpicking</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, the TechEmpower benchmarks only show throughput, and don’t include any <em>meaningful</em> latency information. There’s actually a good reason for that, since
comparing latencies is really difficult. You can’t arrive at a single “95% latency” figure, because the figure you’ll arrive at <em>also depends on what throughput load you’re putting the system under</em> at the time of measuring the latency.</p>

<p>As a result measuring latency is only ever really meaningful if you’re looking at <em>graphs of how the latencies vary over a range of different throughputs</em>. Amber Brown’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxP1I-tm_2c">DjangoCon 2019 keynote talk does a fantastic job of showing some examples here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-asgi-is-a-really-positive-step-for-the-async-ecosystem">★ ASGI is a really positive step for the async ecosystem.</h3>

<p>Having a decently specified server/framework interface is a <em>really good thing</em>. Andrew Godwin’s design for ASGI fills this gap with a WSGI-like approach. That has a set of trade-offs, but it’s a pretty pragmatic and well rounded choice.</p>

<p>This should not really be contentious.</p>

<h3 id="-its-about-functionality">★ It’s about functionality.</h3>

<p>Async isn’t just about achieving higher levels of concurrency-per-server, it also makes it a bunch of new functionality more feasible, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling long-lived network connections like Websockets.</li>
  <li>Long-lived HTTP connections and server sent events.</li>
  <li>Dealing with background tasks without necessarily needing a full blown task queue subcomponent.</li>
  <li>Parallelizing outgoing HTTP requests or other high latency I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-not-everything-is-perfect">★ Not everything is perfect.</h3>

<p>The async ecosystem is far more immature than the existing thread synchronous. There are different challenges there, such as ensuring that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">backpressure is handled consistently throughout the various async APIs</a>, or in <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">applying the lessons of structured concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the “stdlib asyncio isn’t perfect” line a good argument either against asyncio specifically, or against async/await in general.</p>

<p>It’s okay that there’s still work to do in places. We know.  Let’s get that work done.</p>

<h3 id="-async-is-harder">★ Async is harder.</h3>

<p>Having to <em>think</em> about if a function does or doesn’t make I/O or could otherwise block <em>is unarguably more complex than not having to think about it</em>. It’s also more precise - you’re having to think about that for a reason, and done properly it’s presenting you with more information as a result. Being able to reason more clearly about which parts of your framework stack do or don’t perform I/O has a cost but also brings benefits.</p>

<p>There’s an analogy to make there in that writing Python using explicitly enforced typing is likely to be a harder than writing Python in an untyped style. It’s harder because you’re <em>also being more precise</em>. That’s not necessarily either good or bad, but it is definitively <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>This also gets to the point about why the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What colour is your function</a>” argument isn’t actually a good case against async code, even if it seems to make clear sense on first pass. We’re coloring our functions because we’re <em>enforcing the exposure of some important information all the way throughout the stack</em>. That’s not an inherently bad thing to do.</p>

<hr>



<p>If those are areas where I think we ought to be able to reach consensus on, then there’s also a few areas where I think that the possible outcomes are less clear…</p>

<h3 id="-you-take-the-high-road-and-ill-take-the-low-road">★ You take the high road, and I’ll take the low road.</h3>

<p>There’s a few different tacks we might take onto introducing async into the Python web framework ecosystem…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting mostly staying with threaded web frameworks. There’s actually a perfectly decent case to make that Python <em>on the whole</em> should eschew a <em>wide move towards async</em>. That the drawbacks of moving large swathes of the ecosystem towards an async model outweigh the advantages. (Pros: Simpler for the end developer. Huge existing ecosystem.)</li>
  <li>Working towards blended approaches. This is being championed within the Django community which is incrementally adding async support, largely off the back of some Herculean work by Andrew Godwin and others. This approach can either be in the form of adding support for async at the server level, while keeping the framework level strictly thread-synchronous. Or it can gradually start to expose optional async capabilities all the way through the stack. (Pros: Brings along the existing ecosystem, while adding async capabilities when they’re needed.)</li>
  <li>Working towards async-native frameworks. (Pros: Lower overall complexity of the stack then blended approach. More efficient since there’s less overhead in marshalling between two style all the way through the stack. If we’re having to write large amounts of new code then it’s not a bad inflection point at which to also rethink and finesse other aspects of how we’re putting together new frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t really say which of these will yield the best dividends. Personally I <em>happen</em> to be working in the last of those three slices, simply because I can see a bunch of areas where I can contribute meaningfully towards the ecosystem there.</p>

<h3 id="-positioning-asyncio-and-trio">★ Positioning asyncio and Trio</h3>

<p>There another big question mark over the relative positioning of asyncio and Trio in the ecosystem. Trio is a newer approach to a Python async framework, that’s meticulously designed, and based on the principles of structured concurrency, that have been outlined by it’s author, Nathaniel Smith.</p>

<p>The difficulty this brings is that Trio is necessarily incompatible with asyncio, and introduces an ecosystem-split within an ecosystem-split.</p>

<p>There’s a few different …</p></div></div>

<article>
    <p>Have you ever thought how good it would be to have a help message for your shell script
that you wrote a month ago and already forgot what it is supposed to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is always a way to show a message using cat (meow) or a bunch of echo
calls.</p>
<p>But there is a neat trick.</p>
<p>Add your message with all the required information on top of your file, just right
after the shebang.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash

<span>###</span>
<span>### Options:</span>
<span>###   &lt;input&gt;   Input file to read.</span>
<span>###   &lt;output&gt;  Output file to write. Use '-' for stdout.</span>
<span>###   -h        Show this message.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Halfway done, now need to get this message in runtime with sed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">help<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    sed -rn <span>'s/^### ?//;T;p'</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>$0</code> means a filename of a file that is being executed.</p>
<p>A bit about the magic that is going here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>s</code> — stands for substitute the following pattern;</li>
<li><code>/</code> — keyword to define start/end of the pattern;</li>
<li><code>^### ?</code> — match a string starting with ### and an optional space after;</li>
<li><code>//</code> — there could be something between the slashes, but since nothing is here, replace
the pattern with an empty string;</li>
<li><code>T</code> — Jumps to the end of sed-script if no s/// has done a successful substitution;</li>
<li><code>p</code> — Prints the result of the substitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just call the <code>help</code> function if an arg <code>-h</code> or no args passed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$#</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>]]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[[</span> <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"-h"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>

<p>^ <em>Animation improvements</em></p>
<p><a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In June, Veloren did a big interview with GamingOnLinux, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/interviewed-veloren-an-upcoming-foss-multiplayer-voxel-rpg">check it
out</a>! Veloren's lead artist also started a weekly blog
about his work on Veloren, which you can see <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weekly-blog-no-1-37819335">here</a>. Veloren recently
reached the <a href="https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/starred">first page</a> of most starred projects on Gitlab! The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRjlnKnSRRihWPPNasl_Qw">Veloren Youtube channel</a> also reached 1000
subscribers.</p>
<p>A lot has been done over the last month towards 0.7, which is slated to release
at the beginning of August. Lots of work has been done improving UI and
animations. These will help towards the goal of 0.7 being the "progression"
update. Many improvements have been made to the continuous integration system to
make it more reliable and faster. Mac support was added to Airshipper, the
Veloren launcher. Significant work was done on the world simulation front. This
includes economic simulations that will represent trade and resource pricing in
settlements and cities. Castle generation is also now in the works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-gamedev.github.io/posts/newsletter-011/veloren2.jpeg" alt="Work on castle generation"></p>
<p>Test coverage and documentation has started to improve, and a workflow around it
is being developed. The project is now hosting a <a href="https://docs.veloren.net/veloren_voxygen/index.html">proper documentation
site</a> that is updated with each merge. A #ux working group was
created to facilitate discussions on improvements to player interactions in
Veloren. Lots of translations were merged, including Swedish, Polish, and
Brazilian Portugese. The skill system is moving on to implementation, being a
coordinated effort between the game design, art, and combat working groups.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/netcan/AnimalChess">Animal Fight Chess</a> (斗兽棋, "Doe Show Chee") by <a href="https://github.com/netcan">@netcan</a>
is a Rust implementation of a popular Chinese game.</p>
<p>To win the game, one player must successfully move any animal into
the Den(兽穴) of the opponent or eat all animals of the opponent.
The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left, or right.
The pieces never move diagonally.
Each player has eight pieces,
<a href="http://ancientchess.com/graphics-rules/dou_shou_qi_jungle_game-pieces-values.jpg">different animals with different degrees of power</a>,
a larger power piece can eat a little power piece, but rat can eat elephant.
Here's a picture of the pieces, their English names,
and relative powers indicated by a number.

</ul>
<p>Before we get into practical tips on how to start, it is important to clarify
some concepts about journaling itself.</p>
<h2>What is journaling</h2>
<p>Put simply, journaling is the habit of writing about yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, writing about yourself can be very broad! Your journal might be a
simple record of what you do each day, or it might include your mood and
feelings, the weather, introspection, your thoughts about others, or what's
happening in the world.</p>
<p>Just talk to yourself while nobody is watching. Most often, you are talking to
your future self. On occasion, you may opt to share your thoughts with people
you trust. Later in this guide, we’ll discuss what to share and with whom, but
for now, treat your journal as a conversation with yourself.</p>
<h2>Why start journaling</h2>
<p>If you are reading a guide to start journaling, you probably already have an
idea of why you want to do it. Any reason is valid if it works for you, but
knowing why other people do it might strengthen your habit.</p>
<p>You might journal to deepen your understanding of yourself or your emotions, to
heal past hurts, or to cope with current challenges. It can help to organize
your ideas, make sense of what's happening in your life, and build a foundation
to make decisions. You can use it to track activities, develop healthy habits or
eliminate unhealthy ones, and understand how what you do relates to how you
feel. Or you might simply record life events and create memories that you can
revisit in a distant future. You could use your journal to exercise your
creativity, experiment with new ways of self-expression, ramble, or vent. Or, if
none of those reasons strike your fancy, you might choose to start a journal for
a brand new reason altogether.</p>
<h2>How to start journaling</h2>
<p>Developing a new habit is never easy. On one hand, you just have to start. The
problem is, some people are so good at starting, that they just keep starting
and starting and starting...</p>
<p>We hope that with our tips, you will start journaling definitively and not have
to start again!</p>
<h3>Give some thought to the reason you are journaling</h3>
<p>It can be anything, but you have to have a reason. If you can't explain to
yourself why you’re starting this, you probably won't be able to convince
yourself to keep doing it. Once you develop the habit you might discover new
reasons to maintain it, but you must already know at least one good reason to
start.</p>
<h3>The second day you write matters more than the first</h3>
<p>When you start journaling, you might put a lot of thought and time into that
first entry, but one entry doesn’t constitute journaling. Remember, journaling
is a habit, which means it continues for more than just a day. That first
journal entry is just a pre-requisite to what will eventually become a habit if
you do it again and again and again.</p>
<p>You should care a little bit less about what you write on the first day, but do
consider what you are going to write tomorrow. If you start thinking about what
you want to write tomorrow, you’re more likely to actually do it.</p>
<h3>Timebox the first days of writing</h3>
<p>Timeboxing is the technique of allocating a fixed amount of time to an activity.
In the first days of writing your journal entries, timebox your writing so you
don’t get overwhelmed—and keep it short, like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>You might feel inspired and be tempted to pour your heart out for hours to make
up for all the days that you haven’t written anything. Resist that temptation!
No marathon ever started with a sprint. You won't be capable of creating a daily
habit of something if it takes hours out of your day. If you set such a high bar
for yourself, you’ll feel pressure keep writing long and inspired entries, and
the pressure will make you quit.</p>
<p>While you are still forming the habit, don't abuse it. Long entries will
sometimes occur, but let it happen naturally once you have already formed the
habit.</p>
<h3>Set an alarm</h3>
<p>When you are starting a new habit it is not, by definition, part of your
routine. You won't naturally remember to do it, and the day will get away from
you. So set an alarm. Try to predict the time of day when you’re most likely to
do it—it usually fits best as one of the last parts of the day — and set a daily
reminder on your phone. Don't trust your memory tomorrow, take advantage of your
resolve today.</p>
<h3>Tell someone you started journaling</h3>
<p>A public announcement becomes a public commitment. Even if it is just one
person, it is one more person who can hold you accountable for your resolution.
If you can find someone who already has a journaling habit, even better.</p>
<h3>Don't worry if you miss a day, but never miss two in a row</h3>
<p>It is not a big deal to miss a day during that first week, or even two, as long
as they are not consecutive. Be diligent to never miss two days in a row. Having
a flawless streak of daily entries is motivating — so imagine how demotivating a
negative streak can be.</p>
<h3>After a few days, read your early entries</h3>
<p>When you read your first entries after a few days you will feel how rewarding is
to have a personal journal. You will understand much better the value of the
habit of journaling and you will imagine how you would feel reading the same
thing a year from now, then five years from now, or ten, or twenty. It’s
powerful!</p>

<h2><em>It’s Time to Watch the Watchmen – The Diversity Report of TechCrunch, Recode, The Information, Business Insider and Protocol.</em></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QTSx6MgSrYd5pwZwobk89Xec66X0GkNbYOHlVXsLtIl7k72caVj3WcuYrYU5eWrBc_LqSI2hj7n9-Z-5crONenrK8bPF6nQjAbPYgsXtnAppymJwHTVpYzXR0OR6M7FcKGRnjhwV" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><strong>The Big Dogs of Big Tech Media.</strong> <br>Clockwise from top left: Lessin of The Information, Swisher of Recode (Vox), Panzarino of TechCrunch, Shontell of Business Insider and Pierce of Protocol are Editors-in-Chief of the most influential tech publications in the world.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Prelude</h2>



<p><em>I have been writing about </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/"><em>Diversity in Tech for over a decade now</em></a><em> – a long time. However, my self-published posts have never really got the audience it was targeted at, which is, the Silicon Valley Main Street. This time around, I wanted to do something different with regard to distribution.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Since I completed this post over two weeks ago, I’ve hawked it as an Op-Ed to </em><strong><em>ALL</em></strong><em> main street US (Tech) media – 22 of them. Sadly, but unsurprisingly and understandably, I’ve had no takers. It is a big request to ask anyone, including journalists, to give a dissenting voice an audience, so I have decided to self-publish again, but this time around, I hope the primary intended audience gets to see it and the conversation happens. <strong>Abeg (please), share it</strong> as you wish me luck holding these very powerful people to account.</em></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>No thanks to the brutal execution of George Floyd and more importantly, thanks to the persistence of protesters, the conversation about institutional racism in various parts of American life is back to the fore and has been sustained. The tech industry has not been exempted.</p>



<p>As with previous cycles, it has cast blame towards the typical suspects: Big Tech and Venture Capital. And as with previous conversation cycles, one key player in the diversity deficient tech world is wriggling away unscathed, yet again. Silicon Valley Big Tech Media.</p>



<h2>Pattern Matching in Tech</h2>



<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is a colloquial terminology in the tech industry that refers to the propensity for established players in tech e.g. Venture Capitalists, taking superficial patterns of successful founders (young white boys who have dropped out of Stanford or Harvard) and using them to determine future investment decisions.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg”</p><cite><em>Paul Graham (According to The New York Times)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Though <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/tricked.html">eventually clarified by Paul Graham</a>, that attributed quote articulately captures the spirit of Pattern Matching. Since how one “looks” is one of the obvious patterns one can observe in a human, it is believed that pattern matching disproportionally affects “people of colour” (why do we use this term?).</p>



<p>I have no problem with pattern matching. In psychology it is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>, which is natural and critical for survival. It is how human beings recognise things and make vital decisions quickly, with little data.</p>



<p>My first memory of Pattern Matching was while playing football (the real one) as a kid. The guys with the bow-legged swagger, wearing boots and a shin guard were always picked first. It was almost automatic because they looked like talented footballers. And that’s how I learned to pick my teams. After missing out on some straight legged barefoot talents and picking several kitted-out clowns, I adjusted and used more sensible parameters.</p>



<p>I learned something from that though: Pattern matching is all well and good until it receives contradicting data. It’s all about the data.</p>



<h2>The Role of Big Tech Media in Pattern Matching</h2>



<p>In the past decade, Big Tech Media has rightfully shone the light on racial inequality in the ranks of Big Corporations and Venture Capital in the tech industry. The Diversity Reports — as they are known, of Big Tech and VC have been published routinely.</p>



<p>The media are very powerful. It is through them we learn and understand the world beyond ourselves. Their importance and power in shaping opinions cannot be overstated as they are very key in providing the data which influences patterns that lead to decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Tech, when it comes to personnel, a lot of that data comes in the form of presence. The Big Tech Media controls it all via narrative and coverage in their publications and mega conferences. It is through the media that every player – VCs, Tech Executives, Founders etc learn about the tech world that exists outside of their immediate spheres.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to the diversity in tech debate, I wonder: how have Big Tech Media, the primary opinion shapers of the tech industry, escaped any scrutiny? Then it hit me: when you are busy pointing your torch at others, you forget to point it at yourself.</p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media remains a critical piece if we are to rejig the data to alter diversity-deficient patterns in tech, it’s high-time we shone the light on Big Tech Media.</p>



<p><em>[RANDOM: Watching the film </em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a><em> made me almost cry. I had </em><strong><em>absolutely no idea</em></strong><em> that in the 60s, there were Black women mathematicians and programmers who were good enough to work for the NASA Space Program. Imagine if this was always common knowledge. I can only imagine how many more black folks it would have influenced to take up a career in Computer Science and Technology].</em></p>



<h2>Diversity Report of (Silicon Valley) Big Tech Media</h2>



<p>In 2015, I looked at <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2015/10/15/where-are-the-black-tech-foundersexecutive-speakers-at-major-tech-conferences/">the racial makeup of the largest tech conferences in the world</a>. The results were damning. I wondered how these organisers could be so oblivious. It then occurred to me to check out the people making these decisions, and it was clear why they were colour blind; they didn’t have the right ‘lenses’ i.e., makeup of the editorial/media team, to notice the absence of certain colours.</p>



<p>In this report card, I will look at the racial diversity makeup of both speaker line-ups and the editorial teams of Big Tech Media – who are mostly in Silicon Valley, and contrast their 2015 with today.</p>



<h2>The Candidates</h2>



<h3><strong>TechCrunch</strong></h3>



<p>TechCrunch, owned by AOL/Verizon has been the Big Dog of tech startup chronicling and commentary since 2005. More so, they host arguably the largest and most influential startup conference called Disrupt. I have followed TechCrunch since 2007 and experienced the startup evolution through them.</p>



<h3><strong>Recode</strong></h3>



<p>In the past decade, Recode has evolved from being All Things Digital at WSJ to being Independent to now being a unit at Vox Media. One constant throughout its evolution has been the very formidable Kara Swisher, who is arguably the single most influential person in Big Tech Media.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Information</strong></h3>



<p>This subscription-based tech publication is high up the list in shaping opinion among Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. It was started by Jessica Lessin who is a formidable reporter and an Alumnus of WSJ. They have a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/vc-diversity-index">VC Diversity Index</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Business Insider</strong></h3>



<p>Based in New York and founded by the great Henry Blodget, Business Insider is a top 3 tech voice in the tech industry.</p>



<h3><strong>Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>Backed by a bunch of heavyweights, this publication launched this year with a lot of panache.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How well have they done?</p>



<h2>Racial Diversity Report Card of Major US/Silicon Valley Tech Media</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6Bmj3M1sgqCR3PijCsyoYF5OrovGUDFEEujYSItZb0/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the data for this table</a> in spreadsheet format and links to sources.</p>







<p>It is good to highlight problems but better to proffer solutions. But first, do these people recognise that there is a problem? Do they want to solve it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015 when I wrote my previous post, I had the impression some did. In my <a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/738076047539896321">Twitter engagement with Kara Swisher</a> after my first post, Aunty Kara gave the patronising response by referencing “the adept use of social media” as a representation of Black in Tech, I offered to engage privately (I threw in my<a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/802151006754795520"> beer diplomacy</a> for good measure). It came to nought.</p>



<p><em>[Shalaye (Explanation): Aunty Kara took me up on the offer. As agreed, I reached out on 3 subsequent trips to the US and Silicon Valley. After sending about half a dozen emails, initially replied with excuses, Kara went cold and stopped responding. She is not the first Silicon Valley person whose Twitter (public) position contrasts with their private ones, so I haven’t taken it personally. I’d be more than happy to grab that beer if she’s open to it]</em></p>



<p>If Big Tech companies especially the media wish to change things, they have to first stop being colour-blind and get competent people who have eyes for the blind spots. A deliberate, sincere effort will yield good fruit.</p>



<p><strong>If you are a privileged person in the tech industry who wants to be a true “ally” and see things improve, here are some actionable things to do:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol><li>If you are on yet another panel and you notice the absence of accomplished Black tech players, speak up. Make recommendations. I am happy for you to ask me if your black network isn’t that vast. See Appendix (<strong>Note:</strong> Black folks have great competence about things outside the diversity topic).</li><li>If you are a VC and you are in on a good deal, try to work with the founder and carve out an allocation for those good black investors that aren’t as opportune to have your network. We all know the deal flow is the <em>koko (main thing).</em> If you want to help, share the deal.</li><li>If you are recruiting for a senior role in your executive team or board, you can take a book from the NFL beyond Colin Kaepernick’s brave kneeling protest; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule">Rooney Rule</a>. Just make sure you have a qualified black person in your interview shortlist. That’s not too much of an ask.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>I wrote in an email to my white founder friend recently: <em>I see many organisations “fighting” systemic racism by opening their cheque books. A donation here, a freebie there. It makes them feel good, perhaps. It’s like a retweet but with money.</em></p>



<p>So, decide if you want to show concern or effect change. I prefer both.</p>







<ol><li>Every company (including Big Tech Media) has the prerogative to invite or cover anyone they like. However, the proprietors of Tech Media cannot play watchmen and feign concern about the diversity in tech debate while their actions are in direct contrast.</li><li>In this post, I focused on these …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>Around 1.5 years ago, I did an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">analysis of YouTube trending videos</a> in US. That analysis was performed on trending videos of some months in 2017 and 2018. The analysis received a lot of interest on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">Kaggle</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9kpmcn/i_analyzed_more_than_40000_youtube_trending/">Reddit</a>; I also received some emails praising the work done. That was 1.5 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Today</strong>, I present an improved and expanded version of that analysis. This analysis is more advanced and contains new interesting elements. In this analysis, <strong>All trending videos for the whole year of 2019</strong> were analyzed (More than <strong>70,000</strong> videos).</p>

<p>Titles, descriptions, thumbnails, tags, views, likes/dislikes, and comments were all analyzed to produce the results shown in this post. Continue reading to know more about the analysis and the data or you can <a href="#analysis-res">jump directly to the results section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-youtube-trending-videos">What are YouTube Trending Videos?</h2>

<p>YouTube, as you know, is the most popular and most used video platform in the world today. YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending">a list of <strong>trending videos</strong></a>. I’ll quote the description of trending videos from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en">YouTube itself</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trending helps viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending isn’t personalized and displays the same list of trending videos in each country to all users.</p>

  <p>The list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="goals-of-the-analysis">Goals of the Analysis</h2>

<p>The main goal of the analysis is to find interesting facts and patterns by exploring the data and by using effective visualizations.</p>

<p>Some of the questions the analysis will answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the average/minimum/maximum view count for 2019’s trending videos?</li>
  <li>Which videos appeared on the trending list the most (because some videos might appear on the trending list for more than one day)?</li>
  <li>What are the most common words in the titles/descriptions/tags of trending videos?</li>
  <li>What are the title lengths of the trending videos? What is the average/minimum/maximum title length?</li>
  <li>Which channels have more trending videos than others?</li>
  <li>What are the top categories of trending videos? Are “Entertainment” videos more trending than “Gaming” videos?</li>
  <li>How many views/comments/likes trending videos have when first appearing on the trending list?</li>
  <li>How many days are between publishing a video and its first appearance on the trending list?</li>
  <li>How long are the descriptions/tags of trending videos?</li>
  <li>What are the most used colors in the thumbnails of trending videos?</li>
  <li>What are the most common objects in the thumbnails of trending videos? (Running AI object detection algorithm on all thumbnails)</li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis covers much more topics as you will see soon.</p>



<p>This analysis was performed using Python and a powerful group of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, ImageAI, WordCloud, and more.</p>

<p>The analysis were performed in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h3 id="code-used">Code Used</h3>

<p>You can find all the code used for this analysis in a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://github.com/ammar1y/YouTube-Trending-Videos-Analysis-2019">on this link</a>. Feel free to read the code and re-use it however you want. Also note that the notebook contains more analyses than the ones shown here in this post, so if you want to see everything, refer to the notebook after you finish reading this post.</p>

<h2 id="data-source">Data Source</h2>

<p>The data used in this analysis was retrieved using YouTube API. A script was scheduled to run <strong>each day throughout 2019 and fetch data from YouTube API about the trending videos of that day</strong>. The script would then process the data received from YouTube and store them in text files.</p>

<p>The scraping script is not my work. It can be found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper"> Trending-YouTube-Scraper</a>. I put the script on a AWS EC2 instance and scheduled it—using Crontab—to run every day at a specific time.</p>

<p>After 2019 ended, I connected to the AWS instance using FileZilla application and downloaded all the data produced by the script. There was a file for each day of 2019. To perform the analysis, I needed to process the data in order to merge the files into a single CSV file.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>download the data used in this analysis</strong> which describes 2019's trending videos in the United States, you can buy it securely on Gumroad <u><strong><a href="https://gum.co/qEzKK" target="_blank">on this link</a></strong></u> or by using the button below. Along with United States, you'll also get trending-videos data for United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries as well.</p>

<h2 id="data-size-and-description">Data Size and Description</h2>

<p><strong>In this post, United-States trending videos will be analyzed</strong>, which constitute a total of <strong>72,994</strong> videos. YouTube usually place 200 videos in the trending list each day which would mean that we should have 73,000 (365 x 200) videos. We have 72,994. This is probably because on a few days, the number of Trending videos was slightly less than 200.</p>

<p>So we have data on 72,994 trending videos to analyze. On YouTube, <strong>the same video might appear on the trending list for many days. This means that the 72,994 videos are not unique videos</strong>. In fact, among the 72,994 videos, <strong>we have 11,177 unique videos</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, 11,177 videos showed on the trending list throughout 2019. Some of them might have stayed on the list for 10 days, some for 20 days, etc. We will see later in the analysis more info about this.</p>

<p>The following table shows an example of <strong>the data that we have for each video</strong>:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p><br>
As we can see, we have the ID of the video which is a unique value for the video across YouTube (No two videos have the same ID). We also have the title of the video, its publishing date and time, the channel that published it, its category, and its description and tags. We also have the number of the views, likes, dislikes, and comments of the video. There are also a few more data shown in the table.</p>

<p>We can see that there is a field named “trending_date”. This field specifies the date on which this video was trending. As we said earlier, the same video might appear on the trending-videos list for more than one day. This means that we might find another record in the data for the same video ID but with different “trending_date” and maybe different number of views, comments, likes, etc. (because those numbers are likely to increase from one day to another).</p>



<h2 id="analysis-results">Analysis Results</h2>

<p>Now let’s start the best part of this post, let’s see the analysis results.</p>

<p><span id="note-uniq"></span><strong>Please note</strong> that for the following analyses, <strong>unless otherwise stated</strong>, we applied the analysis on all of the <strong>72,994</strong> trending videos, <strong>not</strong> on the unique trending videos only. The reasoning behind this is that we are interested in videos considered trending by YouTube. So if a video is considered trending for 3 days, then we believe that it has more trending power and more trending characteristics than a video that was trending for 1 day only; thus, it should have more weight. So <strong>we include the 3 occurrences of that video in the analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>For some analyses, considering only unique videos is more appropriate. When that is the case, you will see a note telling you about that.</p>

<h3 id="trending-videos-and-views">Trending Videos and Views</h3>

<p><strong>The Trending Video with the Highest Number of Views</strong> is a song by BTS band named “Boy With Luv”. The video was published on 12/April/2019 and on 23/04/2019, it appeared on the trending list with 195,376,667 views which is the highest number of views a trending video had in 2019.</p>

<p>In the table below, you can see <strong>the top 3 trending videos based on the number of views</strong>. These trending videos had views when they appeared on the trending list more than any other trending video. This table was produced by considering unique trending videos only (<a href="#note-uniq">For more</a>).</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-top-views.png" alt=""></p>



<p>And now we will look at the distribution of views for trending videos. The histogram below shows this distribution:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-view-dist.png" alt=""></p>



<p><em>Notice that the y-axis is <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/logarithmic-scale.html">log scaled</a>. It is 10, 100, 1000… not 10, 20, 30…</em></p>

<p>We can see that the vast majority of trending videos had less than 20 million views when they became trending. In fact, when they became trending, around <strong>94% of trending videos had less than 10 million views</strong> and around 99.9% had less than 100 million views.</p>

<p>Now, we might ask: <strong>What are the trending videos with the least amount of views?</strong> The table below shows the 3 trending videos with the lowest number of views when appearing on the trending list. This table was produced by considering unique trending videos only (<a href="#note-uniq">For more</a>).</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-least-views.png" alt=""></p>



<p>You can see that these three videos appeared on the trending list on the same day they were published on. Maybe they received a high number of views in the first few hours after they were published which sent them to the trending list.</p>

<h4 id="how-many-views-videos-had-when-they-first-became-trending">How Many Views Videos Had When they First Became Trending?</h4>

<p>We mentioned earlier that there were many videos that appeared on the trending list on more than one day. We now want to consider the first appearance only of each video. We …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

       This style guide contains many details
       that are initially hidden from view.
       They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your left.

<category title="Background">
  <p>
    Common Lisp is a powerful multiparadigm programming language.
    With great power comes great responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide recommends formatting and stylistic choices
    designed to make your code easier for other people to understand.
    For those internal applications and free software libraries that
    we develop at Google,
    you should keep within these guidelines when making changes.
    Note however that each project has its own rules and customs
    that complement or override these general guidelines;
    the speed-oriented QPX low fare search engine notably
    has a very different style and feel from the QRes reservation system.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're writing Common Lisp code outside Google,
    we invite you to consider these guidelines.
    You may find some of them useful
    where they don't conflict with other priorities you have.
    We welcome remarks and constructive feedback
    on how to improve our guide, and
    on what alternate styles work for you and why.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This guide is not a Common Lisp tutorial.
    For basic information about the language, please consult
    <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>.
    For a language reference, please consult the
    <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common Lisp HyperSpec</a>.
    For more detailed style guidance, take (with a pinch of salt)
    a look at Peter Norvig and Kent Pitman's
    <a href="http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">style guide</a>.

  <stylepoint title="Must, Should, May, or Not">
    <summary>
      Each guideline's level of importance is indicated
      by use of the following keywords and phrases, adapted from
      <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.

              This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL",
              means that the guideline is an absolute requirement.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST.

              This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT",

    <summary>
      There are cases where transgression of some of these rules

      In some cases, you must seek permission or obtain forgiveness
      from the proper people.

      You MUST follow conventions. They are not optional.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Some of these guidelines are motivated by universal principles of good programming.
        Some guidelines are motivated by technical peculiarities of Common Lisp.
        Some guidelines were once motivated by a technical reason,
        but the guideline remained after the reason subsided.
        Some guidelines, such those about as comments and indentation,
        are based purely on convention, rather than on clear technical merit.
        Whatever the case may be, you must still follow these guidelines,
        as well as other conventional guidelines
        that have not been formalized in this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You MUST follow conventions.
        They are important for readability.
        When conventions are followed by default,
        violations of the convention are a signal
        that something notable is happening and deserves attention.
        When conventions are systematically violated,
        violations of the convention are a distracting noise
        that needs to be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conventional guidelines <em>are</em> indoctrination.
        Their purpose is to make you follow the mores of the community,
        
        so you can more effectively cooperate with existing members.
        It is still useful to distinguish the parts that are technically motivated
        from the parts that are mere conventions,
        so you know when best to defy conventions for good effect,
        and when not to fall into the pitfalls that the conventions are there to help avoid.

      </p>
      <p>
        You must not fix violations en masse
        without warning other developers and coordinating with them,

<category title="General Guidelines">
  <stylepoint title="Principles">
    <summary>
      There are some basic principles for team software development
      that every developer must keep in mind.
      Whenever the detailed guidelines are inadequate, confusing or contradictory,
      refer back to these principles for guidance:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every developer's code must be easy for another developer
          to read, understand, and modify
          â€” even if the first developer isn't around to explain it.
          (This is the "hit by a truck" principle.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody's code should look the same.
          Ideally, there should be no way to look at lines of code
          and recognize it as "Fred's code" by its style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be precise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
          KISS â€” Keep It Simple, Stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the smallest hammer for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use common sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep related code together.
          Minimize the amount of jumping around
          someone has to do to understand an area of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Priorities">
    <summary>
      <p>
        When making decisions about how to write a given piece of
        code, aim for the following -ilities in this priority order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usability by the customer
        </li>
        <li>
          Debuggability/Testability
        </li>
        <li>
          Readability/Comprehensibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensibility/Modifiability
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency (of the Lisp code at runtime)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Most of these are obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usability by the customer means that the system has to do what the
        customer requires; it has to handle the customer's transaction
        volumes, uptime requirements; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Lisp efficiency point,
        given two options of equivalent complexity,
        pick the one that performs better.
        (This is often the same as the one that conses less,
        i.e. allocates less storage from the heap.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Given two options where one is more complex than the other,
        pick the simpler option and revisit the decision only if
        profiling shows it to be a performance bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, avoid premature optimization.
        Don't add complexity to speed up something that runs rarely,
        since in the long run, it matters less whether such …</p></stylepoint></category></div></div>

<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span>In cybersecurity, news regarding new vulnerabilities appears </span><span>continuously every day</span><span> through an array of various sources, be it news networks, social networks, blogs, security advisories, etc. These fall under the umbrella of open-source intelligence (OSINT). Yet not all vulnerabilities generate the same level of interest and length of discussion.</span></p>
<p><span>As such, one interesting aspect of vulnerability prioritization is to consider what types of vulnerabilities are currently trending in these OSINT sources, in order to establish the types of vulnerabilities an attacker might favor.&nbsp; For example, if discussions in public sources and underground networks currently mention reflected XSS attacks on particular frameworks more often than usual, then other attackers reading these discussions could be tempted to attack other similar XSS vulnerabilities, or find similar inflection points in other frameworks. Attackers, just like cybersecurity experts, are very much influenced by trends in exploitation methods.</span></p>
<p><span>This blogpost explains in part how </span><a href="https://delvesecurity.com/delves-vulnerability-threat-intelligence-feed/"><span>Delve's Vulnerability Threat Intelligence Feed</span></a><span> identifies the top trending vulnerabilities on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the approach presented in this blog is to identify the patterns or trends underlying online discussions. These are what we aim to model in order to generalize which vulnerabilities might receive more attention from attackers, regardless of the vulnerability’s direct mentions (e.g., its CVE number) in online discussions. The goal is the identification of the underlying concepts associated with online cybersecurity discussions, first to assess the importance of existing vulnerabilities, and second to use this representation as input to future predictive models. To extract this information, a natural language approach is employed, which uses machine learning, and more specifically,</span><i><span> topic modeling</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In short, it is possible to build a representation of a vulnerability that captures both its intrinsic features as well as its relationship with the external world.</span></p>
<p><span>This framework aims to:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Create a representation that encodes the semantic meaning of vulnerabilities, i.e., topics from the textual descriptions of all disclosed vulnerabilities to date.</span></li>
<li><span>Crawl online infosec discussions and apply them to a topic model, so as to obtain a weighted list of topics, which we call </span><i><span>trends</span></i><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Combine the previously-built trends to their respective topics in a vulnerability, in order to indicate its importance to current infosec discussions.</span></li>
<li><span>Use these trends and topics in future machine learning projects as input features</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span>In order to accomplish these goals, we can use topic modeling, which is an unsupervised machine learning technique where a number of topics are automatically extracted from a text corpus, along with each one’s probability to appear in any of the texts. A </span><i><span>topic</span></i><span> consists of one or more weighted words, where a higher weight indicates a higher importance to the topic. A topic represents an underlying concept extracted from the text through statistical analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, there are a great number of disclosed buffer overflow vulnerabilities out there, each with a different but similar description. This technique can capture a generic topic representing the words associated with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, looking somewhat like this:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_4694"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4694" src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1.png" alt="" width="596" height="450" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1.png 596w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1-300x227.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1-100x76.png 100w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1-550x415.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-4694"><strong>Figure 1: An example of a buffer overflow topic</strong></p></div>
<p><span>A prominent topic modeling technique is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is a generative model that computes the probability of a word being associated with a topic[1]. LDA has been proven effective in previous research and applications[2,3], and is one of the most common topic modeling methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Creating the Topic Model&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>First, let’s extract the textual definition of all vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) of the NIST, each associated with a CVE number. These texts are then processed, as depicted by Figure 2. In step 1, URLs and common words are removed, the text is split into tokens (single words), and the words are lemmatized</span><span> (<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html">Stanford</a>) to group together different inflections of a word.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2.png" alt="" width="591" height="101" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2.png 591w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2-300x51.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2-100x17.png 100w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2-550x94.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Filtering of a description’s words, and splitting into tokens</strong></p>
<p><span>These lists of tokens can then be transformed into a numerical representation using the bag-of-words model, as depicted in Figure 3. In this new representation, each token is identified by an ID and its number of occurrences, where the ID is chosen based on its first appearance in the definitions. This transformation is necessary since LDA requires numerical inputs.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3.png" alt="" width="512" height="82" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3.png 512w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3-300x48.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3-100x16.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Transformation of a description’s tokens into a numerical representation</strong></p>
<p><span>These are then used as input to LDA, as shown in Figure 4, which generates a set of topics identified by a series of words and an importance factor between 0 and 1. This model is implemented using online learning, where new published vulnerabilities are fed to the model daily and the model is updated incrementally.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image.png" alt="" width="531" height="292" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image.png 531w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image-300x165.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image-100x55.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4: Association of words in numerical form to their topics through LDA</strong></p>
<h3><span>Building Trends from Online Discussions</span></h3>
<p><span>Once we have learned a suitable model for vulnerabilities, one that understands the specifics of language in the description of vulnerabilities, we gather online discussions of vulnerabilities and exploitations from various public sources. While a number of previous works have extracted information from online discussions in order to build models[4,5,6,7], none applied them to a topic model in the same way this blog details. Now, let’s process text posts from discussions in the same way as specified in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and apply them to the existing topic model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This results in a vector of weights for each text post, where each topic’s importance to this discussion is expressed by a number between 0 and 1, named a </span><i><span>weight</span></i><span>. By averaging these vectors together across all posts, we obtain a final single vector denoting the relative importance of each of our topics in what we observe in online discussions. We call those “trends”. In the end, by extracting the topics with the highest weights, we obtain the set of current trends. Figure 5 describes the creation of trends:</span></p>

<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5.png" alt="" width="471" height="271" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5.png 471w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5-300x173.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5-100x58.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: The creation of a trends score from online discussions</strong></p>
<h3><span>Scoring Vulnerabilities</span></h3>
<p><span>Finally, we look back at the vulnerabilities from the NIST database which were used to build the initial topic model, and identify the ones with topics matching the newly established trends. This is done by applying the dot product to each vulnerability topic vector and the trends vector, or in slightly more human language, by computing the product of each of a vulnerability’s topic weights and its corresponding trend weights, and summing them. This gives us a final Vulnerability Trends Score (VTS).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The higher the VTS is, the more closely this vulnerability matches with online discussions.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6.png" alt="" width="533" height="301" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6.png 533w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6-300x169.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6-100x56.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6: The dot product between the vulnerability topics and the trends</strong></p>
<p><span>The framework can be summarized in the figure below. First, the topic model is trained with vulnerability descriptions, and outputs a number of topics:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7.png" alt="" width="512" height="351" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7.png 512w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7-300x206.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7-100x69.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></p>
<p><span>Second, online discussions are run through the same topic model to establish which of the previously obtained topics are most important for these discussions:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8.png" alt="" width="532" height="365" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8.png 532w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8-300x206.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8-100x69.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 7: Overview of the approach</strong></p>
<h3><span>Example of a Use Case</span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s see how this works in practice: 30 topics (why 30? See the Appendix below) were identified on all of NIST’s vulnerabilities, each identifying a concept observed in vulnerability descriptions. Then, data was gathered from online discussions, such as these tweets from Twitter :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We have created the first write-up on the recent Apache Tomcat RCE (CVE-2020-9484), read here: [url] #infosec #javahacking #exploit #tomcat #deserialization #webapplicationhacking #vulnerability</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Security Bulletin: Open Source Apache Tomcat vulnerabilities affect IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (CVE-2020-1938) [url] Multiple vulnerabilities in Open Source Apache Tomcat reported by The Apache Software Foundation [url]</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Apache Tomcat AJP Vulnerability (CNVD-2020-10487/CVE-2020-1938)&nbsp; (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1938">NIST</a>) .This vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher of Chaitin Tech . You can read any webapps files or include a file to RCE .JUST A POC-GIF with no DETAILS Tomcat has fix this vulnerability ,UPDATE! [url]"</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>When applying the topic model to these tweets, a weight for every topic of the model is obtained, relative to&nbsp; these specific tweets. This is what we identify as </span><i><span>trends</span></i><span>. Among others, these three topics, in a human-interpretable form, came out as important:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Topic A</b><span>, related to file upload vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li><b>Topic B</b><span>, related to applications having default settings and making HTTP requests&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Topic D</b><span>, related to code execution vulnerabilities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Finally, we can use the trends and the vulnerabilities’ topics to obtain a VTS for each vulnerability, using the method described previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The top-ranked vulnerability comes out as CVE-2020-1938</span><span>, which identifies an Apache Tomcat vulnerability, code-named Ghostcat, enabling attackers to upload files through a default connection, and potentially obtain a remote code execution. The following figure illustrates the evolution of this specific vulnerability over the month of June 2020:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9.png" alt="" width="392" height="300" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9.png 392w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9-300x230.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9-100x77.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px"><strong>Figure 8: The evolution of CVE-2020-1938’s VTS score over the month of June</strong></p>
<p><span>This vulnerability appearing as the most important is expected, given that many tweets mention Tomcat vulnerabilities, and some directly speak of this vulnerability. More interestingly, other vulnerabilities matching with topics A, B and D will also have a high trending score, while not necessarily being the most mentioned online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Results</span></h2>
<p><span>With a model trained in early June 2020, the top trending topics obtained are shown in Figure 9 as word clouds. The model is trained everyday to observe the evolution of trends.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-10.png" alt="" width="563" height="475" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-10.png 563w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-10-300x253.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-10-100x84.png 100w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-10-550x464.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px"></p>

<p>As of the 5th July 2020, there are 1357 Tor bridges available for users in countries who censor the Tor network to use. Having just over 1,000 IP addresses is not a lot for such a big privacy network as Tor is, especially considering that the number of Tor Bridges peaked at 4,227 on the 4th January 2015. That means since then the network has lost more than two-thirds of its bridges.</p>
<p>The lack of bridges only makes it harder for people in oppressive countries to take advantage of both the anti-censorship and anonymizing power of the Tor network. In light of this, many people including the Tor project themselves have been trying to convince more people to become bridge operators.</p>
<p>This article will go over some ultra-cheap VPS hosts that will allow anyone to become a bridge operators without having to spend a sizeable amount of money;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/storefront-qr-code.jpg" alt="A restaurant storefront with QR code posters fixed to the door"></p><p>COVID-19 didn’t start the drive towards a more automated, touchless future, but it certainly hastened it. In the US, QR codes and NFC were often viewed as a <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/marketer-love-qr-codes-shared-consumers/231854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice-to-have or novelty</a>. Now, you’d be hard-pressed to walk down a street full of businesses and not see QR codes on storefront windows offering core business interactions as new, contactless experiences.</p> <p>It’s early-days, though, and solutions of varying sophistication are popping up all over the place. I thought I’d document some of the traditionally physical and person-to-person interactions we’ve observed getting the touchless treatment, and highlight some of the emerging hallmarks of good, contactless interaction design (Spoiler: general <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interaction design guidelines</a> still apply).</p> <p>Let’s get started.</p> <h2 id="check-ins-and-wait-lists"><a href="#check-ins-and-wait-lists">#</a> Check-ins and wait-lists</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/check-in-wait-list.jpg" alt="A tablet at a restaurant prompting customers to check in by entering a name and phone number" width="40%"></p><p>What’s the first thing you encounter when you walk into a hotel, restaurant, or office? It’s likely a check-in flow. Do you have a reservation? Who are you here to see? How many are in your party? These interactions often involve talking to a receptionist and using a pen on paper or a shared tablet.</p> <p>This interaction can be relatively easy to automate. In fact, pre-COVID, tablets were appearing in all sorts of businesses, from restaurants to corporate offices, that allowed check-in without the need for human interaction. While the concept is sound, customers are now hesitant to touch a surface shared with countless others.</p> <p>Now, these tablets are beginning to use QR codes that can be scanned by a kiosk, allowing people to sign in from their own device. Unfortunately, many solutions require an app and oftentimes an account or exchange of personal information to use them. We’ll get into why this is bad a bit later.</p> <h2 id="curbside-pickup"><a href="#curbside-pickup">#</a> Curbside pickup</h2> <p>Curbside pickup isn’t new, but it has certainly expanded during the pandemic. Put simply, a customer should be able to order and pay electronically, get notified when their order is available, and provide some notification for the order to be delivered to their vehicle.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/curbside-pickup.jpg" alt="Buckets with posts and signs in a retailer's parking lot instructing customers to call when they arrive"></p><p>It’s now common to see reserved parking spaces and signage with instructions to call a number with the order ID and parking space or tap a button in an app to type the information in. <a href="https://blog.routegy.com/2020/06/30/examination-curbside-pickup-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As we wrote previously</a>, these experiences require unnecessary overhead, burden customers by requesting redundant information, and tie up phone lines, resulting in lost orders and revenue.</p> <p>Some solutions use geofencing to track when customers leave for the location and arrive, but this too has issues, as they require customers to have an app and allow access to fine-grained location information. Besides battery and privacy concerns, this can be confusing. Do customers open the app and let you know when they’re leaving? Do they have to keep the app open? Who else can access their location information? The goal is to make it easy for customers, not instill uncertainty and doubt.</p> <h2 id="menus-table-service-and-payments"><a href="#menus-table-service-and-payments">#</a> Menus, table service, and payments</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/contactless-pos-gas-station.jpg" alt="A QR code on a fuel pump at a gas station offering a link to install an app for payment instead of using the keypad" width="60%"></p><p>We’re all familiar with handling physical menus (the condition of which can vary wildly, from pristine to yikes) and talking to servers throughout a meal, from ordering to asking for refills to paying the check. It’s easy to think of menus and service as specific to restaurants and retail, but the high-level concepts apply more broadly. Basically, any interaction that allows people to select options and pay for goods or services is being rethought. Think stadiums, theme parks, theaters, and so on.</p> <p>Restaurants are now placing QR codes on tables that point to their webpages or install a 3rd party app to enable a virtual menu and ordering system. A restaurant webpage isn’t likely to be interactive or allow for selection, so human interaction is still required. Apps provide interactive menus and POS functionality, but require a download, account creation, and the overhead that comes along with it.</p> <h2 id="requests-and-issue-reporting"><a href="#requests-and-issue-reporting">#</a> Requests and issue reporting</h2> <p>Where do people go when they need something or want to report a facility issue? Before, even in large companies with ticketing systems, it was often easiest to just tap someone on the shoulder. This particular interaction was already pretty bad (imagine being the someone whose shoulder is constantly getting tapped), and now it comes with a health risk.</p> <p>Besides requiring social distancing or using Slack/email/voice, the interaction is still problematic in terms of efficiency, just as it was pre-COVID. Ideally, people would make requests and report issues in a contextual way with their own devices without the need to navigate a ticketing system or go find someone to help. Need something or see something? Scan or tap this sign to let us know!</p> <h2 id="surveys-and-feedback"><a href="#surveys-and-feedback">#</a> Surveys and feedback</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/customer-feedback-survey.jpg" alt="A sign in a doorway asking for customer feedback with a QR code" width="50%"></p><p>How do we know how we’re doing and how we can improve? One of the best ways is to simply ask. Customer and employee feedback is invaluable, and it’s typically gathered via paper forms, shared tablets, or other physical interactions (E.g. the Happy or Not kiosks you encounter at airport restrooms).</p> <p>Contactless ways of gathering feedback via email and text already exist, of course, but those require personal information and also lack context, typically showing up when it’s convenient for us, not when it’s relevant to them. Ideally we would collect feedback in the moment, and do so in a safe way.</p> <p>Some basic solutions have begun to show up, like QR codes that point to Google forms. While you may get the data you need, you’ll still need to figure out how to format and import that information into your workflow.</p> <h2 id="so-what-makes-a-good-touchless-interaction"><a href="#so-what-makes-a-good-touchless-interaction">#</a> So, what makes a good, touchless interaction?</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/routegy-request-qr-nfc.jpg" alt="A QR code and NFC tag are mounted to a wall, prompting visitors to interact via their phone to make requests"></p><p>People are used to face-to-face interactions when they need something. Introducing technology into the equation is inevitably going to complicate things, especially at first. So what should we consider to minimize the impact, increase safety and comfort, and ease folks into this new world?</p> <h4 id="low-friction"><a href="#low-friction">#</a> Low friction</h4> <p>Requiring apps and accounts is a burden. Unless you’re confident that a large percentage of your customers already have your app installed (and actually like it vs. installing it begrudgingly), avoid requiring an app installation. Similarly, unless absolutely necessary, do not require account creation or sign-in. Oftentimes the information you need to serve and communicate with your customers can be achieved without the extra hurdles.</p> <h4 id="intuitive"><a href="#intuitive">#</a> Intuitive</h4> <p>Most people are not used to pulling out their phone to accomplish traditionally touch-heavy tasks, let alone using it to scan QR codes and tap NFC tags. Despite most modern devices supporting these functions natively, we must educate customers. Clear signage and instruction works wonders here. But the experience doesn’t end there, does it? We also need to be mindful to offer data entry that is <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/web/policies-and-standards/hhs-web-policies/accessibility/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessible</a>, easy to navigate on a phone, and that doesn’t collect unnecessary information we can collect contextually and automatically.</p> <h4 id="fast"><a href="#fast">#</a> Fast</h4> <p>Talking to someone typically has instant feedback and gratification. With a touchless experience, it’s difficult to know who or what is on the receiving end of the communication, so it’s important to set expectations and deliver on them. Is this going to contact staff inside? Do we expect that this might take a few minutes? Tell people up front and eliminate confusion.</p> <h4 id="long-term-design"><a href="#long-term-design">#</a> Long-Term design</h4> <p>It’s tempting to slap something together as a temporary stop-gap until a vaccine is discovered, but that’s doing a disservice to your customers and to your business. Many, if not all, of the interactions we’ve discussed have benefits that go beyond limiting the spread of the virus. Done right, touchless interactions deliver better experiences because they streamline interactions and enable staff to focus on more important things while respecting your customers’ time and privacy.</p> <h4 id="automated"><a href="#automated">#</a> Automated</h4> <p>Consider whether the interaction can be accomplished without any data input at all (E.g. requesting a bellhop or flight attendant, reporting a bathroom in need of attention, or marking a desk as occupied), and make the interaction as simple as possible.

      <p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to millions of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p>

<p>“Umm…that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p>

<p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p>

<p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p>

<p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t?</p>

<p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p>

<p>For some reason no one talks about these challenges with interviewing. But I’ve found some principles that help me over and over again:</p>

<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li>
  <li>Going to real interviews for practice</li>
  <li>Being open to learning during interviews</li>
  <li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li>
</ul>



<p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p>

<p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p>

<p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you’ve already passed that bar</p>

<p>Now the recruiter wants to work with you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and they’re happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard a strong candidate who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p>

<p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li>
  <li>“I’m interested in X, Y, &amp; Z. What other companies are hiring?” (Only try this if the recruiter reached out to you first, they work for a recruiting agency, and you haven’t had your interview yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you can be forthright about any problems you run into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you’re at your best!</li>
  <li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they’ll say “sorry, we can’t do that”. It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p>



<p>You need to build up your interview skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don’t limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p>

<p>When you’re in a real interview the world changes: You’re locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing to break free. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous “Would you like something to drink?” is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p>

<p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you’ll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You’ll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p>

<p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn’t look so fierce. I’ve found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don’t care about the outcome. I’m much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don’t really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p>

<p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on ones which have no clear right answer, such as behavioral and design questions. Think about how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p>

<p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you’ll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you’ll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture demonstrating just how valuable an asset you can be to their company.</p>

<p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p>

<p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t care for the company. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they’d suggest.</p>

<p>And I did. More than once.</p>



<p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p>

<p>I was wandering around the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I’d never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn’t just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik’s cube in hand. That evening Vince called me up offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought “Sure, why not? I could use the experience”</p>

<p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I’d ask “I don’t think I did so great here. What’s the right answer to this problem?” (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p>

<p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company’s name: Bloomberg</p>

<p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you’ll be able to find another one quickly. That’s a huge stress off your back.</p>

<p>I haven’t been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I’ll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don’t bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p>

<p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudo code written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don’t have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like “create an array” tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what’s my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p>

<p>What hadn’t occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p>

<p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In Part 2 of our comparison of Python and go from a Data Engineering perspective, we’ll finally take a look at Apache Beam and Google Dataflow and how the go SDK and the Python SDK differ, what drawbacks we’re dealing with, how fast it is by running extensive benchmarks,and how feasible it is to make the switch.</p><blockquote><p>You can find <a href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/06/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-1/">Part 1 here</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="apache-beam--google-dataflow">Apache Beam &amp; Google Dataflow</h2><p>While we have used <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> on several occasions <a href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2018/06/analyzing-reddits-top-posts-images-with-google-cloud-part-1/#introducing-data-flow">before</a>, allow me to give another short introduction.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beam’s supported distributed processing back-ends, which include Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.</p><p><a href="https://beam.apache.org/get-started/beam-overview/">https://beam.apache.org/get-started/beam-overview/</a></p></blockquote><p>Beam can be used for a variety of data use cases, not unlike Apache Spark - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, stream analytics, or simple data movement from, for instance, a file system to an RDMBS.</p><h2 id="why-beam-is-interesting">Why Beam is interesting</h2><p>One of the best professional advice I ever got is to ask “So What?". That being said: So what, why do I care about Beam?</p><p>For me, one of the most interesting aspects of Beam’s model is the decoupling of pipeline logic, language, and execution environment. I can design my logic on a piece of paper (i.e., draw a <code>DAG</code> with some <code>Beam</code>-specific terminology - we’ll do that in a second), implement it in any of the major languages - even multiple - and run it on any of the supported <code>Runners</code>.</p><p>The last time we used it on this blog, we used it to write a Pipeline to analyze reddit posts and executed it on the <code>Dataflow</code> runner as such:</p><p><img src="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/07/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-2-dataflow/images/dataflow-old.png" alt="dataflow-old.png"></p><p>As this pipeline was written in Python, there is nothing stopping us from running <em>the exact same job</em> on a on-premise Hadoop cluster, on AWS EMR, or just run it locally using the <code>DirectRunner</code>. This level of portability, in combination with a programming model that I happen to find more streamlined than say <code>Spark</code>'s, makes <code>Beam</code> a very interesting framework.</p><p>We’ll actually do exactly that in the example section of this article and design a pipeline, write it in both <code>Python</code> and <code>go</code>, and run it on different <code>Runners</code>.</p><h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2><p>Everything in <code>Beam</code> starts with a <code>Pipeline.</code> The <code>Beam</code> programming model works by exposing high-level abstractions through code that allow your <code>Pipeline</code> to execute a graph of <code>PTransforms</code> on a given dataset, which in term is operating on immutable collections, called <code>PCollections</code>, which can be moved to a persistent state through <code>IO</code> operations. Jobs can be executed on different <code>Runners</code> to provide a (distributed) execution environment.</p><p>Let’s dig into those concepts before we look at a real-world example.</p><blockquote><p>This is a condensed version of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/">official Apache Beam documentation</a>, which I suggest you read in full for a more in-depth view</p></blockquote><h3 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h3><p>A <code>Pipeline</code> object is the starting point of any job, which is usually initialized with a <code>configuration</code> object that defines <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> your pipeline runs.</p><h3 id="pcollections">PCollections</h3><p>A <code>PCollection</code>, not unlike a Spark <code>RDD</code> or <code>DataFrame</code>, are immutable collections of data that can be modified in-memory through the lifecycle of a pipeline.</p><p>The data within a <code>PCollection</code> can be of any arbitrary type, as long as the elements can be encoded as <code>string</code> for serializing them across the workers.</p><p><code>PCollections</code> can be of any size, but their elements might be worked on by different workers, if the collection is too large to fit into memory on a single worker node. Furthermore, they can be either <em>bounded</em> (i.e., have a fixed size) or <em>unbounded</em> (i.e., are “open ended”, like in a streaming scenario).</p><h3 id="transforms">Transforms</h3><p><code>Transforms</code> apply logic on individual elements of a <code>PCollection</code>, by <code>apply</code>ing user code and logic, and returning a full <code>PCollection</code> that can be used in a subsequent step.</p><p><img src="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/07/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-2-dataflow/images/design-your-pipeline-linear.svg" alt=""></p><p>It is also possible to <code>branch</code> a pipeline, by splitting the DAG into multiple, independent steps:
<img src="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/07/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-2-dataflow/images/design-your-pipeline-multiple-pcollections.svg" alt="">
(<a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#applying-transforms">https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#applying-transforms</a>)</p><p>Custom <code>transforms</code> need to adhere to some rules, most notably <strong>serializability</strong> (as data needs to be transmitted between workers), <strong>single threaded execution</strong> (as each element should be worked on, as orchestrated by the underlying Runner, in its own thread), and <strong>idempotence</strong> (as re-tries might occur).</p><p><code>Beam</code> provides several core <code>transforms</code> that can be utilized out-of-the-box:</p><ul><li><code>ParDo</code></li><li><code>GroupByKey</code></li><li><code>CoGroupByKey</code></li><li><code>Combine</code></li><li><code>Flatten</code></li><li><code>Partition</code></li></ul><h4 id="pardo">ParDo</h4><p>A <code>ParDo</code> transform is probably the most common one, as it is comparable to a <code>map</code> operation: Applying logic to each element of a <code>PCollection</code> and returning said element (or not returning it and hence, <code>filtering</code> the collection).</p><p>Thing of <code>ParDo</code> as your fundamental building blog of a job that applies logic on a flat stream of data, which can then be further enhanced by <code>grouping</code>, <code>flattening</code>, and other aggregation logic down the line.</p><p>To understand what a <code>ParDo</code> actually does, the <code>Beam</code> docs provide a great explanation of the lifecycle of a <code>ParDo</code>:</p><p><img src="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/07/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-2-dataflow/images/dofn-sequence-diagram.svg" alt=""></p><h4 id="cogroupbykey">CoGroupByKey</h4><p><code>CoGroupByKey</code> aggregates all input elements by their key over multiple input collections. CoGroupByKey performs a relational join of two or more key/value PCollections that have the same key type - a very useful thing we’ll be using in the example below.</p><h3 id="schemas">Schemas</h3><p>A <code>Schema</code> defines the logical structure and data types for the elements within a <code>PCollection</code>. <code>Beam Schemas</code>, similar to a <code>parquet</code> or <code>database</code> schema, should define <code>names</code>, <code>types</code>, and information on whether a field can be <code>NULL</code>.</p><p>Beam supports the following primitive types:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>BYTE</td><td>An 8-bit signed value</td></tr><tr><td>INT16</td><td>A 16-bit signed value</td></tr><tr><td>INT32</td><td>A 32-bit signed value</td></tr><tr><td>INT64</td><td>A 64-bit signed value</td></tr><tr><td>DECIMAL</td><td>An arbitrary-precision decimal type</td></tr><tr><td>FLOAT</td><td>A 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number</td></tr><tr><td>DOUBLE</td><td>A 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number</td></tr><tr><td>STRING</td><td>A string</td></tr><tr><td>DATETIME</td><td>A timestamp represented as milliseconds since the epoch</td></tr><tr><td>BOOLEAN</td><td>A boolean value</td></tr><tr><td>BYTES</td><td>A raw byte array</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="io">I/O</h3><p><code>I/O</code> is needed for providing input data and giving the pipeline one or multiple defined outputs. I will refer to <a href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/06/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-1/#io">Part 1</a> for a somewhat complete list of all <code>I/O</code> connectors by SDK.</p><p><code>I/O</code> connectors can also be customized, by inheriting from the existing Base classes to read non-supported file types. This can be challenging (as you want to be able to split a file source so it can be worked on by multiple workers), but after a while, becomes quite straightforward.</p><h3 id="runners">Runners</h3><p><code>Runners</code> define which system executes the pipeline, for instance by running locally (<code>DirectRunner</code>), on <code>Google Dataflow</code>, or via <code>Apache Spark</code>.</p><p>Similar to <code>I/O</code>, please refer to <a href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/06/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-1/#runners">Part 1</a> for an overview.</p><h2 id="the-use-case-for-a-sample-job">The Use Case for a Sample Job</h2><p>In order to demonstrate some of the fundamental differences, let’s define a sample use case that we can implement in both <code>Python</code> and <code>go</code>.</p><p>In this example, we follow this simple user story: “As a <em>movie enthusiast</em>, I want to <em>find movies that fit my preferences</em>, so that <em>I can watch a new movie”</em>.</p><p>Our <em>preferences</em> shall be:</p><ol><li>We want to parse both titles and ratings (<em>Reading data</em>)</li><li>We are only interested in movies, not TV shows; furthermore, movies should be made after 1970, to get some more reliable metadata to base our decision on, as older titles often only have basic information (<em>Filtering data</em>)</li><li>We want both basic title as well as rating information from different sources (<em>Combining data</em>)</li><li>We want the data in a useable format (<em>Writing data</em>) [0]</li></ol><p>For this, we’ll use the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">IMDb DataSet</a>, which can be utilized for non-commercial use and is refreshed daily.</p><p><em>The full source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/chollinger93/beam-examples">GitHub</a>.</em></p><p><em>[0] You might have gathered by now that these “preferences” are to demonstrate various <code>Beam</code> functionality - this is not a fancy recommendation engine and we don’t really care about the output</em></p><h3 id="drawing-the-design">Drawing the design</h3><p>As I’ve said in the introduction, we can start by designing our pipeline first and then cover the language-specific logic later.</p><p><img src="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/07/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-2-dataflow/images/movie_flow.svg" alt="Movie flow"></p><p>We have 2 main flows here, both of which do similar things: They read data, parse their format, and apply custom filters to the data. Next, they are being combined into one coherent set and written to one or multiple I/O targets.</p><p>Let’s so how to translate this into code.</p><h3 id="getting-data">Getting data</h3><p>If you agree with IMDb’s license, you can find the data <a href="https://datasets.imdbws.com/">here</a>.</p><p>We’ll start with the basic title data and make sure we start with a small test set, so we can develop locally without a cluster. In order to do that, we’ll grab random test data, as well as a movie we know fits our criteria, the 1971 classic “Vanishing Point”, with the id <code>tt0067927</code> (as it is unlikely we’ll find more matches between the 2 data sets we’ll be using otherwise, given the volume).</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1

<h2>The case for cheating</h2>
</p>
</header>
<p>I’m a high school student, and like most students I studied from home for the last 4-ish months. I study in my bedroom which is similar to my future workplace, or maybe it even is. My bedroom is equipped with a computer with an internet connection, same setup as my working parents. Since school is meant to prepare us for our careers, my bedroom seems to be the perfect place to pursue an education.</p>
<p>Not having strict supervision allows for easy cheating. No one will know if you use a dictionary. No one will know if you use a calculator. And no one will know if you collaborate with your peers. This got me thinking. If my bedroom <em>is</em> my workplace <em>and</em> I can cheat so easily, does this mean I get a free ride to being a billionaire?</p>
<p>I don’t believe that is the case. Why not? I have come to the conclusion that cheating at school is nothing like cheating in real life. In fact, this “cheating” thing is actually appreciated by employers. Employers don’t care if you use a calculator or dictionary. Using all available tools to the fullest extent is a positive skill. Furthermore, employers value employees who collaborate and discuss difficult problems with other people.</p>
<p>At school, however, you will likely be disqualified for doing any of those things during a test. Weird, since I’m at school to prepare for my life. And my life just happens to provide all of those tools<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="calculators-dictionaries-and-wikipedia">Calculators, dictionaries and Wikipedia</h2>
<p>Why do children spend countless hours doing basic arithmetic, when they will be using a calculator for all serious decisions after they graduate? Seriously, who is going to do taxes from the top of their head when they can easily use a calculator? I’m not advocating to stop teaching children math. On the contrary, I actually do think teaching students <em>why</em> addition exists, <em>what</em> it is and <em>when</em> they should use it are important topics that everyone should know. But I don’t care if they can add up 90234 and 87623 leaving a calculator (phone) in their pocket.</p>
<p>I’m also not advocating to stop teaching languages at school and relying on dictionaries instead. I wouldn’t have been able to write this text if I didn’t know English. But I also believe a dictionary helped me improve this text. It’s a combination of practice and resources that made this text what it is. I’m sure native speakers will find some mistakes, and I would love to know how to improve this text but at least we learned Shakespeare died in 1616.</p>
<p>Everyone has access to almost all of mankind’s knowledge regardless of where they are thanks to websites like Wikipedia. That’s a wonderful thing. This is no excuse, however, to stop education altogether; or humans would have been replaced already. Knowing how to apply something requires context, analytical skills and creativity, things a computer cannot yet do, but we can teach children.</p>
<h2 id="cheating-is-bad">Cheating is bad</h2>
<p>Many people say you only fool yourself by cheating. I agree. Cheating is bad if it will hurt you later on. I don’t believe collaborating will ever hurt me. Nor do I believe using a dictionary will.</p>
<p>“But knowing something is quicker than looking it up.” Absolutely! I wish I knew how to provide first aid in pressing situations. I wish I hadn’t wasted time learning to memorize facts I don’t use. And in the rare event of me needing to know who painted some piece, I have Wikipedia right in my pocket.</p>
<p>It’s not fair to cheat at an exam and earn a certificate tricking people into believing you can do something in isolation, when in fact you cannot. So will I study for that exam? Probably not, but I will make sure I can get things done.</p>
<h2 id="what-school-should-do">What school should do</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, exercises are that impossible to cheat at are, besides the fairest, possibly among the best exercises we can spend time on. Filling out a fancy survey, read exam, may be a way to validate the products in an assembly line, but one would be stupid to believe human qualities can be captured by a number. We shouldn’t test humans the same way we test tools. But most importantly, we are only teaching students facts we know today, and that does not seem to be particularly responsible in a world evolving this rapidly.</p>
<p>An alternative to exams could be asking students to devise something new. After all, how could one cheat at doing something that does not exist yet? Writing a philosophical essay, debating issues in society or writing computer programs seem good places to start. Students should be free to use the tools that are available to professionals in the field, work within common constraints such as deadlines, and above all, be able to collaborate. Using a smart rotation system it would still be possible to extract individual student performance from a shared environment.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Exercises I can cheat at are <em>exercises</em>, for what exactly? I think school should pose exercises I can’t cheat at. If cheating takes time that could be made as a constraint on the exercise. Looking up how to make an argument during a debate won’t sound very convincing. Math requires exact answers and computers often can’t manage that. Fair enough, we will have to do it by hand. There is nothing inherently bad about it.</p>
<p>If I can cheat at something and still get the correct answer or get a project done, I have found a loophole in education. It means education is not prepared for the technological advancements. School today doesn’t really prepare us for the future. Let’s change that.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> I'm not taking the great technology for granted, but I am planning on continuing to enjoy using it.

<![CDATA[Supercharge Your Bash History]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For some weird reason I’ve decided to abandon my insane ZShell
setup for a while and switch to a vanilla Bash. Guess I needed a bit of simplicity in my life.
One thing about my initial Bash experience that drove me nuts is the way it handles the
history out-of-the-box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each shell session has its own history and once you terminate a session it history
is dumped to <code>.bash_history</code>, overwriting whatever was there in the past. For me this pretty much kills the value of
persistent shell history. Note that if you
don’t exit cleanly your history will just be lost.</li>
  <li>As a corollary - you can’t really share history between different shell sessions. Each shell loads the history file on startup
and augments it whatever commands were executed in it, after loading the file. If you ran a build command in shell A you can’t
easily recall it in shell B.</li>
  <li>It keeps duplicated entries in the history.</li>
  <li>By default it doesn’t store many history entries (only the last 500 commands).</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there’s no right way to do shell history and what you consider right or optimal depends on how exactly are using your shell.
I know many people who hate sharing data between shell sessions, as they want to keep them isolated for various reason.</p>

<p>On the other hand - I don’t know a single person who likes their shell history to be constantly overwritten.
Let’s teach Bash to append to the history file instead
of overwriting it! Just add the following to your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># append to the history file, don't overwrite it</span>
<span>shopt</span> <span>-s</span> histappend
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that some Linux distros (e.g. Ubuntu) might be enabling this shell option
in the default <code>.bashrc</code> they copy to each user’s home folder.</p>

<p>Now, let’s increase the history size and teach Bash to ignore duplicate entries in the history:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.</span>
<span># See bash(1) for more options</span>
<span>HISTCONTROL</span><span>=</span>ignoreboth

<span># for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)</span>
<span>HISTSIZE</span><span>=</span>100000
<span>HISTFILESIZE</span><span>=</span>10000000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can obviously go really big here, but unless you have a very fast SSD I would not recommend
it, as reading the history can add a bit of latency to new shell sessions.</p>

<p>Now, we’re moving to the crux of it - let’s teach Bash to update the history after each
command we invoke and to reload it. The reloading is what ensures that different shell
sessions are synced in terms of history.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># append and reload the history after each command</span>
<span>PROMPT_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>"history -a; history -n"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>history -a</code> writes to the history file and <code>history -n</code> reloads the history from the file, but with a twist - it loads only the new entries that were added there. This makes it way more efficient
than another similar (and quite popular) approach - namely using <code>history -a; history -c; history -r</code>. Full
reloads of a huge history file would exhibit themselves as slight delays after each command you run. The solution I’ve
suggested should largely avoid them.</p>

<p>You might also want to remove the use of certain commands from your history, whether for privacy or readability reasons. This can be done with the <code>$HISTIGNORE</code> variable. It’s common to use this to exclude <code>ls</code> (and similar) calls, job control built-ins like <code>bg</code> and <code>fg</code>, and calls to <code>history</code> itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HISTIGNORE</span><span>=</span><span>'ls:ll:cd:pwd:bg:fg:history'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Feel free to add here any other commands that you don’t want to store in the history.
Note that here you’re specifying exact matches for exclusion - the above config would
exclude <code>ls</code>, but it won’t exclude <code>ls projects</code>. Most of the time you’d be using this
with commands invoked without arguments.</p>

<p>So, putting it all together, that’s my magic recipe to supercharge Bash’s history:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># place this in your .bashrc</span>

<span># don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.</span>
<span># See bash(1) for more options</span>
<span>HISTCONTROL</span><span>=</span>ignoreboth

<span># append to the history file, don't overwrite it</span>
<span>shopt</span> <span>-s</span> histappend
<span># append and reload the history after each command</span>
<span>PROMPT_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>"history -a; history -n"</span>

<span># ignore certain commands from the history</span>
<span>HISTIGNORE</span><span>=</span><span>"ls:ll:cd:pwd:bg:fg:history"</span>

<span># for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)</span>
<span>HISTSIZE</span><span>=</span>100000
<span>HISTFILESIZE</span><span>=</span>10000000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s all I have for you today! Keep hacking!</p>

<p>It was a frigid cold day in Des Moines on January 28, 2019.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Like most January days, I was just hoping to hold on a few more weeks until the early signs of Spring would start to thaw things out and give me that yearly boost of energy.</p>



<p>But, it turned out that I was going to get a different kind of jolt.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.hellosign.com/blog/a-letter-from-our-ceo-were-joining-dropbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm (opens in a new tab)">Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm</a>,” the headline read in my push notifications.<br></p>



<p>I stared at it for a long time.</p>



<p>A combination of shock and elation took hold as I bounded out of bed.<br></p>



<p>HelloSign and Optimist had been working together for nearly two years at this point. But I had no idea that the acquisition was in play. The whole deal has been basically kept under wraps. Most of the team only found out about it right before it was finalized.<br></p>



<p>It was a momentous achievement for their team.<br></p>



<p>When we first started working with HelloSign, they had just raised their Series A and were on a path to rapidly expand their eSignature solution, roll out HelloWorks, and move upmarket with HelloSign integrations and API.<br></p>



<p>There was a lot to do and a lot of content and strategy to figure out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>We had our work cut out for us.</em><br></p>



<p>Luckily, our team and the HelloSign team are both full of outrageously smart people. We dug in and put together a strategy.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IcibgJc6j5tpYXEm_m_ik9W_YNLIIrvzZmHTBHmriqbihYkO2NXDz9SogzmE-H203ML1Ju0uP7cRPqUx1tfIZVWA1m96_8xdxPLSvlIP7m05Ej7q9o3kuaEoE_oESJVNPETObhOq" alt="HelloSign's Organic Traffic Growth (October 2017 to January 2019)"></figure>



<p>Over the previous 17 months (and to this day), we worked closely with the HelloSign team to drive 1,308% growth in targeted organic traffic. This growth correlated almost perfectly with the growth of their business and the acquisition that took place in January.<br></p>



<p>Through this process and in working with many other SaaS companies over the years, we have developed and refined some key strategies and tactics that we use to drive growth for all of our clients and other SaaS businesses in particular.<br></p>



<p>From that, we’ve distilled those strategies into a core framework that defines how we achieve specific results and reach key goals.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This article is about that framework.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing for SaaS: Driving User Signups</h2>



<p>Nearly all SaaS companies have pretty straightforward goals for their content marketing:<br></p>



<ol><li>Drive product sign-ups and trials</li><li>Everything else. (Traffic, brand awareness,&nbsp;leads, emails, etc)</li></ol>



<p>HelloSign is no different.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although they have a number of market focuses and products that were in play, the ultimate business objective of our work together was–unsurprisingly–to grow users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, that’s what we set out to do.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The question, of course, is how you use content as a lever for both capturing the right audience, convincing them of the value of the product, and ultimately converting them into customers.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NE0svR6j4qHgtXc2V0wxw-XR_jXTW2e6L1PcoXncPqUFLJJf-5yorAWPbmSo7GTA0rQ1AVPBM5L13O3khI7G6SyuyCWMJdKTaxAHrwyqa1jQ8A24fTUK7JHuZ6iz4crHUrOTLlkI" alt=""></figure>



<p>In most instances, these goals feel at odds with one another. The content that is most valuable to you as a business (most product-focused) is often less valuable to a reader who is trying to learn about a topic or solve a problem broadly.<br></p>



<p>As with most content marketing frameworks, we find that the key is to unpack the specific moving parts and build a strategy that addresses each specific goal as part of a broader strategy.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In other words, break it down and solve for each piece independently. Then pull everything together into a cohesive framework.</p>



<h2>The SaaS Content Funnel Paradox</h2>



<p>Most SaaS product signups (trials, leads, etc) come from the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p>In other words, a prospect has researched their problem, discovered a general solution, and they begin researching products that offer it. In most cases, few prospects read content that’s at the top of the funnel and immediately hop into a product–it’s rare.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means that in order for a SaaS content marketing strategy to be successful, you need to put a lot of emphasis on driving solution-aware traffic to content and pages that are in the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p><em>But there’s a challenge</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages on your site that are most relevant to a middle-of-the-funnel searcher are your core product pages–features, integrations, solutions, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>These are notoriously difficult pages to rank (especially in a crowded market like esignatures) because there are very few ways for them to naturally accrue links or promote such product-focused content directly to a prospect.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png" alt="HelloSign's Product Marketing site is full of targeted landing pages" srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>This creates a paradox.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages that you care most about ranking and generating traffic to are also, often, the most difficult to rank and drive traffic to.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, how do you overcome this obstacle, resolve the paradox, and restore order to the universe? (Okay, maybe just that first part.)<br></p>



<p>The solution is to <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/frameworks">create a framework</a> that leverages <em>top of the funnel content</em> as a means to generate not just traffic, but also links (domain and topical authority) that helps these important pages rank over time.<br></p>



<p>This has become the basis for our work with most SaaS clients.</p>



<h2>The Optimist SaaS Content Marketing Framework</h2>



<p>Before we get into the specifics of how we executed this strategy, I want to reveal the framework that we use to shape our thinking and our approach.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This framework builds on our trifecta strategy that we originally developed from my work scaling College Raptor from <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/content-marketing-seo-case-study-the-trifecta-strategy/">0 to 100,000 organic searches/mo</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>But, given the specific nuances of the SaaS business model and the extended B2B buyer’s journey, it’s not a simple cut-and-paste process.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JdENWX5eN_LOMVx2I778zGXks82Eu5MkC92ktCgboJrcur7JAo8f4fL_h--FFGUsYwsffYMq9_RderLzTycXIEcGwE4gZKm9WyTrHe2w27jUojSYaRNlB8-e_WwMoQj5rkKBiHG0" alt=""></figure>



<p>The framework that we developed integrates key insights about how buyers interact with SaaS businesses and which strategies are most effective for driving actual conversions.<br></p>



<p>For our work with HelloSign, we applied a framework similar to this. Ultimately, we’ve found that most SaaS businesses have similar goals and thus, the overall approach to content marketing is a variation of this general framework.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s not one-size-fits-all, but it’s about as close as you can get when you’re talking about true strategy.<br></p>



<p>Let’s step through all of the types of content that were part of HelloSign’s massive growth.</p>



<h2>Pre-Funnel Content: Targeting the Right Buyers</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the actual funnel and the buyer’s journey, I want to begin with what we call pre-funnel or persona-qualified content.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although it’s often at least one step removed from a buying cycle, pre-funnel content can serve an important supporting role in a SaaS content marketing strategy. The idea here is to create content that attracts your target buyer <em>broadly</em>, even if they aren’t problem-aware.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png" alt="Thought leadership content attracts relevant buyers, even if they are pre-funnel." srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>Case in point: HelloSign speaks a lot to sales leaders in their content. We created a lot of content that was aimed at generally helping this persona do their job better, even if that didn’t involve using HelloSign’s products to do it.<br></p>



<p>This allows us to accomplish a number of things:&nbsp;<br></p>



<ol><li>Expand search/social footprint</li><li>Build brand awareness and familiarity with our target personas</li><li>Drive retargeting and email marketing</li></ol>



<p>But, keep in mind that this content, while valuable if used strategically, can also be a distraction from the key objective. It rarely leads to a product conversion.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Don’t let it become the center of your approach unless you have already built out every other part of the funnel in full.</p>



<h2>Top of the Funnel Content: Helping Prospects Solve Problems</h2>



<p>The top of the funnel is often misunderstood in the world of content marketing generally and SaaS, especially.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Our take is simple: <em>The top of the funnel starts when a buyer begins to actively learn about or seek a solution to problem that could lead to a purchase.</em><br></p>



<p>In the world of HelloSign, we see this as the pain point that the user is looking to solve that <em>could </em>ultimately lead to a product conversion.<br></p>



<p>If the buyer is a VP of Sales or Sales Operations Director, then they may begin their journey by looking to accelerate their sales cycle–cut down the days between contract and close.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>One solution to this problem is to implement esignatures.</em><br></p>



<p>So, from a content perspective, we target this initial need as an opportunity to capture the buyer at the point where they are looking for solutions to a problem. In my <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/saas-seo-strategy/">post about SaaS SEO</a>, I talked about our process of using a JTBD framework to identify and map these specific pain points to key product use cases and features.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Within the top of the funnel content, we break down our content strategy into <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/100k">3 key types of content that each serve a specific purpose</a>. I’ve outlined this approach before, but it allows us to get very specific and tactical while staying strategic in our content planning and creation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Social-viral content (Thought leadership)</h3>



<p>For HelloSign, what we pursue as social-viral content is strong thought leadership content that’s likely to generate a lot of shares and buzz around a particular topic.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>What we have found is that the more of a strong stance we are willing to take topics related to work, culture, and operations, the more reaction we generate among our target readers. Of course, this approach can be polarizing as well.<br></p>



<p>The key to our approach here is to be thoughtful about where we plant a flag.<br></p>



<p>Knowing that readers who align with specific thinking are most likely to become users and customers, we can draw a line in the sand to help attract like-minded buyers who feel strongly about the nature of work and productivity.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the search (SEO) opportunity for this content may not be enormous.<br></p>



<p>That’s okay.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The role of this content is to reach prospects through channels other than search; social and community channels. We want to generate a buzz and demand based on the content and drive problem awareness. That means that this topics often have a short shelf life.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>They’re perennial rather than evergreen. We can circle back to them every few months or every year and use them to drive traffic through key channels.</p>



<h3>2. Evergreen content</h3>



<p>The meat and potatoes of our SaaS content marketing framework–the workhorse–is evergreen content.<br></p>

        <p>As a software architect, it’s easy to get lost in technicalities, design patterns and implementation details. This often leads to your vision of the whole being blurred and obfuscated by building blocks that don’t really correlate with the system you are trying to design. Understanding that the whole is other than the sum of its parts, as Kurt Koffka once said, deeply affects our perception of the function imposed on those parts. If the whole is independent and has its own meaning, then what is the purpose of each one of those parts? None. They are meaningless, merely means to an end.</p>

<p>You can see where i’m going with this: a Factory, a Builder, a Strategy, they are nothing without the whole. And the whole has a purpose of its own, tied to the domain of our solution. Therefore, the purpose of the whole should never be tied to the intricacies of its parts. In <a href="http://a.co/7xaidXJ">Domain-Driven Design</a>, Eric Evans introduces the term <em>ubiquitous language</em>, which is a common language between developers and users of a software, tied to its domain model. In order to achieve a good architecture, your whole should be able to communicate it’s meaning using this same language. And so does the parts.</p>

<p>In the early 1910s, Kurt Koffka worked with Wolfgang Köhler and Max Wertheimer on several theories that formed the Gestalt psychology, which attempts to understand how humans visually perceive the world surrounding them and describes how they tend to organize visual elements into wholes. When learning the psychology of design and essential concepts such as space, balance and visual hierarchy, i also learned the principles of Gestalt. Rudolf Arnheim, in <a href="http://a.co/7Tg0pOz">his excellent book</a>, explains in great detail the principles of similarity, proximity, continuity, closure and ground symmetry.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you to take some time and read more about design psychology and, specifically, Arnheim’s book. But for now, i want to focus on the principle of similarity:</p>

<p><img src="http://klaussilveira.com/assets/gestalt.jpg" alt="Similarity"></p>

<p>You see the triangle. But the triangle does not exist, only three pacman-like structures. The structures are meaningless, but what they compose has an enormous complexity of its own. And this is what makes great software architecture: a software application is not just the sum of each of it’s components, it’s something else, independent, with a purpose of it’s own. And it is your responsibility, as a software architect, to find this purpose.</p>

<p>This is what i call unified perceptual modeling: bound by the rules of the language of your domain, you must model your application using several components, yet always through the perspective of the whole. If you don’t see the whole and its purpose, you will never achieve consistency.</p>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture. And philosophical liberals—those of us who believe in a pluralistic society that encourages ideological diversity—have the most principled reason to get on board.</p><p>Hatred of any form of wrong think now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9790764/partisan-discrimination">threatens the foundations</a> of our social fabric. Since the stakes of public policy debates are high, it is understandable—and even admirable—for citizens to subject each other’s views to vigorous criticism. But, if ordinary people fear that a minor misunderstanding or a deeply held difference of opinion might cost them their jobs, freedom of speech—the cornerstone of any liberal order—is under serious threat. </p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>
<p><em><b>Criteria:</b> The core use case of interoperability is not a specific application, but rather a concept: Connectivity. The primary value of interoperability (connectivity) comes down to the basic need for wide inclusivity – enabling the widest range of networks to connect whilst reducing the impediments to the path of connection.Given the primary value is satisfied, developers and end users may look at these solutions through the lens of trustlessness, performance, decentralisation etc. as secondary values to evaluate tools. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A close look at the DLT space reveals a series of public and private chains that operate largely in distinct silos. As DLTs accelerate towards maturity a key infrastructure requirement will be the ability for information to be transmitted in real time from chain to chain and even off-chain to old world systems.</p>
<p>However the question of why we need interoperability is sometimes complicated by developers and users thinking of very specific use cases- a complex array of applications and niche features. This mindset needs to be geared towards something far more simple, going down to the very basics of interoperability.</p>
<p>CONNECTIVITY</p>
<p>This glaringly obvious but often overlooked use case of interoperability is a concept without which DLTs will continue to function in silos but never capitalise on their full potential. Take for example, any decentralised application or network and ask if that by enabling connectivity, would it suffer or thrive?</p>
<p>If the internet has taught us anything, it is the true value and weight of change that connectivity has brought to the world. Connectivity itself is therefore the use case of interoperability, and to underestimate the value that this simple concept brings would be negligent.</p>
<p>If we assume interoperability technology is perfected and that comprehensive connectivity is available, perhaps the issue or disconnect for many lie in the tribalism forming around DLTs such as BTC, ETH, NEO, EOS etc. To bring things into perspective, it’s akin to saying Country A should remain isolated from Country B. However this mindset will restrict DLTs from even competing with existing world systems to which connectivity is inextricably linked.</p>
<p>This article will therefore not focus on the specific use cases as popularly imagined by most, a Decentralized Exchange being perhaps the most popular. Instead we will imagine a world in which connectivity plays a significant role in a global decentralised economy. The challenge now faced by interoperability technologies is their ability to effectively optimise for connectivity without compromising the other core tenets of DLTs – specifically the trustless nature of decentralisation.</p>
<h3>The Varying Degrees of Decentralised Interoperability</h3>
<p>Connectivity to certain degrees is already apparent in the current landscape. Take for example the service Changelly or a centralised exchange like Binance, they act as a medium to allow exchange of one token for another. These mediums however do not align with the tenets that the underlying traded assets were built upon, a decentralised network that does not require the trust of a centralised third party.</p>
<p>As such the response within the space has been to develop technologies focusing on interoperability that do align with the core decentralisation tenets of Blockchain. The main technologies can be summarized as:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Notary Schemes</span></li>
<li><span>Relaychain and Parachains</span></li>
<li><span>Cross-Chain Hash Locking</span></li>
<li><span>Multichain Weaving</span></li>
</ol>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>What is important to draw from the above technologies is the ability to identify the varying degrees to which these technologies have achieve decentralised interoperability – the extent of connectivity established while maintaining decentralisation. </span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately users have the choice of any number of interoperable methods, even centralised exchanges. </span><span>To assist in this choice, consider the problems these technologies solve in regards to relationship of trust (blockchain tenets), security and access (connectivity). The problems manifest themselves as three core problems, in summary below and discussed in detail further down: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Opportunities/limitations of interoperability – Trust and security based on knowing full state vs verifying state</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Value transfer</span>
<ul>
<li>Full state of member chains as part of the protocol’s data</li>
<li>Compatible chain communications (Hashlocking)</li>
<li>Verifying the state based on verification by a validator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Access to Data – Knowing the states of member chains – i.e. Proving data relative to another network, effectively allowing smart contracts and applications to leverage this “knowing”.&nbsp;Can be achieved via:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Full state of member chains as part of the protocol’s data</span></li>
<li><span>Verifying the state based on verification by a validator</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Methods of interoperability – Trust based on validators vs no validators</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Centralised hubs </span></li>
<li><span>Validator based (Verification via Validators, 3rd party)</span></li>
<li><span>Work based (Verification does not require validators)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Access to interoperability – conditions to participate</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Conditional requirement to participate – i.e. requires smart contract or requires change to core protocol</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>The first problem: </b><span>Opportunities / limitations of interoperability – &nbsp;Trust and security based on knowing full state vs verifying state</span></p>
<p><span>The variable here is trust based. The two options being “knowing” of states vs verification of a state. Multichain technology can “know” full states as all member chains are part of the parent chain, allowing constant knowing of the latest states of said member chains. Where on the other hand variations of the notary scheme require verification of the latest state by validators. To put it simply, the difference lies in that notary schemes have to confirm information external to their protocol, where multichains are in a constant state of knowing ergo internal confirmation. </span></p>
<p><span>If we are to look at this in regard to security, if the members chains’ data is part of the core protocol (as proposed by Polkadot and Block Collider – multichain technology) the states of those chains is secured by the entire protocol and therefore verification and use of that data is as secure as the protocol. As popularly proposed, notary schemes, that verify states based on interoperable actions triggered, are separate chains or nodes bridging information between chains to the core protocol. The security then of the bridges is independent of the core protocol making it more vulnerable to attacks. A slight exception lies with projects like ARK, where the whole protocol acts as one cohesive notary scheme for all member chains, where the bridges are not separate chains or clusters of nodes. By doing so the resources utilised are not split to many disparate smaller bridges, ensuring more security overall. </span></p>
<p><b>The second problem:</b><span> Methods of interoperability – Trust based on validators vs no validators</span></p>
<p>To understand this problem we must first understand the core tenets of which blockchain technology was built upon and what it ultimately means to the end user. The tenets or pillars can be thought of as four topics:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Objective networks</span></li>
<li><span>Unforgeable costliness </span></li>
<li><span>True Trustless Networks</span></li>
<li><span>True permissionless networks</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>For a more comprehensive breakdown of these topics that act as the pillars of Decentralised Protocols please read <a href="https://spec-rationality.com/scalability-overview/#merits_of_pow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>“The most valued merit of the trustless model is its ability to preserve the network’s independence from any entity acting as a trusted third party (government, bank or otherwise) with the power to tamper with, control or censor any element of the network.</span></p>
<p><span>It is this distinguishing feature of PoW, that enables it to offer a level of trustlessness beyond other consensus mechanisms which rely on the use of validators. A validator in a blockchain is a “human element” or third party to whom the network cedes some degree of trust to confirm the verification of transactions. “… To understand the spectrum of trustlessnes, one can imagine that centralised systems which completely relinquish trust to a third party are on one end and variations of PoW that eliminate trust are on the other. The various validator reliant consensus mechanisms lie in the middle, redistributing rather than eliminating trust.” </span></p>
<p><span>As alluded to above, trust minimization is a crucial element of blockchain technology, where PoW variations (work based schemes) like the multichain proposed by Block Collider (PoD) attempt to preserve the network as trustless. Further mining (wok based) schemes preserve objectivity and unforegable costliness, something that is compromised when we move towards validator based consensus.</span></p>
<p><span>Notary schemes by design have the underlying consensus as validator based (refer to <a href="https://spec-rationality.com/methods-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Methods of Interoperability</a>). Multichains need not only be work based either, for example Polkadot has taken the route of multichains with a validator based consensus. (Note: Polkadot only creates the multichain between compatible parachains) </span></p>
<p><b>The third problem:</b><span> Access to interoperability – &nbsp;conditions to participate</span></p>
<p><span>Access can be defined by the ability for a interoperable technology to incorporate chains with as low an entry threshold as possible. Access can viewed than as a spectrum that is defined by the conditional requirement to participate.</span></p>
<p><span>The ideal is that if a new protocol/chain were to come into existence that it is able to join an …</span></p></div></div></section></div>

The ones that have stood the test of time <span>(</span>PyTorch<span>,</span> Tensorflow<span>,</span> ONNX<span>,</span> etc<span>)</span> are backed by _massive_ corporations<span>,</span> <span>and</span> likely aren't going away anytime soon<span>.</span> 

This also presents a problem<span>,</span> however<span>,</span> <span>as</span> the deep learning community has diverged <span>from</span> popular traditional ML software libraries like scikit<span>-</span>learn<span>,</span> XGBoost<span>,</span> <span>and</span> LightGBM<span>.</span> 
When it comes time <span>for</span> companies to bring multiple models <span>with</span> different software <span>and</span> hardware assumptions into production<span>,</span> things get<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>hairy<span>.</span> 
<span>-</span> How do you keep ML inference code <span>[</span>DRY<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>en<span>.</span>wikipedia<span>.</span>org<span>/</span>wiki<span>/</span>Don<span>%</span>27t_repeat_yourself<span>)</span> when some models are tensor<span>-</span>based <span>and</span> others are vector<span>-</span>based?
<span>-</span> How do you keep the inference runtime efficiency of your traditional models competitive<span>,</span> <span>as</span> GPU<span>-</span>based neural networks start to run circles around them?
</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>
I know<span>,</span> I know<span>.</span> Using microservices <span>in</span> Kubernetes can solve the design pattern issue to an extent by keeping things de<span>-</span>coupled<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>if</span> that's even what you want?

But<span>,</span> I think that really just ignores the problem<span>.</span> What <span>if</span> you want to seamlessly deploy either an XGBoost regressor <span>or</span> fully<span>-</span>connected DNN <span>as</span> your service's main output? 
Sure<span>,</span> you could hot<span>-</span>swap the hardware your service launches onto<span>.</span> How about the code? 

Are you going to ram <span>in</span> a dressed<span>-</span>up version of an <span>if</span><span>-</span><span>else</span> switch to use one software framework vs the other<span>,</span> depending on the model <span>type</span>? 
</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>
Well<span>,</span> <span>for</span> a lot of use cases<span>,</span> _it is_<span>.</span> 
However<span>,</span> there's still a huge gap between problems requiring neural nets <span>and</span> problems that can be sufficiently solved <span>with</span> more traditional models<span>.</span> 
For the more traditional models<span>,</span> don<span>'t you still want to be able to use the latest and greatest computational frameworks to power your model'</span>s predictions? 
This would allow you to scale your model _up_ more before you need to resort to scaling it _out_ via redundant instances<span>.</span>

</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Microsoft research has introduced `hummingbird` to bridge this gap between CPU<span>-</span>oriented models <span>and</span> tensor<span>-</span>oriented models<span>.</span> 
The library simply takes <span>any</span> of our already<span>-</span>trained traditional models <span>and</span> returns a version of that model built on tensor computations<span>.</span> 
Hummingbird aims to solve two core concerns <span>with</span> current ML applications<span>:</span>

<span>1</span><span>.</span> Traditional <span>and</span> deep learning software libraries have different abstractions of their basic computational unit <span>(</span>vector vs tensor<span>)</span><span>.</span>
<span>2</span><span>.</span> As a result of this difference<span>,</span> traditional ML libraries do <span>not</span> receive the same performance gains <span>as</span> hardware accelerators <span>(</span>read<span>:</span> GPUs<span>)</span> improve<span>.</span>
</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>With Hummingbird<span>,</span> your ML pipelines will start to look cleaner<span>.</span> 
You'll know that<span>,</span> regardless of algorithm<span>,</span> you end up <span>with</span> a model that creates its predictions via tensor computations<span>.</span> 
Not only that<span>,</span> these tensor computations will be run by the same deep learning framework of choice that your organization has likely already given allegiance to<span>.</span> 

All of this <span>from</span> one function call<span>.</span> Not a bad deal <span>in</span> my book!

Well<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>that was unexpected<span>.</span> There's no two ways about this one<span>:</span> Hummingbird might run slower on CPU <span>for</span> certain data sets<span>.</span>
This can even be seen by some of their current example notebooks <span>in</span> the Hummingbird <span>[</span>Github repo<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>github<span>.</span>com<span>/</span>microsoft<span>/</span>hummingbird<span>)</span><span>.</span>

That being said<span>,</span>this side effect shouldn<span>'t have anyone running for the door -- remember the library'</span>s goal! 
The main reason <span>for</span> converting a model to tensor computations <span>is</span> to leverage hardware that _excels_ <span>in</span> that area<span>.</span> 

Spoiler alert<span>:</span> I'm talking about GPUs!

<p>Back in February 2020, Blelloch and Wei submitted this cool preprint: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07053">Concurrent Reference Counting and Resource Management in Wait-free Constant Time</a>.
Their work mostly caught my attention because they propose a wait-free implementation of hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation.<sup id="fnref:but-also"><a href="#fn:but-also">1</a></sup>
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tomhart/papers/tomhart_thesis.pdf">Safe memory reclamation (PDF)</a> is a key component in lock-free algorithms when garbage collection isn’t an option,<sup id="fnref:it-is-gc"><a href="#fn:it-is-gc">2</a></sup>
and <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.378&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">hazard pointers (PDF)</a> let us bound the amount of resources stranded by delayed cleanups much more tightly than, e.g., <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-579.pdf">epoch reclamation (PDF)</a>.
However the usual implementation has a <em>loop</em> in its <a href="https://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-algorithms.html">read barriers (in the garbage collection sense)</a>,
which can be annoying for code generation and bad for worst-case time bounds.</p>
<p>Blelloch and Wei’s wait-free algorithm eliminates that loop… with a construction that stacks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09671">two emulated primitives—atomic copy, itself implemented with strong LL/SC—</a>on top of what real hardware offers.
I see the real value of the construction in proving that wait-freedom is achievable,<sup id="fnref:not-obvious"><a href="#fn:not-obvious">3</a></sup>
and that the key is atomic memory-memory copies.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll show how to flatten down that abstraction tower into something practical with a bit of engineering elbow grease,
and come up with wait-free alternatives to the usual lock-free hazard pointers
that are competitive in the best case.
Blelloch and Wei’s insight that hazard pointers can use any wait-free atomic memory-memory copy lets us improve the worst case
without impacting the common case!</p>
<p>But first, what are hazard pointers?</p>
<h2 id="hazard-pointers-and-the-safe-memory-reclamation-problem">Hazard pointers and the safe memory reclamation problem</h2>
<p>Hazard pointers were introduced by <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/m/Michael:Maged_M=.html">Maged Michael</a>
in <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.378&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Hazard Pointers: Safe Memory Reclamation for Lock-Free Objects (2005, PDF)</a>,
as the first solution to reclamation races in lock-free code.
The introduction includes a concise explanation of the safe memory reclamation (SMR) problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a thread removes a node, it is possible that some other contending thread—in the course of its lock-free operation—has earlier read a reference to that node, and is about to access its contents. If the removing thread were to reclaim the removed node for arbitrary reuse, the contending thread might corrupt the object or some other object that happens to occupy the space of the freed node, return the wrong result, or suffer an access error by dereferencing an invalid pointer value. […] Simply put, the memory reclamation problem is how to allow the memory of removed nodes to be freed (i.e., reused arbitrarily or returned to the OS), while guaranteeing that no thread accesses free memory, and how to do so in a lock-free manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, a solution to the SMR problem lets us know when it’s safe to
<em>physically release</em> resources that used to be owned by a linked data structure,
once all links to these resources have been removed from that data structure (after “logical deletion”).
The problem makes intuitive sense for dynamically managed memory,
but it applies equally well to any resource (e.g., file descriptors),
and its solutions can even be seen as extremely read-optimised reader/writer locks.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind Hazard Pointers is to have
each thread publish to permanently allocated<sup id="fnref:stable-alloc"><a href="#fn:stable-alloc">4</a></sup> hazard pointer records (HP records) the set of resources (pointers) it’s temporarily borrowing from a lock-free data structure.
That’s enough information for a background thread to snapshot the current list of resources that have been logically deleted but not yet physically released (the limbo list),
scan all records for all threads,
and physically release all resources in the snapshot that aren’t in any HP record.</p>
<p>With just enough batching of the limbo list, this scheme can be practical:
in practice, lock-free algorithms only need to pin a few (usually one or two) nodes at a time to ensure memory safety. As long as we avoid running arbitrary code while holding hazardous references, we can bound the number of records each thread may need at any one time.
Scanning the records thus takes time roughly linear in the number of active threads, and we can amortise that to constant time per deleted item by waiting until the size of the limbo list is greater than a multiple of the number of active threads.<sup id="fnref:even-with-pinned-nodes"><a href="#fn:even-with-pinned-nodes">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The tricky bit is figuring out how to reliably publish to a HP record without locking.
Hazard pointers simplify that challenge with three observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s OK to have arbitrary garbage in a record (let’s disregard language-level<sup id="fnref:or-hw-level"><a href="#fn:or-hw-level">6</a></sup> undefined behaviour), since protected values are only ever subtracted from the limbo list: a garbage record simply doesn’t protect anything.</li>
<li>It’s also OK to leave a false positive in a record: correctness arguments for hazard pointers already assume each record keeps a different node (resource) alive, and that’s the worst case.</li>
<li>1 and 2 mean it doesn’t matter what pinned value we read in a record whose last update was started after we snapshotted the limbo list: resources in the limbo list are unreachable, so freshly pinned resources can’t refer to anything in the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where the clever bit of hazard pointers comes in:
we must make sure that any resource (pointer to a node, etc.) we borrow from a lock-free data structure is immediately protected by a HP record.
We can’t make two things happen atomically without locking.
Instead, we’ll <em>guess</em><sup id="fnref:guessing-is-fine"><a href="#fn:guessing-is-fine">7</a></sup> what resource we will borrow,
publish that guess,
and then actually borrow the resource.
If we guessed correctly, we can immediately use the borrowed resource;
if we were wrong, we must try again.</p>
<p>On an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_consistency">sequentially consistent</a> machine,
the pseudocode looks like the following. The <code>cell</code> argument points to the resource we wish to acquire
(e.g., it’s a reference to the <code>next</code> field in a linked list node), and <code>record</code> is the hazard pointer
record that will protect the value borrowed from <code>cell</code>.</p>

<p>We need a store/load fence in <code>R1</code> to make sure the store to the record (just above <code>R1</code>) is visible by the time the second read (<code>R2</code>) executes.

this fence is the only one that isn’t implicitly satisfied by the hardware.
It also happens that fences are best implemented with atomic operations
on x86oids,
so we can eliminate the fence in <code>R1</code>
by replacing the store just before <code>R1</code> with an atomic exchange (fetch-and-set).</p>
<p>The slow cleanup path has its own fence that matches <code>R1</code> (the one in <code>R2</code>

<p>We must make sure all the values in the limbo list we grab in <code>C1</code>
were added to the list (and thus logically deleted) before we read any
of the records in <code>C2</code>, with the acquire read in <code>C1</code>
matching the store-load fence in <code>R1</code>.</p>
<p>The following sequence diagrams shows how the fencing guarantees that any
iteration of <code>hp_read_explicit</code> will fail if it starts before <code>C1</code>
and observes a stale value.
If the read succeeds, the ordering between <code>R1</code> and <code>C1</code> instead
guarantees that the cleanup loop will observed the pinned value
when it reads the record in <code>C2</code>.</p>

<p>This all works, but it’s slow:<sup id="fnref:travis-says-its-fine"><a href="#fn:travis-says-its-fine">9</a></sup> we added an <em>atomic</em> write instruction (or worse, a fence) to a read-only operation. We can do better with a little help from our operating system.</p>
<h2 id="injecting-fences-with-os-support">Injecting fences with OS support</h2>
<p>When we use fences or memory ordering correctly, there should be
an implicit pairing between fences or ordered operations: we use fencing to
enforce an ordering (one must fully execute before or after another,
overlap is forbidden) between pairs of instructions in different
threads. For example, the pseudocode for hazard pointers with
explicit fencing and memory ordering paired the store-load fence in
<code>R1</code> with the acquisition of the limbo list in <code>C1</code>.</p>
<p>We only need that pairing very rarely, when a thread actually executes the
cleanup function. The amortisation strategy guarantees we don’t scan records all the time, and we can always increase the amortisation factor if we’re
generating tiny amounts of garbage very quickly.</p>
<p>It kind of sucks that we have to incur a full fence on the fast read
path, when it only matches reads in the cleanup loop maybe as rarely
as, e.g., once a second. If we waited long enough on the slow path, we could
<a href="https://pvk.ca/Blog/2019/01/09/preemption-is-gc-for-memory-reordering">rely on events like preemption or other interrupts to insert a barrier</a>
in all threads that are executing the read-side.</p>
<p>How long is “enough?”
Linux has the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html"><code>membarrier</code> syscall</a>
to block the calling thread until (more than) long enough has elapsed,
Windows has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushprocesswritebuffers">the similar <code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code></a>, and
on other operating systems, we can probably <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/barrierd">do something useful with scheduler statistics</a> or ask for a new syscall.</p>
<p>Armed with these new blocking system calls, we can replace the store-load fence in <code>R1</code> with a compiler barrier, and execute a slow <code>membarrier</code>/<code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code> after <code>C1</code>.
The cleanup function will then wait long enough<sup id="fnref:arguably-lock-ful"><a href="#fn:arguably-lock-ful">10</a></sup> to ensure that any

  <p><span>07 Jul 2020</span></p>
  <p>In 2017, the twilight days of my PhD in computational physics, I found myself ready to leave academia behind.
While my research was interesting, it was not what I wanted to pursue full time.
However, I was happy with the type of work I was doing, contributing to research software, and I wanted to apply myself in a more industrial setting.</p>

<p>Many postgraduates face a similar decision.
A <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2010/4294970126.pdf">study conducted by the Royal Society</a> in 2010 reported that only 3.5% of PhD graduates end up in permanent research positions in academia.
Leaving aside the roots of the <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/">brain drain</a> on Universities, it is a compelling statistic that the <em>vast</em> majority of post-graduates end up leaving academia for industry at some point in their career.
It comes as no surprise that there are a growing number of bootcamps like <a href="https://www.s2ds.org/index.html">S2DS</a>, <a href="https://faculty.ai/">faculty.ai</a>, and <a href="https://insightfellows.com/data-science">Insight</a> that have sprung up in response to this trend, for machine learning and data science especially.
There are also no shortage of helpful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17944306">forum discussions</a> and <a href="https://pascalbugnion.net/blog/from-academia-to-data-science.html">blog posts</a> outlining what you should do in order to “break into the industry”, as well as many that relate the personal experiences of those who ultimately made the switch.</p>

<p>While the advice that follows in this blog post is directed at those looking to change careers, it would equally benefit those who opt to remain in the academic track.
Since the environment and incentives around building academic research software are very different to those of industry, the workflows around the former are, in general, not guided by the same engineering practices that are valued in the latter.</p>

<p>That is to say: <em>there is a difference between what is important in writing software for research, and for a user-focused, software product</em>.
Academic research software prioritises scientific correctness and flexibility to experiment above all else in pursuit of the researchers’ end product: published papers.
Industry software, on the other hand, prioritises maintainability, robustness, and testing as the software (generally speaking) <em>is</em> the product.</p>

<p>However, the two tracks share many common goals as well, such as catering to “users”, emphasising performance and <a href="https://codecheck.org.uk/">reproducibility</a>, but most importantly both ventures are <em>collaborative</em>.
Arguably then, both sets of principles are needed to write and maintain high-quality research software.
Incidentally, the <a href="https://society-rse.org/about/">Research Software Engineering</a> group at Invenia is uniquely tasked with incorporating all these incentives into the development of our research packages in order to get the best of both worlds.
But I digress.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-i-knew-in-my-phd">What I wish I knew in my PhD</h2>
<p>Most postgrads are self-taught programmers and learn from the same resources as their peers and collaborators, which are ostensibly adequate for academia.
Many also tend to work in isolation on their part of the code base and don’t require merging with other contributors’ work very frequently.
In industry, however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a> underpins many development workflows. 
Under a continuous delivery cycle, a developer benefits from the prompt feedback and cooperation of a full team of professional engineers and can, therefore, learn to implement engineering best practices more efficiently.</p>

<p>As such, it feels like a missed opportunity for universities not to promote good engineering practices more and teach them to their students.
Not least because having stable and maintainable tools are, in a sense, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#Digital_commons">“public goods”</a> in academia as much as industry.
Yet, while everyone gains from improving the tools, researchers are not generally incentivised to invest their precious time or effort on these tasks unless it is part of some well-funded, high-impact initiative.
As Jake VanderPlas <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/">remarked</a>: “any time spent building and documenting software tools is time spent not writing research papers, which are the primary currency of the academic reward structure”.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, I learned a great deal about conducting research and scientific computing in my PhD; I could read and write code, squash bugs, and I wasn’t afraid of getting my hands dirty in monolithic code bases.
As such, I felt comfortable at the command line but I failed to learn the basic tenets of proper code maintenance, unit testing, code review, version control, etc., that underpin good software engineering.
While I had enough coding experience to have a sense of this at the time, I lacked the awareness of what I needed to know in order to improve or even where to start looking.</p>

<p>As is clear from the earlier statistic, this experience is likely not unique to me.
It prompted me to share what I’ve learned since joining Invenia 18 months ago, so that it might guide those looking to make a similar move.
The advice I provide is organised into three sections: the first recommends ways to learn a new programming language efficiently<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>; the second describes some best practices you can adopt to improve the quality of the code you write; and the last commends the social aspect of community-driven software collaborations.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-hone-your-craft">Lesson 1: Hone your craft</h2>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: While clichéd, there is no avoiding the fact that it takes consistent practice <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">over many many years</a> to become masterful at anything, and programming is no exception.</p>

<p><strong>Have personal projects</strong>: Practicing is easier said than done if your job doesn’t revolve around programming.
A good way to get started either way is to undertake personal side-projects as a fun way to get to grips with a language, for instance via <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle Competitions</a>, etc.
These should be enough to get you off the ground and familiar with the syntax of the language.</p>

<p><strong>Read code</strong>: Personal projects on their own are not enough to improve. 
If you really want to get better, you’ve got to read other people’s code: a lot of it.
Check out the repositories of some of your favourite or most used packages—particularly if they are considered “high quality”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
See how the package is organised, how the documentation is written, and how the code is structured.
Look at the open issues and pull requests.
Who are the main contributors? Get a sense of what is being worked on and how the open-source community operates.
This will give you an idea of the open issues facing the package and the language and the direction it is taking.
It will also show you how to write <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/84102/what-is-idiomatic-code"><em>idiomatic code</em></a>, that is, in a way that is natural for that language.</p>

<p><strong>Contribute</strong>: You should actually contribute to the code base you use.
This is by far the most important advice for improving and I cannot overstate how instructive an experience this is.
By getting your code reviewed you get prompt and informative feedback on what you’re doing wrong and how you can do better.
It gives you the opportunity to try out what you’ve learned, learn something new, and improves your confidence in your ability.
Contributing to open source and seeing your features being used is also rewarding, and that starts a positive feedback loop where you feel like contributing more.
Further, when you start applying for jobs in industry people can see your work, and so know that you are good at what you do (I say this as a person who is now involved in reviewing these applications).</p>

<p><strong>Study</strong>: Learning by experience is great but—at least for me—it takes a deliberate approach to formalise and cement new ideas.
Read well-reviewed books on your language (appropriate for your level) and reinforce what you learn by tackling more complex tasks and venturing <a href="https://www.geeksaresexy.net/2016/12/20/comfort-zone-comic/">outside your comfort zone</a>.
Reading blog posts and articles about the language is also a great idea.</p>

<p><strong>Ask for help:</strong> Sometimes a bug just stumps you, or you just don’t know how to implement a feature.
In these circumstances, it’s quicker to reach out to experts who can help and maybe teach you something at the same time.
More often than not, someone has had the same problem or they’re happy to point you in the right direction.
I’m fortunate to work with Julia experts at Invenia, so when I have a problem they are always most helpful.
But posting on public fora like <a href="https://slackinvite.julialang.org/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/">Discourse</a>, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> is an option we all have.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-2-software-engineering-practices">Lesson 2: Software Engineering Practices</h2>
<p>With respect to the environment and incentives in industry surrounding code maintainability, robustness, and testing, there are certain practices in place to encourage, enable, and ensure these qualities are met.
These key practices can turn a collection of scripts into a fully implemented package one can use and rely upon with high confidence.</p>

<p>While there are without doubt many universities and courses that teach these practices to their students, I find they are often neglected by coding novices and academics alike, to their own disadvantage.</p>

<p><strong>Take version control seriously:</strong> <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a programming staple for version control, and while it is tempting to disregard it when working alone, without it you soon find yourself creating <a href="https://uidaholib.github.io/get-git/1why.html">convoluted naming schemes</a> for your files; frequently losing track of progress; and wasting time looking through email attachments for the older version of the code to replace the one you just messed up.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> can be <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">a little intimidating</a> to get started, but once you are comfortable with the basic commands (fetch, add, commit, push, pull, merge) and a few others (checkout, rebase, reset) you will never look back.
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s utility, meanwhile, extends far beyond that of a programmatic hosting service; it provides <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/">documentation hosting</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-and-testing-code-with-continuous-integration/about-continuous-integration">CI/CD pipelines</a>, and many other features that enable efficient cross-party collaboration on an <em>enterprise</em> scale.</p>

<p>It cannot be overstated how truly indispensable <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are when it comes to turning your code into functional packages, and the earlier you adopt these the better.
It also helps to know how <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> works, so you will know what it means to increment a package version from 1.2.3 to 1.3 and why.</p>

<p><strong>Organise your code</strong>: In terms of packaging your code, get to know the typical package folder structure.
Packages often contain src, docs, and test directories, as well as standard …</p></div></div></div>

        <p>July 7, 2020</p>
		
<p>Like many other Github users, I am not a big fan of their recent repository page redesign. In my mind it seems like a change just for the sake of change – the original UI worked perfectly fine.</p>



<p><em>Sigh.</em></p>



<p>I was planning on recreating the original Github layout with custom CSS but decided against it. Tackling such a big change in design would cause headaches if Github ever changed even one simple class or id on a given element. My final conclusion was to just improve their new design with my own personal quality of life improvements.</p>



<p>So, enough chit-chat. Let’s get into it.</p>



<h2>Current Design (2020)</h2>



<p>The default view for a repo’s “homepage” and ticket items are locked at a set <code>max-width</code>. This causes some visual strain in comparison to the full-width headers and navigations directly above. I use a decently sized montior when using your app Gitub – <strong>let me use all the space available to me</strong>!</p>

<h2>My Improvements</h2>



<p>Your users shouldn’t have to jump around the page looking for the important information they want to see. Resetting the basic repo information to the left side of the screen allows user to <em>instantly</em> read-up on the project details. (This design is catered towards left-to-right readers mind you).</p>



<p>We now also utilize all the available screen space, dependent on the user’s browser window size.</p>

<p>We make similar updates to the ticket item view and also remove the out-of-place <code>margin-bottom</code> from the project link headers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-1024x509.png" alt="" srcset="https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-1024x509.png 1024w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-300x149.png 300w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-768x382.png 768w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-1536x764.png 1536w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3.png 1908w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Github  ticket items now align better with their header siblings</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Try It Yourself!</h2>



<p>You can very easily implement these custom CSS changes with an extension for the browser of your choice:</p>



<ul><li>Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a></li><li>Chrome: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha">Stylebot</a></li></ul>



<p>Then create a new custom CSS file to target <code>github.com</code> with the following properties:</p>



<pre><code>.container-xl {
    max-width: 100%;
}

.repository-content .gutter-condensed.gutter-lg {
    flex-direction: row-reverse !important;
}

.repository-content #discussion_bucket .gutter-condensed.gutter-lg {
    flex-direction: row !important;
}

.repohead &gt; div.d-flex {
    margin-bottom: 0 !important;
}

#show_issue {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.repository-content #discussion_bucket,
#partial-discussion-header {
    width: 100%;
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s it! Feel free to improve on this and further make it your own! I might create a new repo for this project if I end up adding even more improvements to the core CSS.</p>

The bug allowed attackers to do infinitely large transactions without paying any extra fees. The vulnerability was the result of a buggy implementation of fee calculation in the FRAME runtime of Substrate. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could’ve added their manga collection to the payload of a simple transaction without paying any extra fees. This would’ve resulted in the manga collection becoming a part of the blockchain, forever. Cheapest decentralized blockchain storage!</p><p>Sample fees for a 2 megabyte payload before the bug-fix:<br><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-50-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-50-18.png 494w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-50-18-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px"><br></p><p>Sample fees for a 2 megabyte payload after the bug-fix:<br><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-52-32.png" alt="" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-52-32.png 439w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-52-32-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px"></p><p>Please note that this bug is now fixed and a runtime upgrade has been deployed to Kusama, Polkadot and Polymesh Aldebaran testnet.</p><h3>Bug details</h3><p>The transaction fee is supposed to increase as the size of the transaction increases. There’s a constant <code>TransactionByteFee</code> that is supposed to be added to the total fee for every byte of data contained in the transaction. This would’ve prevented the above exploit from working but due to a very tiny bug in the code, this fee was not being applied under certain circumstances.</p><p>The fee was being calculated as:</p><pre><code>fee = base_fee + targeted_fee_adjustment * (len_fee + weight_fee);</code></pre><ul><li><code>base_fee</code> is a static fee applied to all transactions (analogous to the 21k gas fee in Ethereum).</li><li><code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> is a fee multiplier that is based on recent activity on the chain. If the recent blocks have been full, this multiplier will increase and if the recent blocks have been empty, this multiplier will decrease.</li><li><code>len_fee</code> is the extra fee charged for the size of a transaction. Transactions with bigger payloads will have a bigger <code>len_fee</code>.</li><li><code>weight_fee</code> is based on the compute requirements of a transaction. A more resource-intensive transaction will have a higher <code>weight_fee</code>.</li></ul><p>There are two problems here. Firstly, the <code>len_fee</code> is being affected by the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> multiplier. However, as per the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/Token%20Economics.html#setting-transaction-fees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W3F docs</a>, it should not be. The second problem is that the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> multiplier was allowed to go as low as zero. The combined result of these two problems is that when the chain is not busy, no <code>len_fee</code>, and <code>weight_fee</code> are charged and anyone can submit large transactions to inflate the blockchain size.</p><h3>Reproduction steps</h3><p>The vulnerability was very easy to exploit. All you had to do was to send a huge payload alongside a valid transaction. Sample reproduction steps are as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Polkadot UI – <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"></a><a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps">https://polkadot.js.org/apps</a>.</li><li>Click on the “Extrinsics” tab on the left.</li><li>Select the “remark” extrinsic from the “system” frame.</li><li>Click on “file upload” on the right and upload your payload (anything you want to put on the blockchain).</li><li>Submit the transaction.</li></ol><h3>Resolution</h3><p>The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/6334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fix</a> was twofold but simple. Firstly, the <code>len_fee</code> was moved out so that it was not affected by the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> multiplier. The new fee formula is</p><pre><code>fee = base_fee + len_fee + targeted_fee_adjustment * weight_fee;</code></pre><p>In addition, the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> was adjusted so that the minimum multiplier is one instead of zero. This brings the implementation closer to what the W3F research suggested. It makes exploit like the one mentioned in this post impossible.</p><h3>Timeline</h3><ul><li>Reported – 17/06/2020</li><li>Acknowledged – 17/06/2020</li><li>Fixed – 17/06/2020</li></ul><h3>Addendum</h3><p>I’d like to thank Parity Technologies for being responsive and fixing the bug within hours of the report. Kusama and Polkadot were upgraded soon after the bug fix. Parity offered me a 250 USD bug bounty for this disclosure which they have kindly donated to the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smile Foundation</a> on my behalf. I’d like to thank them for that as well.</p><p>Everyone is welcome to try their hands on Kusama and report any bugs to Parity. Below is a direct quote from Fredrik, CTO at parity:</p><blockquote><p>We are thankful to Mudit for reporting this to us. We created Kusama for this specific purpose of testing the underlying economic assumptions before they reach Polkadot and are happy that it worked in this case.

  <p>Published on 06 Jul 2020</p>
  
  <p>Go’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32825">infamous error handling</a> has caught quite the attention from outsiders to the programming language, often touted as one of the language’s most questionable design decisions. If you look into any project on Github written in Go, it’s almost a guarantee you’ll see the lines more frequently than anything else in the codebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Although it may seem redundant and unnecessary for those new to the language, the reason errors in Go are treated as first-class citizens (values) has a deeply-rooted history in programming language theory and the main goal of Go as a language itself. Numerous efforts have been made to change or improve how Go deals with errors, but so far, one proposal is winning above all others:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QvF1AbH.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>- <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32825">Leave if err != nil alone!</a></p>

<h2 id="gos-error-philosophy">Go’s error philosophy</h2>

<p>Go’s philosophy regarding error handling forces developers to incorporate errors as first class citizens of most functions they write. Even if you ignore an error using something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span><span> </span><span>getUserFromDB</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>User</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>user</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>getUserFromDB</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Most linters or IDEs will catch that you’re ignoring an error, and it will certaintly be visible to your teammates during code review. However, in other languages, it may not be clear that your code is not handling a potential exception in a <code>try catch</code> code block, being completely opaque about handling your control flow.</p>

<p>If you handle errors in Go the standard way, you get the benefits of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No hidden control-flows</li>
  <li>No unexpected <code>uncaught exception</code> logs blowing up your terminal (aside from actual program crashes via panics)</li>
  <li>full-control of errors in your code as <em>values</em> you can handle, return, and do anything you want with</li>
</ol>

<p>Not only is the syntax of <code>func f() (value, error)</code> easy to teach to a newcomer, but also a standard in any Go project which ensures consistency.</p>

<p>It’s important to note Go’s error syntax does not <strong>force</strong> you to handle every error your program may throw. Go simply provides a pattern to ensure you think of errors as critical to your program flow, but not much else. At the end of your program, if an error occurs, and you find it using <code>err != nil</code>, and your application doesn’t do something actionable about it, you’re in trouble either way - <strong>Go can’t save you</strong>. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>criticalDatabaseOperation</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>// Only logging the error without returning it to stop control flow (bad!)</span><span>
    </span><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Something went wrong in the DB: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>saveUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"Could not save user: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If something goes wrong and <code>err != nil</code> in calling <code>criticalDatabaseOperation()</code>, we’re not doing anything with the error aside from logging it! We might have data corruption or an otherwise unexpected issue that we are not handling intelligently, either via retrying the function call, canceling further program flow, or in worst-case scenario, shutting down the program. Go isn’t magical and can’t save you from these situations. Go only provides a standard approach for returning and using errors as values, but you still have to figure out how to handle the errors yourself.</p>

<h3 id="how-other-languages-do-it-throwing-exceptions">How other languages do it: throwing exceptions</h3>

<p>In something like the Javascript Node.js runtime, you can structure your programs as follows, known as throwing <code>exceptions</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>criticalOperation1</span><span>();</span>
    <span>criticalOperation2</span><span>();</span>
    <span>criticalOperation3</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If an error occurs in any of these functions, the stack trace for the error will pop up at runtime and will be logged to the console, but there is no explicit, programmatic handling of what went wrong.</p>

<p>Your <code>criticalOperation</code> functions don’t need to explicitly handle error flow, as any exception that occurs within that try block will be raised at runtime along with a stack trace of what went wrong.
A benefit to exception-based languages is that, compared to Go, even an unhandled exception will still be raised via a stack trace at runtime if it occurs. In Go, it is possible to not handle a critical error at all, which can arguably be much worse. Go offers you full control of error handling, but also <strong>full responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Exceptions are definitely not the only way other languages deal with errors. Rust,  for example, has a good compromise of using option types and pattern matching to find error conditions, leveraging some nice syntactic sugar to achieve similar results.</p>

<h3 id="why-go-doesnt-use-exceptions-for-error-handling">Why Go doesn’t use exceptions for error handling</h3>

<h4 id="the-zen-of-go">The Zen of Go</h4>

<p>The Zen of Go mentions two important proverbs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplicity matters</li>
  <li>Plan for failure, not success</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the simple <code>if err != nil</code> snippet to all functions which return <code>(value, error)</code> helps ensure failure in your programs is thought of <em>first and foremost</em>. You don’t need to wrangle with complicated, nested <code>try catch</code> blocks which appropriately handle all possible exceptions being raised.</p>

<h4 id="exception-based-code-can-often-be-opaque">Exception-based code can often be opaque</h4>

<p>With exception-based code, however, you’re forced to be aware of every situation in which your code could have exceptions without actually handling them, as they’ll be caught by your <code>try catch</code> blocks. That is, it encourages programmers to never check errors, knowing that at the very least, some exception will be handled automatically at runtime if it occurs.</p>

<p>A function written in an exception-based programming language may often look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>item</span> <span>=</span> <span>getFromDB</span><span>()</span>
<span>item</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span>
<span>saveToDB</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
<span>item</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span> <span>=</span> <span>'price changed'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code does nothing to ensure exceptions are properly handled. Perhaps the difference between making the code above become aware of exceptions is to switch the order of <code>saveToDB(item)</code> and <code>item.Text = 'price changed</code>, which is <strong>opaque</strong>, hard to reason about, and can encourage some lazy programming habits. In functional programming jargon, this is known as the fancy term: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28992625/exceptions-and-referential-transparency/28993780#28993780">violating referential transparency</a>. This <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=36693">blog post</a> from Microsoft’s engineering blog in 2005 still holds true today, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point isn’t that exceptions are bad.
My point is that exceptions are too hard and I’m not smart
enough to handle them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="benefits-of-gos-error-syntax">Benefits of Go’s error syntax</h2>

<h3 id="easy-creation-of-actionable-error-chains">Easy creation of actionable error chains</h3>

<p>A superpower of the pattern <code>if err != nil</code> is how it allows for easy error-chains to traverse a program’s hierarchy all the way to where they need to be handled. For example, a common Go error handled by a program’s <code>main</code> function might read as follows:</p>

<p>[2020-07-05-9:00] ERROR: Could not create user: could not check if user already exists in DB: could not establish database connection: no internet</p>

<p>The error above is (a) clear, (b) actionable, (c) has sufficient context as to what layers of the application went <em>wrong</em>. Instead of blowing up with an unreadable, cryptic stack trace, errors like these that are a result of factors we can add human-readable context to, and should be handled via clear error chains as shown above.</p>

<p>Moreover, this type of error chain arises naturally as part of a standard Go program’s structure, likely looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// In controllers/user.go</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"could not create user: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>// In database/user.go</span><span>
</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Database</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>CreateUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>User</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>}</span><span>

    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The beauty of the code above is that each of these errors are completely namespaced by their respective function, are informative, and only handle responsibility for what they are aware of. This sort of error chaining using <code>fmt.Errorf("something went wrong: %w", err)</code> makes it trivial to build awesome error messages that can tell you <em>exactly</em> what went wrong based on how <em>you</em> defined it.</p>

<p>On top of this, if you want to also attach a stack trace to your functions, you can utilize the fantastic <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/pkg/errors">github.com/pkg/errors</a> library, giving you functions such as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>errors</span><span>.</span><span>Wrapf</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"could not save user with email %s"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>email</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>which print out a stack trace <em>along</em> with the human-readable error chain you created through your code. If I could summarize the most important pieces of advice I’ve received regarding writing idiomatic error handling in Go:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add stack traces when your errors are actionable to developers</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do something with your returned errors, don’t just bubble them up to main, log them, and forget them</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep your error chains unambiguous</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When I write Go code, error handling is the one thing I <em>never</em> worry about, because errors themselves are a central aspect of every function I write, giving me full control in how I handle them safely, in a readable manner, and responsibly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“if …; err != nil” is something you’ll probably type if you write go. I don’t think it’s a plus or a negative. It gets the job done, it’s easy to understand, and it empowers the programmer to do the right thing when the program fails. The rest is up to you.</p>

            <p>Fractally broken a definition.</p>

<p><strong>Fractal</strong>: <em>A never ending pattern.</em><br><strong>Broken</strong>: <em>Not functioning properly.</em></p>

<p>This is a phrase I heard from <a href="https://kragniz.eu/">Louis Taylor</a> a few years ago and I absolutely love it. <em>Edit: I have been told that the original source may have been <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee</a>.</em></p>

<p>It means that however much you zoom in or out from a thing it has faults. In an almost recursive manner.</p>

<p>It really sums up some projects. You look at the whole system and think some very bad words. Then you look at a component and think the same. Finally, you end up reading individual lines of code and the words continue flowing.</p>

<p>I also composed a limerick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There once was a very bad project,</p>

  <p>With a fixed cost, scope and budget,</p>

  <p>It grew fractally broken,</p>

  <p>And the severs began smokin’,</p>

  <p>so none of the dev’s wanted to touch it.</p>

			<p><b>Pulsar vs Kafka</b> – which one is better? This blog post explores <b>pros and cons, popular myths, and non-technical criteria to find the best tool for your business problem</b>.</p>
<p>My discussions are usually around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem as I work for Confluent. <b>The only questions I got about Pulsar in the last years came from Pulsar committers and contributors</b>. They asked me deep technical questions so as to be able to explain where Kafka sucks and why Pulsar is the much better option. Discussions about this topic on platforms like Reddit are typically very opinionated, often inaccurate, and brutal. The following is my point of view based on years of experience with open source streaming platforms.</p>
<h2 id="tech-comparisons-are-the-new-black-kafka-vs-middleware-event-streaming-and-api-platforms">Tech comparisons are the new black: Kafka vs. Middleware, Event Streaming and API Platforms</h2>
<p>Tech comparisons are meant to <b>guide people to choose the right solution and architecture for their business problem</b>. There is no all-rounder, and there should be no bias. Choose the right tool for the problem.</p>
<p>However, <strong>technical comparisons are almost always biased</strong>. Even if the author does not work for a vendor and is an “independent” consultant, he or she is still likely to have a biased opinion from past experiences and knowledge, whether purposely or unknowingly. Still, comparisons from different perspectives are useful, and we’ve seen Apache Pulsar discussed in a few places on the internet, so I wanted to share my personal views of how Kafka and Pulsar compare. <strong>I work for Confluent, the leading experts behind Apache Kafka and its ecosystem</strong>, so keep that in mind, but the aim of this post is not to provide opinion, it’s to <b>weigh up facts rather than myths</b>.</p>
<p>Technical comparisons of open source frameworks and commercial software products happen all the time. I did several comparisons in the past on my blog or other platforms like InfoQ, including a <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2012/01/10/spoilt-for-choice-which-integration-framework-to-use-spring-integration-mule-esb-or-apache-camel/">Comparison of integration frameworks</a>, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/ESB-Integration">Choosing the right ESB for your integration needs</a>, <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2019/03/07/apache-kafka-middleware-mq-etl-esb-comparison/">Kafka vs. ETL / ESB / MQ</a>, <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2020/04/24/mainframe-offloading-replacement-apache-kafka-connect-ibm-db2-mq-cdc-cobol/">Kafka vs. Mainframe</a> and <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2020/05/25/api-management-gateway-apache-kafka-comparison-mulesoft-kong-apigee/">Apache Kafka and API Management / API Gateway</a>. All these comparisons were done because customers wanted to understand when to use which tool.</p>
<p>For Pulsar vs. Kafka, the situation is a little bit different.</p>
<h2 id="why-compare-pulsar-and-kafka">Why compare Pulsar and Kafka?</h2>
<p><b>Talking to prospects or customers, I rarely get asked about Pulsar.</b> To be fair, this increased slightly in the last months. I guess the question comes up in every ~15th or ~20th meeting due to the overlapping feature set and use cases. However, this seems to be mostly due to a few posts on the internet that claim Pulsar is in some ways better than Kafka. There is no fact checking andou very little material, if any, for the opposing view.</p>
<p><b>I have not talked to a single organization who seriously considered deploying Pulsar in production, </b>although I know there are a large number of users out there in the world who need a distributed messaging technology like Kafka or Pulsar. But I also think that Pulsar’s alleged reference users are not particularly accurate. For example, their flagship user is Tencent, a large Chinese tech company, but Tencent is a huge Kafka user, whereas Pulsar’s use is limited to just one project.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-of-two-competitive-open-source-frameworks">Comparison of two competitive open source frameworks</h4>
<p><b>Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar are two exciting and competing technologies</b>. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to compare them. Period.</p>
<p><strong>Both Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar have very similar feature sets</strong>. I recommend that you evaluate both frameworks for available features, maturity, market adoption, open source tools and projects, training material, availability of local meetups, videos, blog posts, etc. Reference use cases from your industry or business problems help making the right decision.</p>
<p>Confluent published such a comparison about “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">Kafka vs. Pulsar vs. RabbitMQ: Performance, Architecture, and Features Compared</a>“. I was involved in creating this comparison. So we have that comparison already…</p>
<p>What is this blog post here about then?</p>
<p>I want to <b>explore the myths from some ‘Kafka vs. Pulsar’ arguments</b> which I see regularly in blog posts and forum discussions. Afterwards, I will give a more <b>comprehensive comparison beyond just technical aspects</b> because most Pulsar discussions focus purely on tech features.</p>

<h2 id="kafka-vs-pulsar-technology-myths-explored">Kafka vs Pulsar – Technology myths explored<b><br>
</b></h2>
<p><b>The following discusses some myths I have come across. I agree with some of them, but also counter some others with hard facts</b>. Of course, different opinions can exist for some of these statements. Again, this is totally fine. The following is my point of view.</p>
<h3 id="myth-1-pulsar-has-differentiating-built-in-features-compared-to-kafka">Myth 1: “Pulsar has differentiating built-in features compared to Kafka”?</h3>
<p><b>True.</b></p>
<p>If you compare Apache Kafka to Apache Pulsar, features like its tiered architecture, queuing, and multi-tenancy are mentioned as differentiators.</p>
<p><b>But:</b></p>
<p>Kafka has many differentiating features, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half as many servers to run</li>
<li>Data saved to disk only once</li>
<li>Data cached in memory only once</li>
<li>Battle-tested replication protocol</li>
<li>Zero copy performance</li>
<li>Transactions</li>
<li>Built-in stream processing</li>
<li>Long term storage</li>
<li>In the works: ZooKeeper removal (<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum">KIP-500</a>), which makes Kafka even more simple to operate and deploy than Pulsar (which has a four-component architecture of Pulsar, ZooKeeper, BookKeeper, and RocksDB), apart from making Kafka more scalable, more resilient, etc. etc..)</li>
<li>In the works: Tiered Storage (<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage">KIP-405</a>), which makes Kafka more elastic and cost-efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also ask yourself: Should you really compare just the open source frameworks or products and vendors with their complete offering?</p>
<p>It is <b>easy to add new features if you don’t have to provide mission-critical support for it</b>. Don’t just evaluate features in a checklist, but also evaluate how they are battle-tested in production scenarios. <b>How many “differentiating features” are low-quality and implemented quickly vs. high-quality implementations?</b></p>
<p>For instance: <b>It took a few years to implement and battle-test Kafka Streams as Kafka-native stream processing engine. Do you really want to compare this to Pulsar Functions?</b> The latter is a feature to add user-defined functions (UDF); without any relation to “real stream processing”. Or is this more like Single Message Transformations (SMT), a core feature of Kafka Connect? Just be sure to a) compare apples to apples (instead of apples to oranges) and b) don’t forget to think about the maturity of a feature. The more powerful and critical, the more mature it should be…</p>
<p>The Kafka community spends a large amount of efforts to improve the core project and its ecosystem. <b>Confluent alone has over 200 full time engineers</b> working on the Kafka project, additional community components, commercial products and the SaaS offering on major cloud providers.</p>
<h3 id="myth-2-pulsar-has-a-few-very-big-users-like-tencent-in-china">Myth 2: “Pulsar has a few very big users like Tencent in China”?</h3>
<p><b>True.</b></p>
<p><b>But: Tencent actually uses Kafka more than Pulsar</b>. The billing, which uses Pulsar, department is only a small fraction at Tencent, whereas a large portion of the core business is using Kafka, and they have a Global-Kafka like architecture that combines 1000+ brokers into a single logical cluster.</p>
<p>Always be cautious with open source projects. Check out the success at “normal companies”. Just because a tech giant uses it, does not mean it will work for your company well. How many Fortune 2000 companies shared their success stories around Pulsar in the past?</p>
<h4 id="look-for-proof-points-beyond-tech-giants">Look for proof points beyond tech giants!</h4>
<p><b>Proof points beyond the tech giants are helpful to get insights and lessons learned from other people</b>. Not from the software vendors. The Kafka website gives many <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by">examples about mission-critical deployments</a>. Even more impressive: At the past<a href="https://kafka-summit.org/"> Kafka Summit</a> conferences in San Francisco, New York and London, every year various enterprises from different industries present their use cases and success stories. Including fortune 2000 companies, mid-size enterprises and startups.</p>
<p>Just to give you <b>one specific example in the Kafka world</b>: Various different implementations exist for replication of data in real time between separate Kafka clusters, including MirrorMaker 1 (part of the Apache Kafka project), MirrorMaker 2 (part of the Apache Kafka project), Confluent Replicator (built by Confluent and only available as part of Confluent Platform or Confluent Cloud), uReplicator (open sourced by Uber), Mirus (open sourced by Salesforce), Brooklin (open sourced by LinkedIn).</p>
<p>In practice, only two options are reasonable if you don’t want to maintain and improve the code by yourself: MirrorMaker 2 (very new, not mature yet, but a great option mid and long term) and Confluent Replicator (battle-tested in many mission-critical deployments, but not open source). All the other options work, too. But who maintains the projects? Who solves bugs and security issues? Who do you call when you have a problem in production? Deployment in production for mission-critical deployments is different from evaluating and trying out an open source project.</p>
<h3 id="myth-3-pulsar-provides-message-queuing-and-event-streaming-in-a-single-solution">Myth 3: “Pulsar provides message queuing and event streaming in a single solution”?</h3>
<p><b>True.</b></p>
<p>Message queues are used for point-to-point communication. They provide an asynchronous communications protocol, meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.</p>
<p>I really like the support of Message Queuing in Pulsar. This means you have <b>out-of-the-box support for event streaming and message queues in Pulsar</b>.</p>
<p>In Kafka, different workarounds are required to realize “real queuing” behavior.</p>
<p>Having said this, I typically ask customers what exactly they want to do with queuing. Often, Kafka provides out-of-the-box solutions for the use case which simply require thinking of the solution in new terms.</p>
<p>If you want to use separate message queues instead of shared Kafka topics for:</p>

<li>Security? =&gt; Use Kafka’s ACLs (and optional tools like Confluent’s role-based access control aka RBAC)).</li>

				        PGA is a <b>plane-based geometric algebra</b> which appears eminently suited for the description and computation of operations in <b>3D Euclidean geometry</b>. 
It naturally contains, in a real framework, efficient motion representations like homogeneous coordinates and  dual quaternions, fully integrated with oriented object models. 
PGA's encoding of primitives and operators in blocks of four coordinates makes it very suitable for <b>fast GPU
implementation</b>.</p><p>

To satisfy the curiosity raised by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX4H_ctggYo&amp;t=1080s" target="blank"><b>2019 SIGGRAPH</b></a> presentation on PGA, Leo Dorst decided to upgrade
<b>Chapter 11</b> of the 2007 book <a href="http://geometricalgebra.net/" target="blank"><b>Geometric Algebra for Computer Science (GA4CS)</b></a> to treat these new developments in a similarly precise but accessible style.
</p>
<p>

The present text assumes some <b>basic geometric algebra</b> knowledge (though it could be read without that, as a motivational inspiration to acquire that knowledge). 
Throughout, we try to be no more mathematical than required, and provide <b>illustrations</b> and links to <b>software demonstrations</b>.
</p><p>

This text takes care to propagate <b>orientational signs</b> and <b>scaling factors</b> through all its operations, since the author believes that PGA allows for such a consistently <b>oriented Euclidean geometry</b>. 
Guessing signs afterwards should no longer be required...</p><p>

Enjoy! We plan to post updates on new developments on this page, and in upgraded versions of this '<a href="https://bivector.net/PGA4CS.pdf">Guided Tour to the Plane-Based Geometric Algebra PGA</a>'.</p><p>

        Memory-sensitive languages like C++ and Rust use compile-time information to calculate
        sizes of datatypes. These sizes are used to inform alignment, allocation, and calling conventions in ways
        that improve runtime performance. Modern languages in this setting support generic types, but so far
        these languages only allow parameterisation over types, not type constructors. In this article I describe
        how to enable parameterisation over arbitrary type constructs, while still retaining compile-time calculation
        of datatype sizes.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>Many typed languages support some form of generic (parameterised) datatypes. This ability to abstract
over types is known as ‘parametric polymorphism’ (polymorphism for short). In Rust, for example, one
can define type of polymorphic pairs as <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>. In this definition, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are type 
variables (or type parameters), and can be substituted for other types: 
<code>Pair&lt;bool, bool&gt;</code>, <code>Pair&lt;bool, char&gt;</code>, and <code>Pair&lt;String, int32&gt;</code> are all valid pairs.</p>

<p>The name of a type, without any parameters, is known as a type constructor. <code>Pair</code> is not a type on its own; 
<code>Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> (for some types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>) is. The number of types required to ‘complete’ a type constructor is known
as its arity (so <code>Pair</code> has arity 2). The arity of a type constructor must always be respected; it’s an error to 
provide greater or fewer type parameters than are expected. For example, <code>Pair&lt;bool&gt;</code> and 
<code>Pair&lt;char, int32, String&gt;</code> are invalid.</p>

<h3 id="sizing">Sizing</h3>

<p>When using C++ or Rust, the compiler will calculate how many bytes of memory each datatype requires. Simple
types like <code>int32</code> and <code>bool</code> have a constant size; 4 bytes and 1 byte respectively. The size of datatypes 
built using of other simple types is easy to calculate. The simplest way to calculate the size of a struct 
is to sum the sizes of the fields, and the simplest way to calculate the size of an enum (or tagged union)
is to find the largest variant, and add 1 (for a tag byte). This is rarely the exact formula used by production
compilers, because they take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">alignment</a> into account.
This article will assume the simple sizing formula, because the results can easily be adapted to more nuanced
formulae.</p>

<p>The size of a datatype like <code>struct TwoInts(x: int32, y: int32)</code> is known immediately at its definition. <code>TwoInts</code>
requires 8 bytes of memory. On the other hand, the size of a generic datatype is not always known at its definition.
What is the size of <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>? It’s the size of <code>A</code> plus the size of <code>B</code>, for some 
unknown <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>This difficulty is usually addressed by only generating code for datatypes and functions when all the generic
types have been replaced with concrete types. This process is known as monomorphisation. If the program contains a 
<code>Pair(true, true)</code>, then the compiler will generate
a new type <code>struct PairBoolBool(fst: bool, snd: bool)</code> whose size is statically known. If <code>Pair(true, true)</code>
is passed to a function <code>fn swap&lt;A, B&gt;(p: Pair&lt;A, B&gt;) -&gt; Pair&lt;B, A&gt;</code>, then the compiler generates a new
function <code>fn swapBoolBool(p: PairBoolBool) -&gt; PairBoolBool</code>. Because this new function only uses types with known
sizes, the code for memory allocation and calling conventions can be generated correctly.</p>

<p>There are also generic types that <em>don’t</em> depend on the size of their parameters. An example of
this is the pointer, commonly known in Rust as <code>Box&lt;A&gt;</code>. A pointer has the same size (often 4 or 8 bytes depending
on your CPU) regardless of what it points to. But in order to allocate a new pointer, the size of the item must
be known.</p>

<p>For each generic datatype or function, the compiler keeps track of which type variables are important for sizing
calculations. The specifics of this is discussed in the <a href="#type-classes">Type Classes</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>A consequence of all this is that in these languages, type variables can only stand for types. But there
are good reasons to have type variables that stand for type constructors, too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>
  <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>
  <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are some 1-arity container types. The only difference between these datatypes is the number of elements
they contain. They all support a <code>map</code> operation, which applies a function to all the datatype’s elements. Functions
that use <code>map</code> need to be implemented once for each type, even when their implementations are identical:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incrOne</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrTwo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrThree</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remedy this, there must first be a way to abstract over the type constructors, so that the code can
be written <em>once</em> and for all:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>// when F&lt;A&gt; has map, for all types A</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there must be some way to rule out invalid types. For example, replacing <code>F</code> with <code>bool</code> in <code>F&lt;int32&gt;</code>
is invalid, because <code>bool&lt;int32&gt;</code> is not a type. This is the job of kinds<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Kinds describe the ‘shape’ of types (and type constructors) in the same way that types describe the ‘shape’ 
of values. A type’s kind determines whether or not it takes any parameters. Here’s the syntax of kinds:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kind ::=
  Type
  kind -&gt; kind
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Types that take no arguments (like <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, and <code>String</code>) have kind <code>Type</code>. Types that take one argument,
like <code>One</code>, have kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. In the code for <code>incr</code> above, <code>F</code> implicitly has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. Types
that take more than one argument are represented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried form</a>. This
means that <code>Two</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>, not <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code>. <code>Three</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>,
and so on.</p>

<p>Curried type constructors are standard in this setting, but not <em>necessary</em>. The results in this article could
also be applied to a setting with uncurried type constructors, at cost to expressiveness or implementation complexity.</p>

<p>Kinds put types and type constructors on equal footing. For the remainder of the article, both concepts will be
referred to as types. The kind becomes the distinguishing feature. For example, “type constructor of arity 2” would
be replaced by “type of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>”.</p>

<p>Some final jargon: types with a kind other than <code>Type</code> are known as ‘higher-kinded types’, and parameterising
over higher-kinded types is known as ‘higher-kinded polymorphism’.</p>

<h3 id="type-classes">Type Classes</h3>

<p>Rust uses <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html">traits</a> to coordinate sizing calculations. Each
datatype implicitly receives an implementation of the <code>Sized</code> trait, and every type variable that is relevant for
a sizing calculation is given a <code>Sized</code> bound. This means that trait resolution, an already useful feature, can
be re-used to perform size calculations.</p>

<p>Closely related to traits is the functional programming concept of type classes<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. There are differences between the two,
but those differences don’t impact the results of this article. Type classes will prove a more convenient language
in which to discuss these ideas.</p>

<p>A type class (or trait) can be considered a predicate on types. A type class constraint (or trait bound) is an assertion
that the predicate must be true. For each constraint that is satisfied, there is corresponding ‘evidence’ that the
predicate is true.</p>

<p>When a type <code>T</code> has a <code>Sized</code> constraint, it is being asserted that the statement “<code>T</code> has a known size” is true. For
brevity, this will be written as <code>Sized T</code>. When this statement satisfied (for instance, when <code>T</code> is <code>int32</code>), the
evidence is produced is <em>the actual size</em> of <code>T</code> (when <code>Sized int32</code> is satisfied, the evidence
is the number <code>4</code> - the size of <code>int32</code>).</p>

<p>Generic types like <code>Two&lt;A&gt;</code> have a size that depends on their type parameter. In terms of constraints, it can
be said that <code>Sized A</code> <em>implies</em> <code>Sized Two&lt;A&gt;</code>. If <code>A</code> is <code>int32</code>, then its size is <code>4</code>, which implies that
<code>Two&lt;int32&gt;</code> has a size of <code>4 + 4 = 8</code>. Similarly, of <code>Pair</code> it can be said that <code>Sized A</code> implies [ <code>Sized B</code> implies 
<code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> ]. There is a choice between a curried an uncurried version; it could also be said that
[ <code>Sized A</code> <em>and</em> <code>Sized B</code> ] implies <code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, but the curried version will be used for convenience.</p>

<p>Note that type <em>constructors</em> don’t have a size. In other words, only types of kind <code>Type</code> have a size. A type constructor
such as <code>Two</code> (of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>) has a size <em>function</em>. Given the sizes of the type constructor’s parameters,
a size function computes the size of the resulting datatype. <code>Two</code>’s size function is <code>\a -&gt; a + a</code>. <code>Pair</code>’s size
function <code>\a -&gt; b -&gt; a + b</code> (it could also be <code>\(a, b) -&gt; a + b</code> in an uncurried setting).</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>With the background out of the way, the specific problem can be stated:</p>

<p>When a type of kind <code>Type</code> is relevant for a size calculation, it is given a <code>Sized</code> constraint, which will be
satisfied with a concrete size as evidence. What is the equivalent notion of constraint and evidence for
higher-kinded types that contribute to size calculations?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>An elegant solution to this problem can found by introducing quantified class constraints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Quantified constraints 
are an extension to type classes that add implication and quantification to the language of constraints, and corresponding
notions of evidence.</p>

<p>Here’s new syntax of quantified size constraints:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constraint ::=
  Sized type               (size constraint)
  constraint =&gt; constraint (implication constraint)
  forall A. constraint     (quantification constraint)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The evidence for a constraint <code>c1 =&gt; c2</code> is a function that takes evidence for <code>c1</code> and produces evidence for <code>c2</code>, and the
evidence for <code>forall A. c</code> is just the evidence for <code>c</code>. The evidence for quantification constraints is a bit more nuanced
in general, but this description is accurate when only …</p></article></section></div>

            <p>
                Let’s build a new Fiverr or Upwork, but something much more smaller and fun? I started to build something. Would be fun to hear your thoughts.
            </p>
        </div><div>
                        <div>
            <p>RemoteHub is a community of remote workers. There are currently <a href="https://remotehub.io/open/users">more than 1,000</a> members. They are full-time remote workers, freelancers, digital nomads.</p><p>We have a world full of great talent. Designers, developers, writers and other knowledge workers. I’ve been thinking about how to connect RemoteHub talents with people who need their help.</p><p>And now I need a help with one of my own projects (write responsive html/css based on designs) and I thought what a great way to start through this.</p><p>Btw, you can let me know if you’d like to work on the project:&nbsp;<a href="https://remotehub.io/freelance/mygames-website-development">https://remotehub.io/freelance/mygames-website-development</a></p>
        </div>
                                <div>
            <h2>Fiverr, Upwork etc</h2><p>I know freelancer marketplaces exist and I’m not looking to compete with them. They are huge. I’m thinking something much smaller.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many things I don’t like about these huge freelancer marketplaces. First, they take a lot of money from the talent’s pocket (20%?). But also because it seems that it’s mostly about competing about who makes the lowest offer (maybe I’m wrong about this).<br></p>
        </div>
                                <div>
            <h2>We have profiles here!</h2><p>RemoteHub members <a href="https://remotehub.io/blog/remote-work-user-profiles">build their profiles</a> – add something about yourself and list your skills. I should also add a way to showcase your projects!</p>
        </div>

            <h2>How to connect freelancers with clients?</h2><p>One way would be to just let clients post freelance jobs. Title and description. But that’s quite boring I think.</p><p>Maybe add a way to build out a project with tasks and let clients post their projects. Then freelancers browse these projects with tasks in them and decide if they would like to be part of it. More fun?<br></p><p>I started to play aroung with this and my first project is live (I’m looking for a freelance html/css human) – <b>you can let me know if you’re interested:</b></p><p><a href="https://remotehub.io/freelance/mygames-website-development">https://remotehub.io/freelance/mygames-website-development</a><br></p><p>I can see a list of members who apply and I can invite someone to the project. I would then work with this person here on RemoteHub, through tasks.</p>
        </div>
                                <div>
            <h2>Where to take this next?</h2><p>Here are some more ideas I’ve been thinking about:</p><p>1. <b>Client can have their network of freelancers.</b> You need something &gt; you create a task &gt; you share it with your network. Someone picks it up and pushes a button "I’ll do it".</p><p>2. <b>Freelancer friends.</b> Client needs a website design + coding and finds a designer on RemoteHub. But this client also needs coding when the design is ready. There can be "freelancer friends" (or something like that) – people who have been working together. So they know how to work together. It’s much better to order coding part from a friend of this designer from someone stranger.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy to talk with you! My email is raumet@hey.com</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>As you may know, Hashnode is a community of independent developers who blog on their own domain. Hashnode users discover content published by the bloggers on their feed. Since our users are logged in on Hashnode and <strong>not the custom domains</strong> where the articles live, we had to carry the session forward somehow. </p>
<p>For example, I am logged in on Hashnode, but I am reading a content published on a different Hashnode powered domain. For example:</p>

<p>How do we ensure that my session reflects on this domain so that I can like the post or write a comment?</p>
<h2 id="sso-on-our-own-cloud">SSO on our own cloud</h2>
<p>Initially we relied on third party cookies to do auth. We waited for the page to load fully and then made an API call to Hashnode to fetch the currently logged in user. It worked quite well. However, we soon realized that Safari blocks all third-party cookies!  So, we decided to implement SSO on Hashnode and activated it only for Safari users. Here is the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>User requests a blog and it hits one of our edge servers.</li>
<li>We detect if the user is on Safari. In that case we redirect them to <code>https://hashnode.com/identity</code> and pass a <code>next</code> query param which is the blog URL.</li>
<li>Hashnode checks for a login cookie. If found, we create a short lived token for the user and store it against a <code>guid</code>. We redirect the user back to the blog by appending <code>guid</code> as a query param.</li>
<li>After being redirected, the blog renders and our JavaScript code pulls in the <code>guid</code> and exchanges it with our server for an auth token.</li>
<li>Subsequent API calls use the auth token and send it in <code>x-auth-token</code> header to authenticate with Hashnode endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594031517862/FXfL-Qhds.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="hn-authentication-chart.png"></p>
<p>This worked quite well, but as you may have guessed the redirection process took a bit of time. Our edge caching didn't really matter since we redirected the requests to Hashnode before serving the content. But this flow was in place just for Safari. For Chrome, Firefox and other browsers, we served content straightaway from our edge cache and used third-party cookies to communicate with Hashnode.</p>
<p>However, we soon realized that Brave browser also blocks third-party cookies when privacy shield is on. Also, we didn't have any reliable way of knowing whether the request came from Brave browser. The <code>user-agent</code> header simply didn't give any info. A few days later, Chrome also joined the bandwagon and started blocking third-party cookies. Now our only choice was to redirect every request intended for Hashnode-powered domains to <code>https://hashnode.com</code> first and obtain auth token -- that meant we could no longer take advantage of our CDN. SSO would make the blogs slower. </p>
<p>After a few sleepless nights, I thought why not use Cloudflare Workers for implementing SSO? Worker scripts run in 150+ data centres across the globe and can handle millions of redirections easily! The best part is that the requests will be sent to a DC that is closest to the users. This means we can implement an SSO feature without sacrificing the speed and benefits of our own CDN.</p>
<p>So, last week I sat down to build this. Here is how it works:</p>
<h2 id="sso-on-cloudflare-workers">SSO on Cloudflare Workers</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, we already have a home grown CDN which routes user requests to locations that are geographically closest to our users. Since Workers also factor in geo proximity while serving requests, we came up with the following steps to implement SSO. It's largely same as our previous setup, but the redirection part is handled by Cloudflare Workers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Whenever a request comes for any specific domain in our network (e.g. <code>https://sandeep.dev</code>), we redirect the user to <code>https://hashnode.com/identity</code> which is powered by Workers. It passes the current hostname in a query param called <code>next</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The script checks if a login cookie is present in the request. If yes, it generates a short lived JWT token and a GUID. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The script stores the JWT against the generated GUID using Workers KV Store. It redirects the user to URL passed in <code>next</code> query param and sends the GUID along with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After redirection happens, the blog exchanges the <code>guid</code> for the short lived JWT and uses it to authenticate API calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how the worker script looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> next = getQueryParam(request, <span>'next'</span>); 

<span>if</span> (!next) { 
    <span>return</span> Response.redirect(<span>`https://hashnode.com`</span>, <span>302</span>);
}

next = <span>decodeURIComponent</span>(next);

<span>const</span> cookie = getCookie(request, <span>'login.jwt'</span>);

<span>if</span> (!cookie) { 
    <span>return</span> Response.redirect(<span>`<span>${next}</span>?guid=none`</span>, <span>302</span>);
}

<span>const</span> decodedJwt = jwt.verify(cookie, jwtSecret); 
<span>const</span> userId = decodedJwt.data.userId; 

<span>const</span> data = {
    userId: userId,
    expires: <span>new</span> <span>Date</span>().getTime() + (cookieTTL * <span>3600</span> * <span>1000</span>),
    v: <span>1</span>
}

<span>const</span> signedToken = jwt.sign(data, jwtSecret); 
<span>const</span> guid = uuidv4(); 
<span>await</span> guids.put(guid, signedToken, { expirationTtl: <span>60</span> }); 

<span>return</span> Response.redirect(<span>`<span>${next}</span>?guid=<span>${guid}</span>`</span>, <span>302</span>); 
</code></pre>
<p>Once the client extracts the GUID, it makes an API call and retrieves the JWT. Here's workers script for that accepts the GUID and responds back with the JWT:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> token = <span>await</span> guids.get(guidFromQuery); 
<span>const</span> origin = request.headers.get(<span>'origin'</span>);

<span>const</span> init = {
  headers: {
    <span>'Content-Type'</span>: <span>'application/json'</span>,
    <span>'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'</span>: origin,
    <span>'Access-Control-Allow-Headers'</span>: <span>'Content-Type'</span>
  }
}
guids.delete(guidFromQuery); 
<span>return</span> <span>new</span> Response(<span>JSON</span>.stringify({ token: token }), init);
</code></pre>
<p>It has been working out really well so far. We don't suffer if third party cookies are blocked in certain browsers. The performance doesn't degrade because the initial redirection is based on geo proximity. For example, if someone is accessing <code>sandeep.dev</code> from Bangalore then the initial redirection always goes to Bangalore/Singapore. Then the actual content is served from Bangalore.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the network tab, we'll notice that the TTFB value is still &lt; 500ms most of the times. The redirection is short and consumes &lt; 300ms. While this setup is slightly slower than serving content from CDN directly (without SSO), it solves one big problem which is <strong>Authentication</strong>. So, the slight reduction in speed is acceptable.</p>

<p>The best part is that Workers is handling this gracefully with 100% success rate so far.</p>

<hr>
<p>This is the first time I used Cloudflare Workers in a prod set up. You should definitely check it out if you have a similar use case. Additionally, do checkout KV store which is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-with-workers-kv/">fast distributed key-value store</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

</blockquote>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

July 7, 2020 | https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-iOS/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-iOS/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Previously we took a look at <a href="https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-Android/">Snapchat’s root detection methods on Android</a>. This time we are taking a look at how they detect jailbreaks, tweaks and hooks on iOS.</p>



<p>All the research in this post is based on Snapchat 10.65.0.66 (832559634).</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_login_message.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>This is the message you see when you try to login with a detected tweak, although not all tweaks trigger this message. Two examples that trigger this message are <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.johncoates.flex3/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9baacc/release_wraith_snapchatphantom_replacement/">Wraith</a>. Some just flag your account and will get you banned later in a ban wave if you are unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-bans">Avoiding bans</h2>

<p>So obviously the first thing we want to look at is, what has the community tried so far to stay hidden? If you google around a bit you will most likely end up with these result. For a few of them, I will list the most notable features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NoSub (or variants)
    <ul>
      <li>Disable Cydia Substrate / Substitute entirely for specific apps.</li>
      <li>Only if you can find an updated version and don’t want to use tweaks on Snapchat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NepetaDev/UnSub/blob/master/Tweak/Tweak.xm">UnSub</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Hooks and filters libc file system calls.</li>
      <li>Spoofs the libc getenv to remove the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> variable.</li>
      <li>Spoofs <code>_dyld_image_count</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name</code> to hide tweak related dylibs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/blob/master/Tweak.xm">Shadow</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Too much to list.. it hooks way too much.</li>
      <li>Still misses lots of stuff for Snapchat specifically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/jailbroken-iphone">Snapchat themselves recommend NoSub</a>..</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_snapchat_jailbroken_support.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>But it seems that nobody knows what Snapchat is <strong>exactly</strong> doing to detect everything. Which is why I am writing this post. Only one that I have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/cokepokes/status/1023114963550797824">publicly making efforts</a> to figure this out is the developer of Phantom, CokePokes.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-they-doing-it">How are they doing it?</h2>

<p>I will try my best to explain every check they do in Snapchat 10.65.0.66.</p>

<p>When you launch the app they create a new thread using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</a> that runs all the checks. At the end of these checks an integer is stored with flags of everything that was detected on the device. Some of these checks are then ran every 31 seconds.</p>

<p>All the code executed for these checks is obfuscated with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strong-codes">Snapchats in-house obfuscation tools</a> and thus very annoying to look at using tools such as IDA.</p>

<h3 id="code-signature-checks">Code signature checks</h3>

<p>One of the first things they do is checking and storing stuff from the code signature. This happens using the <code>sys_csops(169)</code> syscall, which is pretty much undocumented but is very similar to the code here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They execute the following operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_ENTITLEMENTS_BLOB</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important one of this is the <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code>, this retrieves the current codesigning status of the process. A jailbroken device can respond with messy status flags. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_INSTALLER</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_PLATFORM_BINARY</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DEBUGGED</code> (Process was debugged / is being debugged)</li>
  <li>Or missing <code>CS_VALID</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A normal device would have these flags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_VALID</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_HARD</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_KILL</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_ENFORCEMENT</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_REQUIRE_LV</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DYLD_PLATFORM</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_SIGNED</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For all available flags and their descriptions, see <a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/BUILD/obj/EXPORT_HDRS/osfmk/kern/cs_blobs.h.html#_M/CS_VALID">this page</a>.</p>

<p>The result of <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code> and <code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code> are stored and later sent to the Snapchat servers, encrypted.</p>

<h3 id="bundle-check">Bundle check</h3>

<p>This is a simple check but quite effective if not noticed by a tweak developer. Pseudo code looks like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 = CFBundleGetMainBundle()
x1 = CFBundleGetIdentifier(x0)
x2 = CFStringGetCStringPtr(x1)
strncmp("com.toyopagroup.picaboo", x2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dyld-check">Dyld check</h3>

<p>Snapchat has two methods to iterate all loaded dylibs.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h4>

<p>One way is using <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L48">dyld_get_image_header</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dladdr1.3.html">dladdr</a>. They iterate over <code>dyld_get_image_header</code> until it returns null and checks if it has seen everything with <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L47">dyld_image_count</a>. The <code>dladdr</code> method provides them with the path of the dylib. These are checked against a few unknown strings but removing everything substrate related from the dyld list fixes this check.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h4>

<p>The other method they use is calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1537934-task_info">task_info</a> with flavor <code>TASK_DYLD_INFO</code>. This also gives them a list of all loaded dylibs and must be fixed separately from the first dyld check.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-checks">File system checks</h3>

<p>There are a couple of file system checks, of which all use the <code>sys_access(33)</code> syscall.</p>

<h4 id="first-list">First list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/Library/Application Support/PhLite/phlite.bundle/AuthAPI.pem</li>
  <li>/private/var/tmp/cydia.log</li>
  <li>/bin/bash</li>
  <li>/usr/sbin/sshd</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/sftp-server</li>
  <li>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</li>
  <li>/.installed_yaluX</li>
  <li>/Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist</li>
  <li>/usr/local/bin/dropbear</li>
  <li>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/enable-dylibs-to-override-cache</li>
  <li>/.cydia_no_stash</li>
  <li>/var/log/jailbreakd-stdout.log</li>
  <li>/etc/motd</li>
  <li>/usr/lib/libsubstitute.dylib</li>
  <li>/var/tmp/slide.txt</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="second-list">Second list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Ghay</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Snapchat.crc</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/embedded.mobileprovision</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="last-one-and-expected-to-exist">Last one (and expected to exist)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/PlugIns</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one makes it a bit harder to fix, since you can not simply replace the arm instructions with something that makes it always return false. Thus requiring an inline hook as replacement for the syscall so you gain full control over it.</p>

<h3 id="obj-c---class-checks">Obj-C - Class checks</h3>

<p>A lot of classes are checked from a lot of different tweaks. This is done using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCOthmanPrefs</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOthmanSnapSaver</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOFiltersOthman</code></li>
  <li><code>SCSnapchPrefs</code></li>

  <li><code>PHMainSettingsVC</code></li>
  <li><code>SCPPrivacySettings</code></li>
  <li><code>SCPSettings</code></li>
  <li><code>SCPSavedMediaSettings</code></li>
  <li><code>SNAPCHAT_SCPSnapUsageSettings</code></li>

  <li><code>yytp</code></li>
  <li><code>FLManager</code></li>
  <li><code>DecryptScriptAlertView</code></li>
  <li><code>DzAdsManager</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-checks">Obj-C - Method checks</h3>

<p>They also check methods. This happens using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a> and then <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418530-class_getinstancemethod">class_getInstanceMethod</a>. If any exists, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NSMutableString</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>a</code></li>
      <li><code>b</code></li>
      <li><code>c</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MZ42SGH98C:</code></li>
    </ul>

  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>saveButtonPressed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>UIViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>dzDidTapGalleryButton</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-integrity-checks">Obj-C - Method integrity checks</h3>

<p>Next up is Snapchats own methods. For the classes listed below they first call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418490-class_copymethodlist">class_copyMethodList</a>. Then for every <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/method?language=objc">Method</a> they check if the <code>IMP</code> pointer (address of the function) is within its own <code>__text</code> segment. This is how they detect whether a method has been hooked.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code></li>
  <li><code>MainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatViewControllerV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCScreenshotDetector</code></li>
  <li><code>SCBaseMediaOperaPresenter</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCLoginService</code></li>
  <li><code>SCAdsHoldoutExperimentContext</code></li>
  <li><code>SCExperimentManager</code></li>
  <li><code>SCCaptionDefaultTextView</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatTypingHandler</code></li>
  <li><code>Story</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMessageV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaViewersLayer</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <code>dzan</code> for telling me to check the <code>__text</code> segment. :-)</p>

<h3 id="symbol-checks">Symbol checks</h3>

<p>They also check for a couple of symbols using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a>. If the result is not null, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MSHookMessageEx</code></li>
  <li><code>MSHookFunction</code></li>
  <li><code>_Z17replaced_readlinkPKcPcm</code></li>
  <li><code>hooksArray</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_METACLASS_$__xxx</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_CLASS_$_PHSSaverV2</code></li>
  <li><code>plist</code></li>
  <li><code>flexBreakPoint</code></li>
  <li><code>convert_coordinates_from_device_to_interface</code></li>
  <li><code>OBJC_METACLASS_$_DzSnapHelper</code></li>
  <li><code>ChKey2</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbol-hook-checks">Symbol hook checks</h3>

<p>A few symbols are resolved using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a> to check whether they have been hooked. They first resolve <code>dlsym</code> using <code>dlsym</code>.. yeah.. That result gets used for the <code>dlsym</code> of the symbols below. For every address returned, the first 4 bytes are checked for common hook related instructions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>dlsym</code></li>
  <li><code>objc_getClass</code></li>
  <li><code>class_getInstanceMethod</code></li>
  <li><code>sel_registerName</code></li>
  <li><code>class_copyMethodList</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_image_count</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_get_image_header</code></li>
  <li><code>dladdr</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h3>

<p>I need to be honest, this is a very annoying way how they check for injection because it is annoying to fix. Instead of using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a> they use the <a href="http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=posix/environ.c">environ</a> variable. Since it is a variable, you can not “hook” it.</p>

<p>At least the following variables are detected.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/TweakInject.dylib</code></li>
  <li><code>_MSSafeMode=0</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sandbox-check">Sandbox check</h3>

<p>Probably not an issue for anyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_sandbox.png" alt="iOS sandbox">
</p>

<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>Not much detection done here but still relevant, using <code>sys_sysctl(202)</code> they request at least the following properties.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kern.version</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.osversion</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.proc.pid.&lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>hw.machine</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>The syscall <code>sys_proc_info(33)</code> is also called a couple of times, which could reveal stuff that is ptracing the process. They also use <code>sys_open(5)</code>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>, <code>sys_close(6)</code> and <code>sys_lstat64(340)</code> on the <code>Snapchat</code> binary. Probably to check for modifications or generating a checksum.</p>

<h2 id="how-all-this-stuff-was-found">How all this stuff was found</h2>

<p>A lot of the work was done using a small iOS emulator build on top of <a href="https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn">Unicorn</a>. Using an emulator you can see everything they do. Building this was also teached me a lot about the CoreFoundation library of iOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_emulator.png" alt="iOS emulator">
</p>

<p>Later I implemented a counter for all of my discoveries in a tweak called <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> while carefully keeping track of how my changes modified the detection flags and slowly getting rid of all of them. You can easily find fixes for checks mentioned in this blog post in the “Detections” directory.</p>

<p>You could alternatively trace the syscalls using any of the methods discussed in the WhoYouGonnaSyscall talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/hexploitable">Hexploitable</a>. Slides of the talk can be found <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2con2019/blob/master/talks/WhoYouGonnaSyscall/Hex-r2con2019-WhoYouGonnaSyscall.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-story-on-how-i-wasted-hours-on-fixing-syscalls">A story on how I wasted hours on fixing syscalls</h3>

<p>Let’s take <code>sys_access(33)</code> as an example. It’s implementation looks like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html">this</a>. In short, when a file exists and permission is granted, return <code>0</code>. Otherwise return <code>-1</code>. First thing I did was force both of the results in my emulator but I saw no changes happening to the detection flags.</p>

<p>Later when implementing a fix for this in the <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> tweak, I was unable to have it fail. The arm instructions look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MOV             X0, X27 ; path
MOV             X1, #0  ; mode
MOV             X16, #0x21
SVC             0x80    ; SYS_access
MOV             X0, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
CSEL            X0, X0, XZR, CS
MOV             X27, X0 ; Use result
</code></pre></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I was recently asked to look over some CVs. It’s a while since I’ve done this, so I thought that noting down my immediate reactions as I went through the CVs might help anyone having to circulate their own CV at the moment.</p>

<!--snip-->

<p><img src="https://youknowfordevs.com/images/uploads/christopher-sardegna-iRyGmA_no2Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Photo by Christopher Sardegna on Unsplash"></p>

<p>I’m not for a moment saying I’m right or wrong in the following views, and this is definitely not one of those posts about ‘how to write your CV to land your dream job’. I’m merely laying out the responses I had and more importantly what I felt these reponses told me about the person behind the CV. My ‘gut reaction’ may well be similar to others’ and if they are, it might be worth bearing them in mind when you share your CV.</p>

<h2 id="looks-count-more-than-i-thought">Looks Count More Than I Thought</h2>

<p>First, it wasn’t until I reached the ninth CV that I realised how much a CV’s appearance makes a difference. When viewing numbers one to eight I hadn’t been thinking ‘these look terrible’, but when I reached the ninth, a part of my brain said: ‘Finally! A CV that looks good.’</p>

<p>I think if the role was for a C++ programmer then I probably would have simply smiled to myself, ignored my response, and moved on. That’s not to say that appearance doesn’t matter–or that C++ programmers don’t worry about their appearance–but if I was trying to decide between two C++ programmers it wouldn’t be the look of their CV that was the deciding factor.</p>

<p>But the role for which I was reviewing this batch of CVs was a React developer and there are lots of very talented React developers out there. And when lots of people have worked with GraphQL and Docker and cloud services and D3 then it may well come down to whether or not you have made an effort to convey that you like things to ‘look nice’.</p>

<p>It’s worth saying too that the CVs that looked good didn’t go overboard; all they did was have a pleasing font, perhaps two columns instead of one for the layout, maybe a couple of icons and some colour, and probably didn’t span more than a couple of pages. But that was enough to convince me that these were people who would ensure that a bad-looking product didn’t get deployed.</p>

<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h2>

<p>Probably in the same vein, typos really jump out at you when you are looking at a lot of CVs. Again I’m not saying I’m right or wrong on whether this should be an important criteria, but the fact that my subconcscious reaction was to be turned off if I saw a spelling mistake–or a technology name that had been capitalised incorrectly–shows that somewhere in our psyches this stuff counts for something.</p>

<p>As with the previous point about looks, I’d probably see this as more relevant for front-end people.</p>

<p>And it might be worth saying that it’s usually not difficult to differentiate between those who have just not bothered to check their CV and those that have difficulty with spelling. I’ve worked with people in the latter camp, both senior managers and junior programmers, and it’s not a big deal–you can work with it and it would not stop me from hiring someone.</p>

<p>But to keep with the theme of my ‘initial reaction’, I can’t help that when I see someone write ‘Graphql’ I’m going to doubt whether the applicant really has that much experience with ‘GraphQL’; maybe it’s worth just double-checking the website of the technologies you use one last time, before sending off that CV.</p>

<h2 id="approaches-v-technologies">Approaches v. Technologies</h2>

<p>One other thing that I hadn’t expected was that I was drawn to mark people more highly if they gave some indication of the <em>approach</em> they took to their coding and development. For example, a few people mentioned having experience with TDD, which I thought was good. That doesn’t mean I’d rule out someone who didn’t have TDD experience, but it’s an approach that people need to be aware of.</p>

<p>However, more importantly than TDD, only a handful indicated that they liked to get involved in code reviews and saw them as a good way to share knowledge and build a consistent and high quality codebase. Again, I would not rule out someone who didn’t mention code reviews, mentoring, and so on, provided they were relatively inexperienced; but I probably <em>would</em> rule out someone who clearly has experience, but hasn’t thought to mention these things.</p>

<h3 id="approach-from-technologies">Approach From Technologies</h3>

<p>What I was also surprised by was how the list of technologies on a person’s CV led to me forming an impression of the kind of coder that person was. If I saw GraphQL in the mix then I found myself thinking ‘modern tech stack’. It may be unfair, especially since GraphQL wasn’t mentioned in the job description that was circulated; but after reviewing all of the CVs I found that it was a pretty accurate indicator of the types of projects someone had been involved in.</p>

<p>There were other technologies that were similarly indicative, such as mention of ‘microservices’, or use of MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on. But there were very few CVs where these technologies appeared without GraphQL.</p>

<p>There is probably no general rule here, since the technologies that differentiate will be different in each cohort of CVs; if every CV included GraphQL then it may have been the presence of something like Docker and/or Kubernetes that told you something about the kind of people you were looking at.</p>

<h2 id="public-profile">Public Profile</h2>

<p>This last point may also be controversial, but I’m going to describe it so that you can do whatever you like with the information; if someone was not on LinkedIn or didn’t have a public Git account, I found myself thinking ‘well, what exactly do they do?’</p>

<p>From this batch of 22 CVs, only one had answered any questions on Stack Overflow, and only one–a different person–had done any talks at Meetups. A couple had GitHub accounts, a couple were on LinkedIn and a couple had blogs.</p>

<p>This is no doubt unfair, so again, blame my subconscious. But I can’t help think that if I’m going to work with some people day after day, I want to be with people that are sharing links to things they’ve read, people who are trying out new technologies and languages, people who have weekend projects, or who are contributing bug fixes back to open source projects.</p>

<p>And although I’m not particularly a big fan of LinkedIn, I always quite like it when I see people who are at the early stages of their career making connections with everyone they met at last night’s Meetup.</p>

<p>None of this is to ignore the current discussion about work/life balance–to demand that people do their own education in their own time, spend all waking hours coding, attend Meetups every night of the week. But it is to recognise that we are in a fast-moving industry, and if you want your CV to be picked from amongst that batch of 22, then it’s going to be important to think about how you come across.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>One final thing has just occurred to me…I didn’t consider the qualifications of <em>anyone</em>, which I imagine is down to the role that the CVs were for. You’d certainly be interested in degrees and PhDs if you were hiring a data scientist or someone to write an operating system; in these spaces theory is a major element. But for fast-moving technologies like front-end development, you can probably tell everything about a person from their experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I haven’t had to look at CVs for quite a while, so it was interesting to examine my own responses to reviewing this batch. What became clear is that I quickly ‘merged’ the CV and the person in my mind. If there were mistakes in the CV I couldn’t help but imagine someone who lacked attention to detail. If there was a little bit of colour in the CV or the person had spoken at a Meetup then I couldn’t help but think that this was a person who was prepared to go the extra mile. And if the person had a public Git account then my spontaneous reaction was that this was someone who wanted to keep learning, and really enjoyed the work they do.</p>

<p>I may be wrong in my judgements or harsh in my conclusions, but if you’re about to send your CV out, at least you now have a couple more insights that might help you decide how your CV is representing you.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.
</p>
<h4><span>1.1</span> <a id="x1-20001.1"></a>Defining the problem</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p>Formally speaking, we first test the following hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 287--><dl><dt>
<span>H1</span></dt><dd>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences can be found in acceptable time.</dd></dl>
                                                                            
                                                                            
<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.
</p><!--l. 300--><p>The complete set of minimum cost repair sequences makes it more likely that the programmer
will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:
</p><!--l. 315--><dl><dt>
<span>H2</span></dt><dd>Ranking the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue locally reduces the global cascading error problem.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 321--><p>We also strongly validate this hypothesis. We do this by comparing ‘normal’ <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> with a
simple variant <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span><span>rev</span> which reverses the ranking process, always selecting from amongst the
worst …</p></div></div>

    <p>
      Symbolic execution with SymCC: Don't interpret, compile!
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the 29th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 20),
    Boston, MA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      A major impediment to practical symbolic execution is speed, especially
      when compared to near-native speed solutions like fuzz testing. We propose
      a compilation-based approach to symbolic execution that performs better
      than state-of-the-art implementations by orders of magnitude. We present
      SymCC, an LLVM-based C and C++ compiler that builds concolic execution
      right into the binary. It can be used by software developers as a drop-in
      replacement for <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>clang++</tt>, and we show how to
      add support for other languages with little effort. In comparison with
      KLEE, SymCC is faster by up to three orders of magnitude and an average
      factor of 12. It also outperforms QSYM, a system that recently showed
      great performance improvements over other implementations, by up to two
      orders of magnitude and an average factor of 10. Using it on real-world
      software, we found that our approach consistently achieves higher
      coverage, and we discovered two vulnerabilities in the heavily tested
      OpenJPEG project, which have been confirmed by the project maintainers and
      assigned CVE identifiers.

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is a fast compiler-based symbolic execution engine. On this page, we
    provide SymCC's source code, the raw results of the experiments described in
    the paper, as well as instructions how you can replicate those experiments
    yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symcc">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe two sets of experiments: we first benchmark SymCC
    on the CGC programs, then we run it on real-world software. This section
    describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides links to our
    results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        CGC experiments (our results
        for <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_pure_time.csv">pure
        execution
        time</a>, <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_time.csv">concolic
        execution time</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_coverage.tar.gz">coverage</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We used the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios">Linux
          port</a> of the CGC programs by Trail of Bits. SymCC needs to be built
        with support for 32-bit compilation (see <tt>docs/32-bit.txt</tt>;
        this is not part of the Dockerfile because it would double the build
        time of the container while providing value to just a few users). Then
        you can simply export
        <tt>CC=/path/to/symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=/path/to/sym++</tt> and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, and
        build the CGC programs as usual (i.e., by invoking their build.sh script).
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the programs on the raw PoV inputs
        with <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt> to measure pure execution
        time, and unset the environment variable for symbolic execution. To
        assess coverage, we ran <tt>afl-showmap</tt> with the
        AFL-instrumented CGC programs on each generated input and accumulated
        the resulting coverage maps per program, resulting in a set of covered
        map entries for each CGC program. The sizes of those sets can then be
        fed to the scoring formula presented in the paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        For KLEE and QSYM, we used the setup
        described <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/ir_study.html">here</a> but with the regular 32-bit
        binaries built by cb-multios.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        The analysis of real-world software always follows the same procedure.
        Assuming you have exported <tt>CC=symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=sym++</tt>
        and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, first download the code,
        then build it using its own build system, finally
        unset <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT</tt> and analyze the program in
        concert with AFL (which requires building a second time for AFL,
        see <tt>docs/Fuzzing.txt</tt>). We used AFL 2.56b and built the
        targets with <tt>AFL_USE_ASAN=1</tt>. Note that the fuzzing helper
        is already installed in the Docker container.

          analyzed <tt>bin/bsdtar tf @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a
          single dummy file containing the character "A".
        </li>

        <li>
          tcpdump
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_tcpdump.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we built both tcpdump and libpcap; in order to make the
          former find the latter, just place the source directories next to each
          other in the same folder. We used revision <tt>d615abec</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git">libpcap</a>
          and revision <tt>d57927e1</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump.git">tcpdump</a>.
          We built first libpcap and then tcpdump with <tt>./configure
          &amp;&amp; make</tt>, and analyzed
          <tt>tcpdump/tcpdump -e -r @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a single dummy
          file containing the character "A".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All experiments used one AFL master process, one secondary AFL process,
        and one SymCC process. We let them run for 24 hours and repeated each of
        them 30 times to create the graphs in the paper; AFL map density was
        extracted from the secondary AFL process' <tt>plot_data</tt> file,
        column <tt>map_size</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The QSYM experiments used an analogous setup, replacing SymCC with QSYM
        and running it with AFL according to the QSYM
        authors' <a href="https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym#run-hybrid-fuzzing-with-afl">instructions</a>.

<![CDATA[More Testing Terminology]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is mostly copypasta from <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/412281/112115">an answer I gave on StackOverflow</a> about how to avoid mocks when unit testing. It’s a continuation of the argument I gave in <a href="http://chriswarbo.net/blog/2017-11-10-unit_testing_terminology.html">an earlier blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I think the subject of automated testing suffers from conflated and co-opted terminology, which causes people to talk past each other.</p>
<p>For example, the questioner asks the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should I be writing only integration tests when there is dependency, and unit tests for pieces of code without any dependency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think most people would answer this question by saying something like (ideally, modulo common sense, etc.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is no dependency, unit tests are sufficient and mocks aren’t needed; when there is dependency, unit tests may need mocks and there should also be integration tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s call this Answer A, and I’m going to assume that it’s a relatively uncontroversial thing to say.</p>
<p>However, two people might both give Answer A, but mean very different things when they say it!</p>
<p>When a person who the questioner terms a “classicist” says Answer A, they might mean the following (Answer B):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functionality that is internal to the application (e.g.&nbsp;a calculation which performs no I/O) doesn’t need integration tests, and its unit tests don’t need mocks. Functionality with some external dependency (e.g.&nbsp;a separate application like an RDBMS, or a third-party Web service) should have integration tests, and if it has unit tests they may need the external interactions to be mocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When others (let’s call them “mockists”) say Answer A, the might mean the following (Answer C):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class which doesn’t call methods of another class doesn’t need integration tests, and its unit tests don’t need mocks. Classes which call methods of other classes should mock those out during their unit tests, and they should probably have integration tests too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These testing strategies are objectively very different, but they both correspond to Answer A. This is due to the different meanings they are using for words. We can caricature someone who says Answer A, but means Answer B, as saying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “dependency” is a different application, Web service, etc. Possibly maintained by a third-party. Unchangeable, at least within the scope of our project. For example, our application might have MySQL as a dependency.</li>
<li>A “unit” is a piece of functionality which makes some sort of sense on its own. For example “adding a contact” may be a unit of functionality.</li>
<li>A “unit test” checks some aspect of a unit of functionality. For example, “if we add a contact with email address X, looking up that contact’s email address should give back X”.</li>
<li>An “interface” is the protocol our application should follow to interact with a dependency, or how our application should behave when used as a dependency by something else. For example, SQL with a certain schema when talking to a database; JSON with a certain schema, sent over HTTP, when talking to a ReST API.</li>
<li>An “integration test” checks that the interface our application is using with a dependency will actually have the desired effect. For example “There will always be exactly one matching row after running an UPSERT query”.</li>
<li>A “mock” is a simplified, in-memory alternative to a dependency. For example, <code>MockRedisConnection</code> may follow the same interface as <code>RedisConnection</code>, but just contains a <code>HashMap</code>. Mocks can sometimes be useful, e.g.&nbsp;if some of our unit tests are annoyingly slow, or if our monthly bill from a third-party Web service is too high due to all of the calls made by our tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can caricature someone who says Answer A, but means Answer C, as saying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “dependency” is a different class to the one we’re looking at. For example, if we’re looking at the <code>Invoice</code> class, then the <code>Product</code> class might be a dependency.</li>
<li>A “unit” is a chunk of code, usually a method or class. For example <code>User::addContact</code> may be a unit.</li>
<li>A “unit test” checks only the code inside a single unit (e.g.&nbsp;one class). For example “Calling <code>User::addContact</code> with a contact with email address X will ask the <code>DBConnection</code> to insert a contacts row containing email address X”.</li>
<li>An “interface” is like a class but only has the method names and types; the implementations are provided by each class extending that interface.</li>
<li>An “integration test” checks that code involving multiple classes gives the correct result. For example “Adding a <code>Discount</code> to a <code>ShoppingCart</code> affects the <code>Invoice</code> produced by the <code>Checkout</code>”.</li>
<li>A “mock” is an object which records the method calls made on it, so we can check what the unit of code we’re testing tried to do in a unit test. They are essential if we want to isolate the unit under test from every other class.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are very different meanings, but the relationships between B’s meanings and between C’s meanings are similar, which is why both groups of people seem to agree with each other about Answer A (e.g.&nbsp;their definitions of “dependency” and “integration test” differ, but both have the relationship “dependencies should have integration tests”).</p>
<p>For the record, I would personally count myself as what that questioner calls a “classicist” (although I’d not come across that term before); hence why the above caricatures are clearly biased!</p>
<p>In any case, I think this problem of conflated meanings needs to be addressed before we can have constructive debates about the merits of one approach versus another. Unfortunately every time someone tries to introduce some new, more specialised vocabulary to avoid the existing conflations, those terms start getting mis-used until they’re just as conflated as before.</p>
<p>For example, “Thought Leader X” might want to talk about physical humans clicking on a UI or typing in a CLI, so they say “it’s important to describe how users can interact with the system; we’ll call these ‘behaviours’”. Their terminology spreads around, and soon enough “Though Leader Y” (either through misunderstanding, or thinking they’re improving the situation), will say something like “I agree with X, that when we design a system like the <code>WidgetFactory</code> class, we should use behaviours to describe how it interacts with its users, like the <code>ValidationFactory</code> class”. This co-opted usage spreads around, obscuring the original meaning. Those reading old books and blog posts from X may get confused about the original message, and start applying their advice to the newer meanings (after all, this is a highly regarded book by that influential luminary X!).</p>
<p>We’ve now reached the situation where “module” means class, “entity” means class, “unit” means class, “collaborator” means class, “dependency” means class, “user” means class, “consumer” means class, “client” means class, “system under test” means class, “service” means class. Where “boundary” means “class boundary”, “external” means “class boundary”, “interface” means “class boundary”, “protocol” means “class boundary”. Where “behaviour” means “method call”, where “functionality” means “method call”, where “message send” means “method call”…</p>

            <p>I was always a fan of the steampunk style, and having also had experience building steam engines in the past, there was only one real direction this project could go. Once I had my radiation detector kit hooked up to my Raspberry Pi running InfluxDB and Grafana, I found myself woodworking, machining, and fabricobbling an enclosure out of mahogany, brass, copper, toggle switches and, because it just had to be done, nixie tubes.</p>

<p>Read the story of the almost year-long journey (<em>cough</em> some other stuff cropped up…) I went on to make my steampunk vision a reality below, and if you want to get up and running quickly, find out how to <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/">build your own simple version right here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introductionspanidintrospan">Introduction <span id="intro"></span></h2>

<p>Low cost radiation monitors and Geiger counter kits have been available online for around $30-50US/£25-45 for a while, but standing alone they don’t do much other than make the recognizable “clicking” sound we all know from movies and TV. I decided to up the ante by connecting one to a Raspberry Pi, storing the data with InfluxDB, and showing the readings with a Grafana dashboard.</p>



<p>I updated the tech, gave it a web interface, added remote management, and built a custom mahogany housing with brass and copper fittings to show everything off, because it’s important to look suitably <em>hip</em> when sitting on the desk next to your <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-train-station-oled-sign-for-your-desk/">train sign</a>… right?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/header.jpg" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(58)">  
</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m gonna show what I built to hopefully provide some inspiration, then show you how to get up and running with a simpler version of the project that anyone can build at home without any special tools. Let’s hit this.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="inspirationdesignspanidinspirationspan">Inspiration &amp; design <span id="inspiration"></span></h2>

<p>I’ve always found the idea of radiation fascinating; how there are invisible particles moving around at incredibly high speeds, crashing into things and flipping bits all around us. Due to my fascination, it doesn’t take a lot to capture my interest when it comes to this field.</p>

<p>One day last year I was reminiscing over the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44606771">now defunct</a> UK-based electronics retailer Maplin, and how they sold all sorts of interesting kits for the aspiring engineer. This led me to <a href="https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2019/09/maplin-geiger-counter/">Richard Mudhar’s blog</a> where he tells the story of the <em>Maplin Geiger Counter</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/mudhar-example.png" alt="An excerpt and image from Richard Mudhar's post"></p>

</figure>

<p>The kit that Richard has built above features both an electromechanical counter on the left, and two rings of LEDs reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron">dekatron tubes</a> on the right. This display has the neat design feature that as the rate of count increases, the display becomes more noticeable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/dekatron.gif" alt=""></p>

</figure>

<p>I liked the idea of combining the modern technology on the inside (Raspberry Pi, Grafana, etc.) with the timeless look of brass, copper, toggle switches, dark hardwood, and glass on the outside. The idea was now to build something that looked old and had that distinctive steampunk style, but was up to date and Internet-connected.</p>

<p>In addition to the total absolute count like the old Maplin counter, I wanted to offer a live display of the counts per minute (CPM) reading, and what better way to do this than with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tubes</a>, to get that nice warm orange glow and keep things looking cosy.</p>

<p>I started scribbling down ideas and thoughts of materials I wanted to use alongside shopping lists for parts, and possible designs for the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/notes.jpg" alt="Original shop notes!"></p>

<figure>  
Notes don’t survive well in a machine shop, but these are what’s left of my original sketches.  
</figure>

<p>This process was very much led by an image I had in my mind about how the thing should look and feel and so I just had to make it real… somehow.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="thebuildspanidbuildspan">The build <span id="build"></span></h2>

<p>With some thoughts and ideas scribbled down it was time to get started. As this is for the most part going to be a bespoke, hand-built item, and made up as I go along, it’s not necessary to put everything in CAD. There are of course some core items that exist already and cannot change size; the Raspberry Pi and radiation detector board, for example. These are off-the-shelf parts that have to fit in the box no matter what, and start to dictate the size of the final unit.</p>

<p>Almost all other parts are completely hand made, machined and fabricated. This was necessitated by the desire to make everything authentic; I didn’t want to build things just for looks, I wanted any design choices made for aesthetic reasons to also be functional; by this I mean when I put 18 screws in something to make it look good, they are going to be 18 <em>real</em> screws that you have to take out to gain access!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each of the build log images link to a separate gallery when clicked. You can look through the images that way if you prefer, or read on in full detail.</p>

<h3 id="thefrontpanelspanidpanelspan">The front panel <span id="panel"></span></h3>

<p>I started with the front panel of the housing, I knew I wanted two toggle switches; one for power and one for sound (to disable the clicking noise), along with 3 nixie tubes to display the CPM up to 999. Normal background radiation is in the range of about 25-75 CPM, so I figured if background radiation is above 999 CPM, we have bigger problems than worrying about enough digits on the counter.</p>



<p>The two front panel pieces are made from 6mm thick mild steel plate, cut to size with an angle grinder and then milled to dimension with the help of Bridget, the Bridgeport. Holes are then cut for the nixies and the toggle switches.</p>



<p>I manufactured labels for each by hand-punching lettering into 0.5mm thick brass sheet, polishing and fixing with M2 screws. The steel pieces are coated with a clear lacquer to prevent corrosion.</p>

<h3 id="workingwithwoodspanidwoodspan">Working with wood <span id="wood"></span></h3>

<p>Wood isn’t my favourite material to work with, I mean it just changes shape of its own accord! Who can work with that?! Anyhow, it’s very pretty, and so it was decided that the outer box should be made of hardwood. I started with a scrap piece of mahogany, cut it to halve the thickness on the bandsaw, and then set about planing and shaping the sides of the box to fit the dimensions of the Raspberry Pi (3A+) and the radiation detector.</p>



<p>The dimensions of the front panel along with the steel faceplates were planned out in Fusion 360 so that I could print a cutting and drilling template. This was taped onto the planed piece of mahogany, the holes for screws were drilled, and the openings for components cut out.</p>



<p>The pieces were cut at 45 degree angles to enable a mitre joint in each corner. The joints were reinforced with biscuits (mmm biscuits), and then the 4 sides were glued and clamped and allowed to cure overnight.</p>



<p>The top and bottom of the case are made from the same scrap mahogany, but planed a lot thinner - approximately 6mm, the same as the steel plate.</p>

<h3 id="topbrassspanidbrassspan">Top brass <span id="brass"></span></h3>

<p>I had the idea that it would look good to hold the box together with a totally unnecessary amount of screws, 36 to be exact; 18 on top and 18 on the bottom. To prevent the screws damaging the wood surface and to add some extra detail to the top of the case I decided to make a brass plate that the screws all go through to clamp the top cover down.</p>



<p>Some pieces of 2mm brass strip were cut, mitred on the corners and soldered together. Once soldered, sanded and polished, the joints are barely visible.</p>



<p>Holes for screws were then drilled, and the brass plate used to secure the oversize lid to the box whilst it was sanded to size on a drum sander. I later learned that using a drum sander for this was a mistake as it marked the sides of the box, but you live and learn!</p>

<h3 id="imitationdekatronsspaniddekatronsspan">Imitation Dekatrons <span id="dekatrons"></span></h3>

<p>My attempt at imitating the Dekatron tube effect starts with a piece of 50mm stainless steel (or aluminium) bar. The bar is turned on a lathe down to 40mm, and to have a cavity for the electronics. The work is removed from the lathe and parted off on a bandsaw before being returned to the lathe to have a hole drilled in the rear for cabling to drive the LEDs.</p>



<p>The part is then put on the milling machine to have 10 holes drilled and M2 <del>taps snapped off in the holes</del> threaded ready to fasten the faceplate.</p>



<p>The brass faceplate is made from the same 0.5mm thick brass sheet as the labels from the faceplates. Each piece is drilled with 20 holes (10 for LEDs, 10 for fasteners), and then hand stamped with the numbering for each LED.</p>

<p>The LEDs are wired with a common ground and connected using a piece of recycled floppy disk drive ribbon cable. All the work is then carried out a second time for the ‘X10’ display. The eagle-eyed readers will notice that the second display is made from a different material than the first - this is due to the fact I snapped both a drill bit and a tap off in the M2 holes - working with stainless steel with these small tools is very difficult! I ended up making the second from aluminium, which machines like butter, in comparison.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this project I found myself continually swapping fasteners and trying different combinations to see what looks best. The end result is a mix of M2 and M3 metric machine screws in both brass and stainless steel, cheese head and countersunk head, all slotted. You may notice that in earlier photos some of the parts were assembled with Allen-head cap screws but these were later swapped out. Ebay is usually a great place to get small quantities of fasteners of all different shapes and sizes.</p>

    <p>This piece is an introduction a new series—called <em>Unitaskers</em>—that will feature single-purpose artifacts that let you do one thing.</p>
<p>Think, for instance, of a graphite pencil. It's useful to write or draw. You can sharpen it to get thin lines or tilt it to get thicker, faded strokes. You can write a letter or draw a house. You can trace continuous lines or do pointillism. But there isn't much more you can do with it.</p>
<p>In the opposite spectrum are your computer or your smartphone—they can virtually do anything, from drawing and writing to setting an alarm, sending emails, but they make doing something with focus harder than ever before.</p>
<p>How does your thought process change when you write with pencil and paper instead of typing on your laptop? When you read a book on Kindle instead of reading on your tablet? When you capture audio notes with a hand-recorder instead of using your phone?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Each essay of the series will use an object (or family of objects) as a source of inspirations to share stories and facts around finding focus in our age of distraction.</p>

A Look at Bullies in Tech

<p>Goodness. The tech world must be really unfriendly, or alternatively I must be the absolute scum of the planet. Let's figure out what I did.</p>
<h2 id="indirection_is_not_abstraction">Indirection Is Not Abstraction</h2>
<p>Back in December of 2012, <a href="http://twitter.com/zedshaw" title="">Zed Shaw</a> wrote an essay entitled <a href="http://zedshaw.com/essays/indirection_is_not_abstraction.html" title="">Indirection Is Not Abstraction</a> (if link is <a href="https://wilkie.how/shaw_indirection.txt" title="">broken</a>). In this, Shaw notes that there are a few misconceptions about the definitions of several terms used to describe methods of modular design and code isolation: interfaces, abstractions, and indirection. Basically, he suggests that our fellow coders and engineers mix them up and conflate them with other concepts.</p>

<p>The article is clearly a bit of a work in progress, as noted by Shaw himself in the concluding paragraph. It is not particularly well-written or well-structured. Shaw uses a writing style that conjures this image of the ever irritating shock-jock. If there is something he doesn't like, he emphasizes with expletives. If there is <em>someone</em> he doesn't like, he will go out of his way to find the room to take a shot at them. For instance, later on, Zed Shaw manages to inexplicably slip in a link to a search for <em>"Dave Winer Asshole."</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s even worse
when the implementer realizes that if he implements the most complicated piece
of shit possible then he can go rogue consultant and make tons of mad cash
helping poor unsuspecting companies implement his steaming pile of bullshit.
Harsh words? You bet. But I’m fed up with people imposing their faulty
definitions and ideas on me without any way for me to easily fight back with a
reasonable explanation as to why their crap is steaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writing style is difficult to parse and makes the reader wonder how concise the article could be if such filler was removed. For instance, the paragraph above provides the motivation for the piece. You might believe, only knowing the intent of the article, that the motivation would be to provide a better structure for discussing modular design. However, Zed Shaw's stream of consciousness relays a motivation to provide a better means for him to tell you (male implementors, not women apparently) that your code is similar to excrement wasting away in the sunlight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unbelievable 6 levels of indirection just to add a fucking object to a fucking collection. This is the kind of bullshit that chaps my ass purple and makes me want to eat babies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and to prevent him from desiring the consumption of small children in this unbelievably lazy reference found later on. Sigh. People. Look. This isn't hard. Killing a baby is not a valid literary device. It does not invoke peaceful idyllic imagery that helps you make your point through nostalgia. Stop it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Zed Shaw hits some good points and gives some decent ideas about how to better describe what an abstraction is. Of course, this is done in a paragraph that was probably supposed to be a bulleted list because it has a bunch of random asterisks between each sentence, but, as I said, the content in that mess is actually very good. (Hint: he doesn't swear or talk about the color of his butt.)</p>

<p>Now let us focus on how I am involved. I research distributed systems and operating design. The whole indirection, interfaces, and abstractions thing? I'll let you in on a secret... That's what an operating system is. Therefore, I saw the gaps in an unfinished article and figured I had something useful to say. I gave the following post of my own in response to his article on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ja5ihv/indirection_is_not_abstraction/comments/nl5sy4" title="">lobste.rs</a>:</p>

<p><em>"I had no idea the terms were so misused! It’s pretty simple, though. You have interfaces… if the implementations change behind them, that doesn’t mean your interface is flexible. It just means you have essentially a commit history that the interface allows you to ignore. Therefore, interfaces are not abstractions. Java misuses the term ‘abstract,’ because their usage only has meaning at the language parse time where it implies the lack of implementation logic. However, at runtime, an abstract class does not provide an abstraction, but an interface. However, we conflate the term with the notion of usage abstraction.</em></p>

<p><em>"Zed does a terrible job at illustrating a true abstraction. Abstractions take away things. They simplify. They consolidate, perhaps, but they consolidate power through generalization. A programming language is an abstraction of a machine language. A machine language is an interface to the CPU’s control and arithmetic units. A machine language doesn’t abstract because it doesn’t limit.</em></p>

<p><em>"I’ll add that abstractions are generally not machine-driven. They are people-driven. We abstract because some interfaces are too complicated. We abstract with natural language. We want things to be easier for the sake of programmers. A programming language is an abstraction because ‘var i = j + 1’ is so much better than the machine equivalent, however we sacrifice something to do this. That’s generally a good test for determining which something is. API’s are interfaces (yes, duh), Frameworks/languages are abstractions (read as: should be)</em></p>

<p><em>"Zed doesn’t really talk about where the discrepancy comes from (because people are dumb isn’t really good enough.) What really gets people is that interfaces usually have implementations which make use of abstractions. So, this is also a question of scoping. An implementation can make use of an abstraction, however, an interface cannot force the usage of an abstraction (since an interface is just a name and a behavior.) A test for that is whether or not the implementation can eschew the abstraction by reinventing the universe to provide equivalent behavior. But looking at the wrong scope when you design can certainly lead to this problem of term discrepancy."</em></p>
<h2 id="zed_shaw_responds">Zed Shaw Responds</h2>
<p>Apparently the post was well-received enough to catch Zed Shaw's attention, which I suppose was my first mistake.</p>

<p><img src="https://wilkie.how/images/the-zed-shaw-phenomenon/zedshaw_3.png" title="" alt="!zedshaw"></p>

<p>Zed Shaw's response was not a very friendly one. He stripped my handle out of the reply to Steve and gives that common criticism of criticism: <em>"you didn't even read it."</em> Steve did that thing that your friends do when you are out with them and they run into some Cool People, and he started to distance himself from me like it was coincidence that I was in the same room. That was disappointing, but I agree with Steve's careful implication that it is a bit confusing that I could both repeat what Shaw said and yet in the same small post also suggest that he was wrong.</p>

<p>It felt very odd to see this conversation unfold with me as the topic without either giving me an opportunity to contribute. <strong>I felt a bit restrained as I didn't seem to have the authority to defend myself</strong>. Yet, overall I didn't particularly care. <em>"Oh well,"</em> I thought, <em>"I got my Zed-Shaw-Hates-You-Achievement. 10 Points."</em> The thing is, the comment I posted is very on point, which is all that matters when you write. You always anger somebody with your research. There is this expression people like to console you with resembling <em>"if you make people angry, you're doing something right."</em> But, in reality, some people are just really touchy when you are working on a similar project. I'm not sure if it is fear, or related to what territorial dogs do in the park, but it happens.</p>

<p>The important part is that my post is not wrong and I stand by it. The idea that interfaces should be considered first-class over abstractions because abstractions are always summarizations of a set of interfaces is an important idea. One that I believe Zed Shaw didn't really care about, so I made instead. But what if it wasn't me and it was somebody else? There must be others that are completely suppressed by this behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feel free to contact me with comments on this essay. It is still being worked on and is open for review. I’m pretty sure it makes no sense right now, but the major points should be there. I’m especially interested if you have any examples which you find relevant to the discussion, either for or against what I’m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, I have to say; I was scratching my head a bit by his reaction. If he suggests himself that the post makes no sense and that he invites comments including criticism, why was my post so ill-received?</p>
<h2 id="the_bully_mindset">The Bully Mindset</h2>
<p>Zed Shaw insists that I said he is wrong. I did no such thing. I agreed with many of his points. However, if I squint my eyes, I think I can see where that sentiment is coming from: <em>"Zed does a terrible job at illustrating a true abstraction."</em></p>

<p>Why would I use the word <em>terrible</em> ? Because it is true. But I'm not calling him wrong, rather I'm suggesting that the writing quality is poor, because it is. It was an incredible eyesore for one. Also, he illustrates many examples of awful, tedious object hierarchies and gives some decent definitions of the terms, yet, he does not give any examples of what in the real-world actually abides by those definitions. Therefore, I did. I felt that this was the weakest part of the work, and I described it as such.</p>

<p>So wait. Could it be, then, that Zed Shaw is offended by the word <em>terrible</em> ? Could it be that the same person who desires a means to call your code a pile of feces shrieks at such a negative adjective?</p>

<p>Let's catch up to the present. How did this come back up almost 8 months later? Recently Zed Shaw published an <a href="http://xoratelier.com/" title="">idea</a> where people would pay him to work on his projects. Kurtis Rainbolt Greene offered reasonable criticism of the structure of the program. In reply, Zed Shaw spouts a stream of expletives about how absurd Kurtis apparently is to him.</p>

<p>In frustration, Kurtis issues a status about how Zed Shaw attacked rather than reasoned, and I felt the need to express solidarity. This is very much my experience from before where criticism was met with immediate aggression. I tagged Zed's handle (something he didn't afford me.) When Zed replied to me, shocked that I would be so brazen, I pointed out the tweet where he had attacked my post while …</p></div></div></div>

I would even do round trips - fly to London in the morning, attend two client pitches and be back in Prague by night. Using low budget airlines that had frequent delays, I found myself leaving the house before 6 AM and coming back at 1 the next morning. I would work the whole time on the train, at the airport and sometimes even on the cab ride back home. Consequently, my mind was rushing with thoughts and I couldn't fall asleep despite the exhaustion.</p><p>Sometimes, I'd miss my return flight. I'd be forced to stay the night in an airport hotel and show up to work the next day in Prague wearing day old clothes.</p><p>At the same time, we were trying to enter Polish and Romanian markets. Once in a four day span I managed to cover Prague --&gt; London --&gt; Warsaw --&gt; Manchester --&gt; Bucharest --&gt; Prague.

<![CDATA[War Story – hunting down a memory leak in a C++ application]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).

          <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/dial-up/">Dial-Up web site</a> for a listing of the upcoming talks on OpenROAD, cell design, OpenRAM, and Magic, an old, but surprisingly up-to-date tool!

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-datetime.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>Gates was having an informal meeting with Steve Shaiman, a cheerful gnome of a man with a head of frizzy hair who was general manager of Microsoft’s hardware division, and with Raleigh Roark one of the two people who had started the division. They were talking about fonts and applications, especially Word.</p>

<p>Roark gave Gates his answer: For printers, basically. This was the era of desktop publishing and proliferating office applications, and users needed more than just the bitmapped system fonts on their computers to get their work done. Courier, Tms Rmn, and Helv were not going to be enough. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is known for asking hard questions, but also for accepting hard answers and acting on them. As soon as he got his answer, he pointed at Steve and told him: “Now you run type!”</p>

<p>That’s the way things worked at Microsoft in those days, says Shaiman: whoever knew the most about a subject tended to end up in charge of it. So he ended up starting Microsoft’s first fonts group. It was Spring, 1989.</p>

				<h2>The conquest of TrueType</h2>

			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-phone.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN was on a business trip to Atlanta with Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s celebrated head of advanced technology, when they got an unexpected phone call. Myhrvold had with him a satellite phone—an early mobile phone, “which in those days,” as Shaiman put it, “meant something you’d carry in a suitcase.” The unexpected call was from Apple.</p>

<p>At that time, Adobe Systems dominated the digital font market, with its PostScript technology built into Apple’s LaserWriter printers, and with PostScript firmly established as the preferred format for high-quality fonts. Microsoft needed to find its own format and its own fonts if it didn’t want to be dependent on Adobe.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft, Apple was trying to find ways to license the PostScript language from Adobe, or to find an alternative. The Apple call was about font technology: Apple was developing its own font format, TrueType, as an alternative to PostScript, while Microsoft acquired a program called TrueImage, a potential PostScript clone, which Apple was interested in. How about a trade?</p>

<p>Shaiman says that his and Nathan Myhrvold’s reaction was immediate: “Sure!”</p>

<p>Ironically, once Microsoft got hold of TrueType, they loved the concept but didn’t like the way it was implemented. Although they ended up only making slight modifications to the version that shipped with Windows 3.1, when it came time for the next version of Windows, they ended up “throwing out Apple’s code and rewriting it from scratch.”</p>

<p>When Microsoft and Apple publicly announced their collaboration on TrueType at the Seybold conference in September 1989, the announcement was handled in a contentious and aggressive manner that antagonized Adobe and famously brought Adobe’s John Warnock to tears of frustration. Steve Shaiman feels now that it was a poor way to do it: “We couldn’t have done worse.” Although they were demonstrating what they felt was better technology, they made the mistake of shoving it in Adobe’s face. “What we really needed,” he says, “was a good PR person who could have helped us come up with a less aggressive approach.” But the deed was done. The “font wars” were in full swing.</p>

<p>The key developer of Microsoft’s new code was Eliyezer Kohen, whom Myhrvold met at a conference in Switzerland. Eliyezer was, as Steve Shaiman put it, “really, really smart.” He had a PhD from ETH Zurich, where he studied with Hans Eduard Meyer, the designer of the font Syntax, and Niklaus Wirth, designer of the Pascal language; and he developed his own technology for creating scalable fonts. Eliyezer, according to Shaiman, was “a Turkish Jew with a German wife, who wanted to move to the United States, as one or the other of them wasn’t welcome in any country in Europe where they might find decent working conditions.” Microsoft happily brought him in.</p>

				<h2>Even a DOS screen needs a font</h2>

			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-dosscreen.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>GREG HITCHCOCK was one of the early members of what he calls the “virtual team” that Shaiman and Dennis Adler put together in early 1990 to deal with fonts. Hitchcock is tall, blond, and slow-spoken; he doesn’t fit the image of the high-energy Microsoft employee, and he may seem unassertive, almost tentative, if you see him only in a neutral context. But when you see his attention snap to the subjects he knows and cares about, he is forceful and precise, and very, very knowledgeable. His memory is encyclopedic, and he has been at the heart of Microsoft’s typographic development for more than a quarter century. Today he manages Microsoft’s Advanced Reading Technologies (ART) team.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft had been dealing with fonts in one way or another from the very beginning (even a DOS screen needs a font to display its text), Hitchcock feels that the story of typography at Microsoft really begins here: When the first outline fonts were created for Windows 3.1, in 1990.</p>

<p>It was all brand-new technology. All fonts up until then had been bitmap fonts, crude forms made up of coarse screen pixels in a vague approximation of what real letters looked like. Although Microsoft’s new effort was driven by purely practical needs—mapping the screen fonts on a computer system to the fonts available on a printer—Hitchcock feels that it was also the beginning of thinking about screen fonts as something useful and readable in themselves.</p>

<p>The members of the virtual team came from all over Microsoft: Dennis Adler (Fonts), Jean-François Peyroux (OS/2, and later Windows), Michel Suignard (Windows International), Greg Hitchcock (OS/2), Eliyezer Kohen (Fonts), David Weise (Windows), Tim McCaffery (Windows), Raleigh Roark (Hardware), Gabe Newell (Printing), and later Ben Bauermeister, an outside consultant, whose “PANOSE system” for classifying typefaces by their visual characteristics (rather than their historical roots) might provide a roadmap between screen and print.</p>

				<h2>Monotype send out S.O.S.</h2>

			<section data-blockname="body_copy">
				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-shake.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN hired Dennis Adler to manage the fonts groups.&nbsp; Together, they talked with several potential sources of font libraries and font technologies, including most of the big guns in the field. Linotype, the venerable manufacturer of hot-metal typesetting equipment, which owned the rights to, among others, the very popular typeface Helvetica, was being hard-nosed. “Fonts were seen as incredibly valuable at the time,” says Shaiman, “and Linotype’s attitude was, ‘What’s Microsoft going to do for us?’” So they were asking an enormous price for licensing the fonts. And Microsoft didn’t want to license the fonts; it wanted to own the rights. (When Shaiman told me this, he laughed and proclaimed: “Microsoft doesn’t rent things!”)</p>

<p>Monotype, on the other hand, was much more receptive. Monotype was Linotype’s great rival; between them, the two companies had essentially created the business of mechanical typesetting in the late 19th century, with their competing hot-metal composition machines. But the Monotype Corporation had fallen on hard times. The typography division, the only part of the company working on digital fonts, was making money, but the larger machinery business was hemorrhaging cash, and the parent company was about to declare bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Out of that debacle rose a new type-only company, Monotype Typography Ltd, which was essentially the old typography division reconstituted as an independent business.</p>

<p>The new company, with its focus on digital fonts and information technology, was headed by a German, Rene Kerfante, who had joined Monotype in 1987 to head up the typography division, and an American, Ira Mirochnik, who had been Monotype’s chief financial officer. They were both quite ready to negotiate a deal with Microsoft.</p>

<p>So it was Monotype that began developing a set of “core fonts” for Microsoft: Scalable TrueType fonts that could be shipped with Windows and used freely by every Windows customer. The new fonts had to mimic the established core set of PostScript fonts, which included Times Roman and Helvetica. Since Monotype had originally developed the Times fonts back in the hot-metal days, that part was easy. To compete with Helvetica, though, they chose to adapt an earlier Monotype design with similar characteristics, called Arial.</p>

<p>Designing the outlines for these typefaces was the kind of task that the Monotype drawing office excelled at. The hard part was the hinting, the software instructions that control the rendering on various devices. That was what would make the fonts look good on screen.</p>

<p>Monotype had a team in the UK working on font hinting, but they were running into trouble. Although they had an auto-hinting program, called TypeMan, developed by Apple’s principal TrueType developer, Sampo Kaasila, the process was proving to be long, slow, and laborious. As Greg Hitchcock describes it, Monotype in desperation Monotype “sent out the bat signal.” In response, in September 1990, he and Eliyezer made the first of many trips to the UK to provide hands-on help and supervision. This was the start of a back-and-forth pattern for Greg—three weeks in the UK, one week in Redmond—that lasted for the next nine months. Their main job was hinting type, working in little rooms in archaic buildings at the old Monotype works. …</p></section></article></div>

Still can't bear the sticker shock of your very own Talos II, or even a itty bitty Blackbird? Why not do what we all do for the machines we can't own and emulate one instead? (And then decide you like it a lot, and save your pennies?)
</p><p>
QEMU 5.0.0 offers a machine model for the bare-metal PowerNV profile, to which the Raptor systems and other OpenPOWER POWER8 and POWER9 designs intended for Linux (i.e., not PowerVM machines) belong. Using the Talos II firmware image (mostly: one snag to be mentioned), you can boot the machine in QEMU and from there bring up an operating system in emulation. In this article we'll prove it works by bringing up <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power</a> (hi, Daniel!) in a variety of configurations. A set-up like this might be enough to test that your software or open-source package builds and runs on OpenPOWER, even if you don't own one yet. In a future article we'll talk about how you can boot your own code on the metal so you can port your favourite OS or build a unikernel.
</p><p>
(For the purposes of this article I'll assume an audience that isn't as familiar with OpenPOWER terminology as our usual readership. Kindly humour me.)
</p><p>
The emulation is imperfect, both if you're emulating it on a real Raptor family system or on an icky PC. While QEMU can emulate an AST2500 (i.e., the ARM-based Baseboard Management Controller, which acts as the service processor and provides the video framebuffer), and QEMU can also emulate a PowerNV system, it doesn't do both at the same time. That means the very lowest levels are actually being simulated here -- you can't watch Raptor's pretty Hostboot display, for example, and only the barest functions of the BMC are simulated enough to allow bring-up, not including the framebuffer. In fact, the hardware profiles we will use here do not in general match a real Raptor system either: we're just virtually plugging in PCI devices that give us necessary functionality, though of course none of the peripheral devices in a Raptor system is Raptor-proprietary. Finally, even though I have tagged this entry with KVM, KVM currently doesn't work right with the QEMU PowerNV machine model even though I'm pretty sure it should be technically possible. Sadly, I tried in vain to do so, could never get KVM-HV to be happy, and ended up kernel panicking the machine with KVM-PR. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/0b95d7bea3e9a270385a2360fbcf7f40">See if you can triumph where I have failed</a>. In the meantime, naturally you can do everything here on a T2 or Blackbird as well because that's how I did it writing this article, but there is no special acceleration for those systems right now.
</p><p>
The first order of business is the first order of business with any emulator: get the ROMs. Fortunately, no one is going to bust you for pirating a set of these because we're an open platform, remember?
</p><p>
The two pieces required are Skiboot and Petitboot, both of which live in the system's PNOR flash. <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a> contains OPAL, the OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer. It comes in after the BMC has turned on main power and started the Power CPUs' self-boot engines, which then IPL ("initial program load") Hostboot for the second-stage power-on sequence. When Hostboot completes, it chains into Skiboot, which initializes the PCIe host bus controllers (PHBs) and provides all the basic hardware calls needed by a guest kernel to support the platform. You can think of it as something like an overgrown BIOS. This is the lowest firmware level of an OpenPOWER system that QEMU currently supports emulating.
</p><p>
Skiboot lives only to service a kernel, so it immediately starts one. This initial payload is the bootloader for <a href="https://github.com/open-power/petitboot">Petitboot</a>, which is also stored in firmware. Petitboot has a small Linux root (Skiroot) and acts as a boot menu, finding bootable volumes on attached devices or over the network. Having found one (or you select one), it chains into it to start the main OS, and from then on Skiboot will provide platform services via OPAL for this final guest until the system is shut down or restarted. Because it's in firmware, Petitboot is always available, which can come in really handy when you're trying to do system recovery.
</p><p>
The first, best and most dedicated way is to <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">build Skiboot and Petitboot yourself</a>. They are open-source and the process is relatively well documented and automated, and you should know how to do this if you own an OpenPOWER machine anyhow. If you aren't doing this on a real OpenPOWER machine you'll need a cross-compiler, but most Linux distros offer such a package nowadays. Do keep in mind that if it looks like you're building a tiny Linux distro, well, that's because that's exactly what you're doing. The advantage here is you can fool around with the firmware at your leisure, but it requires a bit of an investment in disk space and time.
</p><p>
The second way assumes you have a more casual interest and would prefer to go with something prefab. It's possible if you (or, you know, your "friend") has a Raptor-family system to extract the necessary components right from the BMC prompt. Log into the BMC over SSH (or via <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/04/what-to-do-when-bmc-wont-talk-to-you.html">direct serial connection</a>) and type <tt>pflash -i</tt>. You'll see a list of all the partitions stored in the PNOR flash. The ones we want are <tt>PAYLOAD</tt> (which contains Skiboot) and <tt>BOOTKERNEL</tt> (which contains Skiroot and Petitboot). The exact addresses may vary from system to system and firmware to firmware.
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# pflash -P PAYLOAD -r /tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD" from 0x021a1000..0x022a1000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%<br>
root@bmc:~# pflash -P BOOTKERNEL -r /tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL" from 0x022a1000..0x03821000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%
</tt></p><p>
We skip the first 4K page to avoid the wrapping around each partition. <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> is actually compressed and needs to be uncompressed prior to use, so:
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# cd /tmp<br>
root@bmc:/tmp# xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Finally, <tt>scp</tt> both <tt>skiboot.lid</tt> and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> to your desired system from the BMC.
</p><p>
Admittedly we just talked at length about the two ways most of you <em>won't</em> get the firmware, so let's talk about the third method and the way most of you will, i.e., you'll just download it. Currently there is an irregularity about Raptor's present Skiboot build for this purpose: it only boots if you are emulating a single <em>POWER8</em>. That's not a typo. If you use it to boot an emulated POWER9, the guest will simply panic, and the guest will go into a bootloop if you are emulating multiple POWER8 CPUs (necessary if you need a larger number of PCIe devices). This is undoubtedly a QEMU deficiency which will be corrected in future releases. In the meantime, if you just care about playing around using a single POWER8 on a terminal, then Raptor's builds (either from BMC flash or downloaded) will suffice. However, if you intend to emulate a POWER9 or SMP POWER8 system, <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/pc-bios/skiboot.lid">download QEMU's own pre-built <tt>skiboot.lid</tt></a> and use that instead.
</p><p>
For Petitboot, we will extract that directly from Raptor's PNOR images. Assuming you didn't get it using the process above, <a href="https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Talos_II/Firmware">download the current Talos II PNOR image</a> and decompress it. In the <tt>shell_upgrade</tt> directory you will see the <tt>bzip2</tt>-compressed PNOR image. Uncompress that, leaving you with a filename like <tt>talos-ii-v2.00.pnor</tt>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/4a2c907d0acec5b537cd4992a00801c3">Download my <tt>pnorex</tt> extractor tool</a> (it's in Perl, because I'm one of <em>those</em> people) and run it on the PNOR image:
</p><p>
<tt>% pnorex talos-ii-v2.00.pnor<br>
Version 1 PNOR archive with 33 entries.<br>
Extracting PAYLOAD at offset 8601.<br>
This is a xz format image.<br>
Wrote 1020K successfully.<br>
Extracting BOOTKERNEL at offset 8857.<br>
This is an ELF executable image.<br>
Wrote 22012K successfully.<br>
Extracted 2 partitions successfully.
</tt>
</p><p>
If you will be using Raptor's Skiroot, then uncompress <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> to <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> as above: <tt>xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Now, with <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> (for this first example, either Raptor's or QEMU's) and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> in the same folder, grab an ISO you want to boot. I used the prefab one Daniel offers on the <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power site</a> since I know it boots fine on OpenPOWER hardware. For our first example let's do a simple example of booting Void from a CD image on a POWER8 using the serial port. Our QEMU command line:
</p><p>
<tt>
qemu-system-ppc64 -M powernv8 -m 4G -cpu power8 \<br>
        -nographic \<br>
        -bios ./skiboot.lid \<br>
        -kernel ./pnor.BOOTKERNEL \<br>
        -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci0 \<br>
        -drive id=cd0,media=cdrom,file=void-live-ppc64le-musl-20200411.iso,if=none \<br>
        -device ide-cd,bus=ahci0.0,drive=cd0
</tt>
</p><p>
This configures a single-processor POWER8 system with 4GB of RAM, no graphics, and an Intel AHCI host controller with a single CD-ROM drive attached. The serial output should go to your terminal. It goes a little like this:
</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Here we are with Skiboot chaining into Petitboot. You can ignore the errors; there will be a lot of them since the platform is still incomplete. It will take a little bit of time to decompress the kernel (much slower than it would be on a regular system). You will notice a single device attached to the three available PCIe host bridges on the single POWER8 CPU, i.e., the host controller itself. Don't you just love that the vendor code for Intel is <tt>8086</tt>?
</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
This is Petitboot. When the bootable choices appear, cursor up to the starred option and press E before it autoboots, because we need to tell Void its console is the on-board serial port (otherwise it uses a VGA console: not sure whose bug that is).
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Add <tt>console=hvc0</tt> at the end, cursor down to <tt>OK</tt> and hit RETURN/ENTER a couple times to boot.
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
A successful login on your emulated baby POWER8. Ta-daa! To rudely pull the plug on the QEMU session, press Ctrl-A, and then X (<tt>QEMU: Terminated</tt>).
</p><p>
Let's now load out the POWER8. We would like to add a video card, an Ethernet card and a USB controller to our existing system, but POWER8 Turismo chips only offer enough PHBs for three PCI endpoints. How do we solve this problem? Easy: we'll add another processor!

<p>Last month, the Google AI blog released an article called “Federated Analytics: Collaborative Data Science without Data Collection”, delving into a mode of data science that doesn’t depend on centralised data collection. What I noticed as I was reading it was a heavy handed subtext around privacy. A ctrl+f for ‘privacy’ brought the word up thirteen times – the subtext was very much ‘at Google, we think about privacy’. But what makes this particularly interesting is that decentralised data analysis isn’t a new concept and didn’t find its origins in privacy, where Google had introduced systems for distributed analysis as early as 2014. While it’s not unusual for Google to put out content expounding some of its technical methods and processes, this article is an intentional signalling of the company’s evolved baseline perspective. Basically that privacy is a forefront concern and consideration in all its avenues of pursuit, this being just one of the many bricks in its united front against user-data related backlash.</p>

    <h3>Resealing and Upgrading Trim on a '78-'90 Volvo 240 Windshield</h3>
    <h4>13 Jun 2018</h4>
    <p>The 1990 and earlier Volvo 240 windshields are known for their frustrating trim design which was held on 
by <a href="https://www.volvopartswebstore.com/products/Volvo/240/Clip-kit-Genuine-Classic-Part/1113962/270148.html">22 plastic clips</a>, 
set into the butyl rubber used to mount the windshield. My 1989 240 developed a leak near the top right of the 
windshield due to a combination of rust and shoddy resealing done by the previous owner.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-01-07%2016.30.16.jpg" alt="1989 Volvo 240"></p>

<p>Rather than try to bodge some silicon sealant into the leaky areas and buy myself another couple of years, I chose to fully remove the windshield and 
re-glue it with urethane, replacing the chrome trim strip and clips with more modern rubber trim at the same time.</p>

<p>Using a piece of braided steel wire and two dowels as handles, I sawed through the existing urethane after poking a hole with a exacto knife to feed the wire through.
What was waiting for me underneath was not pretty.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-04-28%2013.08.22.jpg" alt="Rusty Pinchweld"></p>

<p>The pinchweld had rusted enough that there was no choice but to cut it out in several places and weld in new sheet metal:</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-03%2016.47.01.jpg" alt="Grinding out pinchweld"></p>

<p>I used a dremel with a cutting disk to remove the old metal and TIG welded in a patch with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2ya1l1F">AHP AlphaTIG 200X</a> (this job is what finally pushed me to buy it).</p>

<p>As I welded small sections, I used an air gun to cool the back side of the pinch seam to avoid setting the dashboard on fire. I kept a fire
extinguisher close by at all times regardless.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-03%2019.21.18.jpg" alt="New windshield corner"></p>

<p>I masked off the entire area and painted it with <a href="https://amzn.to/2JH2C1r">Rust-Oleum professional primer</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Rust-Oleum-Professional-High-Performance-Enamel-Spray/35031494">high performance enamel</a>. 
The silver Rust-Oleum just happens to be a very close color match to the silver on the 240.</p>

<p>Considering the horrific condition of the windshield seam before the job, the result isn’t half bad:</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-05%2020.55.08.jpg" alt="After painting"></p>

<p>Next, I had to answer a question that I couldn’t find clear information on anywhere on the internet. Is it possible to re-use a pre-‘90 style windshield 
but replace the trim with the more modern glued rubber? The answer is <strong>yes</strong>. 
You do not need to buy a whole new ‘91+ windshield if you already have an older pane of glass in good condition.</p>

<p>I bought some <a href="http://www.gggcorp.com/Universal_Mouldings.html#OriginalT">Gold Glass Group Universal Moulding T107B</a> 
on Ebay in a 15ft. roll and applied it to the edge of the old style windshield instead of the clips and chrome trim.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2018.08.02.jpg" alt="Applying Trim Closeup"></p>

<p>A test fit confirmed it fit into the windshield opening perfectly. I think moving from the 0.75” T107B to the 1” T109B trim would have been a good move, to better
cover some of the nasty surface where the old trim sat. During the test fit I made some marks around the perimeter to help locate the 
windshield later when I installed the urethane.</p>

<p>I bought two tubes of <a href="https://amzn.to/2HLgUfO">DOW U-428 Plus Primerless Windshield Adhesive</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2JJCxii">air powered caulk gun</a> and 
laid down a bead about 9mm tall on the seam. The air powered caulk gun was absolutely essential; the U-428 is so thick that you could never
extrude it from a hand powered gun. I had the regulator on my compressor at nearly 60 PSI to get it to flow. I only ended up using one tube, but this isn’t the kind of job you can afford to run out of adhesive 90% of the way through!</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2018.49.28.jpg" alt="Applying Urethane"></p>

<p>With a helper, I lifted the windshield in and set it in place. We made final position adjustments and taped it in place with some blue tape. 
For the temperature and humidity of my location, Dow calls for at least 5 hours of cure time before drive-off.</p>

<p>Overall, a pretty long process but nothing an experienced garage fabricator couldn’t do on their own. The final result doesn’t look too bad:</p>

<p>I’m sure it’s a horrible misuse of the urethane, but I had a few grams left over, so I used it to glue the perpetually falling off glovebox back together:</p>
