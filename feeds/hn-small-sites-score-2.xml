</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>
<span>This content was published on November 26, 2020 - 11:34</span>
<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

November 27, 2020 | https://blog.peterzhu.ca/ruby-range-bsearch/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.peterzhu.ca/ruby-range-bsearch/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38
2.7093655358260904e+19

42.92431640625
42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

The point is that these devices will work, for <strong>some people. </strong>That is to say that too many people go and buy these devices hoping they'll motivate them to move more, but this just isn't the case; consumers misperceive what are in fact data trackers as motivational tools.</span></p><blockquote id="viewer-1dp63"><span>
“Fitness trackers are equivalent to a bathroom scale,” says Eric Finkelstein, lead author of the Lancet study. “They’re a measurement tool, not an intervention tool. They tell you something, but don’t give you a strategy for how to change it.”</span></blockquote><h3 id="viewer-4sqnd"><span><strong>Should you still go out and buy one?</strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-fnpda"><span>As I said before, the usefulness of these devices varies from person to person, if you think that receiving a bunch of data about how much you’re moving on a regular basis will motivate to stay active then sure!

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainscape</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Brainscape-logo.png" alt="Brainscape logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> web, Android, iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>
<h3>5. <a href="http://smartcardsplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartCards+</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/SmartCards-logo.png" alt="SmartCards+ logo"></picture> <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<![CDATA[SQLite as a Document Database]]>
            </title>
            <description>

November 26, 2020 | https://dgl.cx/2020/06/sqlite-json-support | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dgl.cx/2020/06/sqlite-json-support">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.
</p>

<![CDATA[Mastering Unix Pipes, Part 1 – Moritz Systems]]>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>

</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

For example, it integrates with the rest of the home security system — using machine learning to identify humans, cars, animals, and more:</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg.webp 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg.webp 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg.webp 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg.webp 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg.webp 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg.webp 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg.webp 442w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" alt="DIY smart doorbell detects a guest visitor with AI computer vision" width="1024" height="1024" title="Detecting a person approaching" srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-1024x1024.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2.jpg 2048w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-214x214.jpg 214w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-540x540.jpg 540w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-344x344.jpg 344w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17145125/936F84BB-EC48-4F64-975B-8BC87C2E7EE2-442x442.jpg 442w"></picture><figcaption>The smart doorbell uses TensorFlow to detect people, cars, animals, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p><h2><span id="Designing_the_Smart_Doorbell"></span>Designing the Smart Doorbell<span></span></h2><p>Doorbells live outside.</p><p>Okay, that’s obvious. But it was my first electronic project that needed to <em>survive the elements</em>. To that end, I decided to use a <strong>junction box</strong> to house the electronics themselves.</p><p>The next requirement was also obvious: a <strong>button</strong>. However, the concern with such a unique design is that visitors need to intuitively understand <em>what the device is</em>. I decided upon a durable metal button that also lights up.

This is arguably the most important security camera in the entire house, and I didn’t have a lot of space in the junction box, so I splurged on a <strong>night-vision IR camera</strong> with a microphone built-in.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<p>We are not alone in believing in the idea of a cloudless IoT. In the IoT community, the concept is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing" target="_blank">edge</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_computing" target="_blank">fog</a> computing. There are entire software platforms, such as the <a href="https://litmusautomation.com/en/loopedge/" target="_blank">Litmus LoopEdge platform</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-edge/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Edge</a>, and the <a href="https://crosser.io/solutions/iot-edge-analytics/" target="_blank">Crosser IoT edge analytics suite</a>, that are built to run off the grid. There are even custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/" target="_blank">hardware chips</a> designed to support off-the-cloud computation, usually speech&nbsp;processing.</p>
<p>There also an old adage that <i>the Internet of things without the Internet is just … things</i>. This is not true: there are many situations where IoT systems without Internet can be as valuable as Internet-enabled IoT&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>We at Thingsquare have built and deployed several cloudless IoT systems with the no-cloud version of our IoT platform,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electrical generators</strong>. These are deployed in a remote location where there is little or no Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial machinery</strong>. These are deployed as a completely standalone product with a separate touch screen on the local&nbsp;controller.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial lighting</strong>. These are run in places where customers want a completely siloed&nbsp;system.</li>
</ul>

<p>But let’s first look at why we use the cloud at all. Because there are good reasons for doing&nbsp;so.</p>

<h2 id="why-iot-in-the-cloud-">Why IoT in the&nbsp;cloud?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons for why the backend logic of an IoT system is run in the&nbsp;cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data storage</strong>: The cloud can store an almost unlimited amount of&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Computation</strong>: Some mechanisms needs an abundance of computational power, which is something that the cloud can provide an almost unlimited amount&nbsp;of.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: To provide users with remote access to the data generated by the IoT devices, or to control the devices themselves, you need to have a cloud service that connects the devices with their&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Access control</strong>: The cloud can provide effective access control mechanisms for your&nbsp;users.</li>
<li><strong>Data cross-referencing</strong>: To be able to run effective machine learning algorithms, you sometimes need access to a wide range of data. The cloud lets you collect data from more than one site to cross-reference and combine this&nbsp;data.</li>
<li><strong>Application integration</strong>: IoT systems rarely run on their own. Integration with other software systems is much easier if the backend is located in a single place: the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Security updates</strong>: when the IoT backend is run in the cloud, a dedicated security team can keep track of and apply security updates as&nbsp;needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These reasons, which are good reasons, are why most IoT systems today are provided through the cloud. Thingsquare is no&nbsp;exception.</p>
<p>The backend portion of the <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/iot-platform/">Thingsquare IoT platform</a> is originally designed to be run in the cloud. Sometimes the backend is running on a typical cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, and sometimes the backend is installed on a hosted machine, as a traditional on-premise software&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>But the running the IoT backend in cloud does come with some&nbsp;drawbacks.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloudless-iot-">Why cloudless&nbsp;IoT?</h2>
<p>There are good reasons to not rely on an always-on cloud connection for every IoT&nbsp;project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: cloud services may go down so avoiding the cloud may therefore increase&nbsp;stability.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong>: cloud services may go away so avoiding the cloud may allow the IoT system to run for ever, without relying on the hosting company to&nbsp;persist.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy</strong>: sometimes data should not leave the location where it is&nbsp;generated.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: fewer network connections means fewer attack&nbsp;vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Necessity</strong>: sometimes there just isn’t Internet&nbsp;access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any cloud-based software may become unreachable if the cloud goes down. This can happen even for <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/google-cloud-down" target="_blank">companies like Google</a>, who arguably has state-of-the-art cloud infrastructures and one of the best cloud teams in the world. Any IoT solution that wholly depends on the cloud will suffer an outage if the cloud goes&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Because the cloud service is a living thing, it may die. This can happen if the company that runs the service goes away or if it simply decides that it is no longer economical to keep it running. There are several <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/best-buys-iot-goes-dark-leaving-some-smart-products-dumbfounded/">real-world</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/4/11362928/google-nest-revolv-shutdown-smart-home-products">examples</a> of&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>But the most compelling reason to why use a cloudless IoT system is when Internet access is unavailable. At Thingsquare, we have been working with projects where the IoT system is deployed in rural Africa, where Internet access is spotty at best. And with projects in countries Internet access has been generally available, but where the IoT system has been inside a deep cellar where 4G access was&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-cloudless-iot">The challenges of cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Moving the IoT backend away from the cloud, closer to the IoT devices presents a number of&nbsp;challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: authentication is significantly easier with the cloud, thanks to mechanisms such as 2 factor&nbsp;authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Remote access</strong>: providing remote access without the cloud is very difficult and in most cases&nbsp;impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Data processing</strong>: crunching numbers without having access to the abundance of storage and computation that the cloud provides is significantly&nbsp;harder.</li>
<li><strong>Software deployment</strong>: many IoT systems need data processing or similar mechanisms, and these systems are often designed to be run in the&nbsp;cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Software updates</strong>: software is a living thing and needs to be kept up to&nbsp;date.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues result in trade-offs. Any IoT system that is deployed away from the cloud must be prepared to deal with&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2 id="a-practical-approach-to-a-cloudless-iot">A practical approach to a cloudless&nbsp;IoT</h2>
<p>Thingsquare takes a deliberately simple approach to the cloudless&nbsp;IoT:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run our IoT backend on a non-connected local&nbsp;controller</li>
<li>Deal with resulting the trade-offs on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis</li>
</ul>
<p>The local controller can run on a piece of hardware similar to a Raspberry Pi. The local controller is deployed on an on-site network and we provide a user interface over that network only. The user interface is accessible through a smartphone app, which can detect nearby local controllers via Bluetooth, and let users interact with&nbsp;devices.</p>
<p>The backend logic of the IoT application, which would normally run in the cloud, also runs on the local controller. This also means that the backend application must be scaled down to the limits of a Raspberry Pi-class&nbsp;device.</p>

</div>


<p>Since we cannot expect the local controller hardware to be as robust as a cloud host, particularly if the local controller is based on an <span>SD</span> drive, we limit disk writes by storing volatile data in memory. This means that software that runs on top of the API must be prepared to deal with having access to less&nbsp;data.</p>
<h3 id="user-authentication">User&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>To authenticate users, we use a two-tiered approach. The first tier is to leverage the existing access control to the local WiFi. If a user is authenticated to the local WiFi, this tier assumes that the user also should have access to the local controller and its devices. It is possible to configure the access level that such non-authenticated local users should&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>The second tier uses a hybrid approach: we use the cloud to authenticate the user and provide an access token to the local controller. The local controller announces its presence with encrypted Bluetooth beacons that the smartphone app uses to authenticate each user. This requires the users to have an account in the cloud. The app checks with the cloud server to match the encrypted beacon and the user account. If the user has access, the server responds with an access key to the local&nbsp;controller.</p>
<h3 id="device-authentication">Device&nbsp;authentication</h3>
<p>Device authentication is comparatively easier than user authentication, because devices can be preprogrammed with <span>TLS</span> certificates. We&nbsp;there</p>
<h3 id="software-delivery-with-a-git-repository">Software delivery with a git&nbsp;repository</h3>
<p>We deliver all software over a managed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git repository</a>. This repository can be updated by connecting the local controller to the Internet and requesting an update, or manually via a <span>USB</span>&nbsp;stick.</p>

<p>Signed firmware update files are included in the git repository. Devices may request updates from the local controller, just as they do when they are connected to a cloud&nbsp;backend.</p>
<p>Because we use the full IoT backend software, <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/network-updates">full-network <span>OTA</span> updates</a> work as&nbsp;usual.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User&nbsp;interface</h3>
<p>The local controller may present a user interface with a touch screen physically connected to the controller, or over the WiFi to smartphone apps on the same network. By default, the user interface is implemented via <span>HTML5</span>/JS/CSS and is updated via the git&nbsp;repository.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The cloud is an integral part of the Internet of Things. But there are situations in which the cloud is not the best&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>Thingsquare provides a local, cloudless IoT solution, based on the same software that is backing our cloud-based offering, that solves the problems with software delivery, user interface access, and firmware updates for the cloudless&nbsp;IoT.</p>

<p>Every day I go for a 45-minute walk first thing in the morning. I’ve been doing it for almost two months now, I think. And it has become one of the most essential parts of my daily routine.</p>



<p>Walking awakens my mind and my body. It makes me feel energized, sharp and clear-headed. It helps me disentangle my thoughts, digest experiences and see unfamiliar patterns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe that’s why it’s so easy for me to write while I walk. Why it comes so naturally. I hate to admit it, but for some reason I struggle to write standing still. I need cadence. I need movement.</p>



<p>When I walk, my mind and my body move together. They ride and go along in unison, creating a feeling of immense tranquillity and equilibrium. Even when I’m witnessing dark or conflicting thoughts, it all flows smoothly.</p>



<p>I’ve always like walking. And I think I’ve also known for a while how much it helps me. Despite that, though, it was never a consistent habit. It was always occasional.</p>



<p>But now I seriously doubt I could go on with my life without doing it every day. I would go mad. Especially now that I call myself a creator.</p>



<p>Walking has become not just indispensable to my work and productivity, but also to my happiness and well-being — it is a form of self-care, even therapy.</p>


<p><em>This piece is part of a series of 30 atomic essays where I explore what it means to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://rationalcreatives.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rational creative</a>&nbsp;and the different aspects of being a creator online.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43
The following values were inspected:
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
32
48
40
44
42
43
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001
The following values were inspected:
1.5
1.6759759912428246e+154
1.5921412270130977e+77
4.8915590244884904e+38
2.7093655358260904e+19

42.92431640625
42.424560546875
42.1746826171875
...
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

<div>
<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_5">Chang’e 5</a> is a Chinese lunar sample return mission. It was launched a few days ago on 2020-11-23 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Satellite_Launch_Center">Wenchang</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782149490413568">is estimated</a> to perform lunar orbit injection on Saturday. Since then, a number of Amateurs such as <a href="https://twitter.com/usa_satcom/status/1331092113069543425">USA Satcom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/uhf_satcom/status/1331317024992210944">Paul Marsh M0EYT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331138035891650560">Scott Tilley VE7TIL</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/supertrack_it/status/1331354629146365953">Fer IW1DTU</a> and others have been receiving the X-band signals from the spacecraft and posting reports over on Twitter. Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vcid1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png" alt="" width="483" height="487" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-644x649.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-298x300.png 298w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-768x774.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid815.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></a></figure>



<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png" alt="" width="644" height="640" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-300x298.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-768x763.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>

    <p>Oh boy, am I glad that I trusted my gut feeling.</p>

<p>You probably know the type of badge I’m talking about.  It’s tiny, lives in the lower-right corner of the screen and says something like “by Jakob Greenfeld”.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/tinybadge.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But not too many indie makers seem to be using it. I hesitated myself. It makes the fact that the project is an indie project immediately obvious. Hence the project will be perceived as less professional. Also it possibly distracts customers and might annoy some of them.</p>

<p>So there are lots of reasons why you shouldn’t include a badge and not really many objective ones why you should.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I decided to include one on all of my pages. The main reason was that I instantly like a page more if it has such a badge (and not some annoying chat widget or whatever.) It shows me directly that I’m a looking at a project by a fellow indie maker. I really think of the badge as some kind of membership card for the indie maker club.</p>

<p>Okay, enough of this. You’re probably not here to hear about my sentimental feelings.</p>

<p>So let’s get back to the main story.</p>

<p>Now what happened is that yesterday I’m getting lots of new followers even though I didn’t write a single tweet. Also I’m getting lots of Gumroad notifications.</p>

<p><em>“You have a new subscriber for <a href="https://gumspy.com/">Gum Spy</a>”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”, “You have a new subscriber for Gum Spy”….</em></p>

<p>Cool, but strange. Something must be happening but I have no idea what.</p>

<p>Then I get a DM from <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevMcKendrick">Trevor McKendrick</a> (Chief of Staff @ Lambda School).</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/dm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Apparently, Sam Parr and Shaan Puri talked about me on <a href="https://www.myfirstmillionpodcast.com/">their podcast</a>. The show has hundreds of thousands of listeners. I’m just a guy with 600 Twitter followers who launched his first paid product 4 weeks ago. This is insane.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/496MjbRwFPa52tqdJBvC3m?si=QrBc05p3TlOgEFDl9iqRNA">episode</a>, Shaan mentions that he discovered my stuff because of a tiny badge in the lower-right corner on the Gum Spy landing page.</p>

<p>Without the badge, my site would’ve been just another faceless project. But thanks to the badge, Shaan was quickly able to see that I’m a “build in public type of guy”, that I’m currently doing a <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/mba">Bootstrap MBA learning experiment</a>,  that I recently launched similar projects. And this is why he decided to give me a shoutout on the show.</p>

<p>You probably thought the title of this post is clickbait. It’s not.</p>

<p>I really made dozens of sales (still counting) and got hundreds of new <a href="https://twitter.com/jakobgreenfeld">Twitter followers</a> and <a href="https://productideas.substack.com/">newsletter subscribers</a> only thanks to the tiny badge.</p>

<p>So what’s the takeaway? Use a “made by” badge on your sites, obviously.</p>

<p>And no worries, I’m not trying to sell you some “made by” badge service. The code for the badge I’m using is <a href="https://gist.github.com/levelsio/9c531122e557da6282458bbc2a8e2aff">freely available</a> (thanks <a href="https://levels.ui/">Pieter</a>!) and is so simple that really anyone can use it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Many years ago, Peter Norvig wrote a beautiful article <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">about creating a lisp interpreter in Python</a>. It’s the most fun tutorial I’ve seen, not just because it teaches you about my favorite language family (Lisp), but because it cuts through to the essence of interpreters, is fun to follow and quick to finish.</p><p>Recently, I had some time and wanted to learn Rust. It’s a beautiful systems language, and I’ve seen some great work come out from those who adopt it. I thought, <em>what better way to learn Rust, than to create a lisp interpreter in it?</em></p><p><strong>Hence, Risp — a lisp in rust — was born.</strong> In this essay you and I will follow along with <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html" target="_blank">Norvig’s Lispy</a>, but instead of Python, we’ll do it in Rust 🙂.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of lisp, some Paul Graham’s essays (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html" target="_blank">one</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/diff.html" target="_blank">two</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">three</a>), alongside some <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a> will get you fired up. In short, everything is a list, everything is an expression, and that makes for a very powerful language.</p><p>Our structure will be similar to Norvig’s tutorial, though I depart slightly in two ways:</p><ol><li>Instead of 2 stopping points (Lispy Calculator and Full Lispy), we have 4 stopping points. This reflects the phases I took to build it in Rust.</li><li>Norvig’s syntax is based on Scheme. We will base it on Scheme too, but since I’m also a Clojure fan, I sometimes used slightly different naming, and different implementations for a few functions. I will note when I do that in the essay.</li></ol><p>Finally, this is the first program I wrote in Rust. I may have misused some things, so if you’re a Rust hacker, I’d love to hear your feedback 🙂.</p><p>With the notes out of the way, let’s get into it.</p><p>As Norvig suggests, our first goal is to create a subset of lisp, that can do what a basic calculator can do.</p><p>To make it as simple as possible to follow, for language 1, <strong>we’ll <em>only</em> support addition and subtraction.</strong> No variable definitions, no if statements, nada.</p><p>This departs a bit from Lispy, but I found this stopping point a lot more convenient when writing it in Rust. So, our goal:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>//=&gt; 17</span>
<span>(</span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; 3</span></code></pre><p>The important process we need to remember is the flow of an interpreter:</p><p><em>our program</em> ⟶ <em><strong>parse</strong></em> ⟶ <em>abstract syntax tree</em> ⟶ <em><strong>eval</strong></em> ⟶ <em>result</em></p><p>We will need to <strong>parse</strong> our program and convert it into an abstract syntax tree. After that, we can <strong>eval</strong> the abstract syntax tree and get our result. (Refer to Norvig’s article for more detailed definitions and explanations).</p><h2 id="type-definitions">Type Definitions</h2><p>Risp can have three kinds of values for now:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispExp</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
<span>  </span><span>List</span><span>(</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>),</span>
<span>} </span></code></pre><p>We’ll also need an error type. We’ll keep this simple, but if you’re curious there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19812159" target="_blank">more robust approach</a>.</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispErr</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Reason</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Finally, we’ll need an <em>environment</em> type. This is where we will store defined variables, built-in functions, and so forth:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>struct</span><span> </span><span>RispEnv</span><span> {</span>
<span>  data: HashMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>, RispExp</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2><p>Our goal is to take our program, and build an abstract syntax tree from it. For us, that is going to be a <code>RispExp</code>. To do this, first we will take our program, and cut it up into a bunch of tokens:</p><pre><code><span>tokenize(</span><span>"(+ 10 5)"</span><span>) </span><span>//=&gt; ["(", "+", "10", "5", ")"]</span></code></pre><p>Here’s how we can do that in Rust:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>tokenize</span><span>(expr: </span><span>String</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt; {</span>
<span>  expr</span>
<span>    .</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"("</span><span>, </span><span>" ( "</span><span>)</span>
<span>    .</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>")"</span><span>, </span><span>" ) "</span><span>)</span>
<span>    .</span><span>split_whitespace</span><span>()</span>
<span>    .</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span><span> x.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())</span>
<span>    .</span><span>collect</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can parse these tokens, into a <code>RispExp</code>:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;(tokens: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(RispExp, &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]), RispErr&gt; {</span>
<span>  </span><span>let</span><span> (token, rest) </span><span>=</span><span> tokens.</span><span>split_first</span><span>()</span>
<span>    .</span><span>ok_or</span><span>(</span>
<span>      RispErr</span><span>::</span><span>Reason</span><span>(</span><span>"could not get token"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>())</span>
<span>    )?;</span>
<span>  </span><span>match</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>token[..] {</span>

<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>I depart slightly from Norvig’s implementation, by returning the “next” slice. This lets us recurse and parse nested lists, without mutating the original list.</em></p><p>We get the token for the current position. If it’s the beginning of a list “(“, we start reading and parsing the tokens that follow, until we hit a closing parenthesis:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>read_seq</span><span>&lt;</span><span>'a</span><span>&gt;(tokens: &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(RispExp, &amp;</span><span>'a</span><span> [</span><span>String</span><span>]), RispErr&gt; {</span>

<span>      .</span><span>ok_or</span><span>(RispErr</span><span>::</span><span>Reason</span><span>(</span><span>"could not find closing `)`"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>()))</span>
<span>      ?;</span>
<span>    </span><span>if</span><span> next_token </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>")"</span><span> {</span>
<span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>((RispExp</span><span>::</span><span>List</span><span>(res), rest)) </span><span>// skip `)`, head to the token after</span>

<span>    xs </span><span>=</span><span> new_xs;</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>If it’s a closing tag of a list “)”, we return an error, as read_seq should have skipped past it.</p><p>Otherwise, it can only be an atom, so we parse that:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>parse_atom</span><span>(token: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>) -&gt; RispExp {      </span>

<span>  </span><span>match</span><span> potential_float {</span>
<span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(v) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> RispExp</span><span>::</span><span>Number</span><span>(v),</span>

<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h2 id="environment">Environment</h2><p>Let’s go ahead and create the default, global environment. As Norvig explains, environments are where we will store variable definitions and built-in functions.</p><p>To implement built-in operations <code>(+, -)</code>, we need a way to save rust function references. Let’s update <code>RispExp</code>, so that we can store rust function references:</p><pre><code><span>#[derive(Clone)]</span>
<span>enum</span><span> </span><span>RispExp</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>),</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can create a <code>default_env</code> function, that returns a <code>RispEnv</code>, which implements +, and -</p><pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>default_env</span><span>() -&gt; RispEnv {</span>

<p>A pipe is a first-in-first-out interprocess communication channel.
The pipe version as it is known today was invented by an American Computer Scientist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Douglas McIlroy</a>
and incorporated into Version 3 AT&amp;T UNIX in 1973 by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.</p>

<p>It was inspired by the observation that frequently the output of one application is
used as an input for another. This concept can be reused to connect a chain
of processes. This is frequently observed
in UNIX shell constructs that utilize the <code>|</code> operator.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ find lib -name *.c | awk -F <span>'/'</span> <span>'{print $NF}'</span> | sort -u | tail
yp_maplist.c
yp_master.c
yp_match.c
yp_order.c
yperr_string.c
yplib.c
ypprot_err.c
yyerror.c
zdump.c
zic.c</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be illustrated as a sequence of processes and pipes connecting the programs.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-chain.svg" alt="pipe chain"></p>

<p>This concept of connecting the UNIX tools has been expanded to various native tools,
such as the troff formatting system, that are specifically designed to be used in pipelines.
The troff format and the associated toolkit are still used in the NetBSD Operating System.
The build rules, producing the <code>.ps</code> files (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>)
look like this one, for
the kernmalloc (the kernel allocator documentation) example:</p>

<h2 id="the-c-interface-for-pipes">The C interface for pipes</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pipe.html">POSIX specification</a>
declares the <code>pipe</code> function with the following signature:</p>



<p>inside the <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code> header.</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> function takes an array of two integers, and writes file descriptors
of the read and write end of the pipe into it upon successful return.
The <code>fildes[0]</code> file descriptor is opened for reading and <code>fildes[1]</code> for writing.
Some implementations of UNIX allow using the <code>fildes[0]</code> end for writing too and <code>fildes[1]</code> for reading
(the full duplex mode), but this behavior is unspecified by POSIX and it is only safe to assume that
they are unidirectional (half duplex mode).</p>

<p>The <code>pipe</code> call can fail and return <code>-1</code>, setting appropriate <code>errno</code>
if the process (<code>EMFILE</code>) or the system (<code>ENFILE</code>) expired the allowed number of
open file descriptors.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-in-process.svg" alt="pipe in a process"></p>

<p>This interface as it looks is appropriate only for processes that have the shared ancestor (usually the direct parent)
and is usually combined with <code>fork(2)</code>/<code>vfork(2)</code>/<code>posix_spawn(3)</code> or an equivalent interface
(otherwise the pipe would be a futile feature).
To workaround the limitation of having the shared predecessor,
the fifo special files or UNIX domain sockets can be used.</p>

<p>In the UNIX system, file descriptors are inherited by children by default (with some exceptions in modern APIs)
and thus the created pipe, referenced by the array of two file descriptors, connects the child and the parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>In order to make the pipe effective, the user has to decide the direction of the data flow and
close the other ends. If the intention is to send data from process A to process B, then we need
to close the <code>fildes[0]</code> (reading) end in process A and <code>fildes[1]</code> (writing) end in process B.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/pipe-after-fork2.svg" alt="pipe after fork"></p>

<p>Now, the processes can transmit data over the pipe channel.</p>

<p>This algorithm is coded as follows:</p>

	}

	<span>if</span> (wait(<span>&amp;</span>status) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>NB. For the sake of simplicity, certain code paths such as handling interrupts (<code>EINTR</code>) were omitted.</p>

<p>The execution of this program results with:</p>



<p>The UNIX designers put the following constraints on the pipes (assuming <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> not set):</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the readable end of the pipe is closed, any attempt done to write results with <code>SIGPIPE</code> emitted into the writing process.
A process can either be killed or catch or ignore the signal and then needs to handle the error (<code>-1</code> and errno set to <code>EPIPE</code>) manually.</li>
<li>Once the writable end of the pipe is closed, an attempt to read from the pipe returns <code>0</code> and notifes <code>EOF</code> on the file descriptor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of free space inside the pipe (kernel buffering) is limited and implementation specific.</li>
<li>When the child process starts, the default stdio I/O buffering on pipes defaults to the fully buffered mode.
The three basic approaches to workaround this are:

<ul>
<li>using <code>fflush(3)</code> explicitly,</li>
<li>changing the buffering mode (<code>setvbuf(3)</code>) or</li>
<li>using pseudo terminals if the child process is not modifiable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-kernel-pipe-buffer-size">The kernel pipe buffer size</h2>

<p>The size of the kernel buffer storing the pipe data is limited and will cause further attempts to <code>write(2)</code> data to block
until the space is regained, by the <code>read(2)</code> operation on the other end.
The minimum acceptable value in a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/limits.h.html">POSIX system</a>
is set to 512 bytes.</p>

<p>In order to check the maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe, a programer can use the compiler constant <code>PIPE_BUF</code> or
the dynamic value <code>_PC_PIPE_BUF</code> passed to <code>pathconf(2)</code> or <code>fpathconf(2)</code>.
<code>pathconf(2)</code> and <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on:</p>

<ul>
<li>directories that can contain fifo files,</li>
<li>fifo files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <code>fpathconf(2)</code> can be applied on the pipe file descriptor.</p>

<p>However, the real number is usually larger. It can be retrieved with <code>ioctl(FIONSPACE)</code> on NetBSD.
This feature is unavailable on other systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, thus FreeBSD implements
<code>FIONSPACE</code> for sockets, but not for pipes.</p>

	printf(<span>"FIONSPACE fildes[1]: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>An alternative approach to check the maximum buffer size of the pipe feature is to count the
bytes writable into it manually, one by one, and to detect the hang.
This can be achieved for example with the <code>alarm(3)</code> call, unblocking the hang.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;signal.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>static</span> <span>int</span> n;

<span>static</span> <span>void</span>
<span>sighand</span>(<span>int</span> s)
{

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);
	exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];

	<span>if</span> (signal(SIGALRM, sighand) <span>==</span> SIG_ERR)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"signal"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	alarm(<span>5</span>); <span>/* arm the alarm to 5 seconds */</span>

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* if we ended up here, there was an error */</span>
	err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);
}</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, one could set the pipe end in the non-blocking mode.
This can be achieved with
the <code>fcntl(2)</code> call and the <code>F_SETFL</code> + <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> mode on pipes causes the following change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing into a full pipe buffer returns with <code>-1</code> and errno <code>EAGAIN</code>, instead of blocking.</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) - Public Domain Dedication */</span>
<span>#include</span> <span>&lt;err.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;errno.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;limits.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span>
<span>main</span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>char</span> <span>**</span>argv)
{
	<span>int</span> fildes[<span>2</span>];
	<span>int</span> n;

	<span>if</span> (pipe(fildes) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"pipe"</span>);

	<span>if</span> (fcntl(fildes[<span>1</span>], F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"fcntl"</span>);

	<span>while</span> (write(fildes[<span>1</span>], <span>"x"</span>, <span>1</span>) <span>!=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>)
		<span>++</span>n;

	<span>/* filter real errors from the unavailable for now resource */</span>
	<span>if</span> (errno <span>!=</span> EAGAIN)
		err(EXIT_FAILURE, <span>"write"</span>);

	printf(<span>"bytes written into the pipe: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, n);

	<span>return</span> EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few other kernel specific approaches to guess the maximum buffer size
that can be stored inside the kernel. One of them is to read <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> from <code>&lt;sys/pipe.h&gt;</code>
on BSD systems, but given that it is 16384 for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, it’s merely an
internal implementation specific header.</p>

<p>In order to make the picture fuller, we need to mention that the FreeBSD and NetBSD kernels
allow tuning of the pipe behavior and investigating
the kernel virtual address spent on the buffers.</p>

<p>FreeBSD provides the following <code>sysctl</code> knobs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizeallowed</code>: Pipe resizing allowed</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.piperesizefail</code>: Pipe resize failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipeallocfail</code>: Pipe allocation failures</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipefragretry</code>: Pipe allocation retries due to fragmentation</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.pipekva</code>: Pipe KVA usage</li>
<li><code>kern.ipc.maxpipekva</code>: Pipe KVA limit</li>
</ul>

<p>NetBSD:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>kern.pipe.maxbigpipes</code>: Maximum number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.nbigpipes</code>: Number of “big” pipes</li>
<li><code>kern.pipe.kvasize</code>: Amount of kernel memory consumed by pipe buffers</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenBSD does not provide any similar <code>sysctl</code> functionality for pipes.</p>

<p>What are “big” pipes in NetBSD? They are special case pipes that exceed <code>PIPE_SIZE</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	In the race to develop and produce a COVID-19 vaccine, Canada is on the sidelines despite its once notable status as a global source for life-saving injections.</p>
<p>
	Canada lost that standing long ago, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau explained this week, which means even if the country had developed its own novel coronavirus vaccine, there would be no means to produce it on the scale required.</p>
<p>
	â€œWe used to have [production capacity] decades ago but we no longer have it,â€� Trudeau said <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/pm-touts-deal-for-26k-doses-of-covid-19-therapeutic-seeks-to-temper-vaccine-expectations-1.5202350" target="_blank">Tuesday in Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>
	How did it get to this point? Canadian administrations simply took their â€œeye off the ball,â€� said Earl Brown, an infectious disease expert and a former member of the H1N1 vaccine task group in Canada. After that pandemic, a review found that vaccine production capacity was â€œright at the topâ€� of the list of problems, he said. It wasnâ€™t always that way.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><em><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	â€œWe had great vaccine producers in Canada -- world leaders essentially -- 50 years ago,â€� he told CTVâ€™s Your Morning on Wednesday. There was Connaught Laboratories in Toronto, which was known for producing insulin to treat diabetes and inoculants for diphtheria and polio, and Institut Armand Frappier in Montreal that produced vaccines, including one for tuberculosis, he noted.</p>
<p>
	â€œThe problem was they had a poor business model,â€� said Brown. â€œThese were vaccine companies spun off from universities, so there was indirect funding and they had a model of not making so much profit.â€�</p>
<p>
	So they were eventually sold, Montreal's Frappier lab to British multinational GlaxoSmithKline and Connaught, through a series of mergers, to French multinational Sanofi Pasteurâ€‹ after Brian Mulroneyâ€™s Progressive Conservative government's program of privatizationâ€‹. The labs now have a â€œtighter production line and not so much capacity,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	The inability to mount a domestic production campaign means that the Canadian government must rely on purchase agreements with top U.S. and European pharmaceutical brands, including <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/a-long-way-from-lab-bench-to-bedside-virus-experts-urge-covid-19-vaccine-caution-1.5199238" target="_blank">Pfizer, Moderna</a> and <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shown-to-be-effective-and-cheaper-1.5200355" target="_blank">AstraZeneca</a>, to produce and provide the shots to Canadians once the vaccines are approved by Health Canada. In the absence of a domestic candidate, Ottawa has ordered as many as 414 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine candidates from seven different companies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>'A MAJOR GLITCH'</strong></p>
<p>
	There are some promising vaccine candidates in development across Canada, including Quebecâ€™s Medicago and Saskatchewanâ€™s VIDO-InterVac, but the companies lack the means to produce them here. What would that mean for rollout should those candidates be successful?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThatâ€™s a major glitch,â€� said Brown. â€œYouâ€™re going to have to get a partner, somebody whoâ€™s got the ability to do that and then you have to get them onside, tuned up, send them your vaccine, get it produced and bottled. Not the best way to do it.â€�</p>
<p>
	For those Canadian companies to mount production campaigns on their own will take time -- and a lot of it, they have said. VIDO-InterVac said it has plans to build a facility in one year, but that it would take another still to get it in operating shape. â€œThatâ€™s not the time frame you like,â€� said Brown.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, Canadians will have to rely on speedier countries with approved COVID-19 vaccines to provide doses, but Canadians won't be prioritized ahead of their own people. â€œCountries like the United States, Germany and the U.K. do have domestic pharmaceutical facilities, which is why theyâ€™re obviously going to prioritize helping their citizens first,â€� Trudeau said on Tuesday in Ottawa.</p>
<p>
	To help Canadians first, the federal government should set up a Crown corporation to produce vaccines, suggests Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus with York Universityâ€™s School of Health Policy and Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œItâ€™s one thing if we give up the ability to domestically make something like laundry detergent. We can all live without laundry detergent. But when it comes to medications and vaccines, those are critical for the health of Canadians and we should be able to make them ourselves,â€� he told CTV National News. â€œNot only will the ability to domestically produce them ensure that Canadians get the care that they need, but we can also fulfill our human rights obligations by exporting them at low cost to low- and middle-income countries.â€�</p>
<p>
	<strong>'GROSS INCOMPETENCE'</strong></p>
<p>
	The reliance on other countries and private companies is upsetting critics of Trudeau, who said Tuesday that his administration has begun funding domestic vaccine production capacity because â€œwe never want to be caught short again.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	â€œThis is gross incompetence thatâ€™s going to cost Canadians their lives and their jobs,â€� said Conservative health critic Michelle Rempel Garner on Tuesday from Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>
	But criticism toward one governmentâ€™s inaction may often easily be directed at another with hindsight, countered Brown on Your Morning.</p>
<p>
	â€œWhen you have the problem, you look back and say â€˜We should have done something, shouldnâ€™t we?â€™â€� he said.</p>
<p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1684">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p><a href="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bilalhafeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DutchStock.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="285"></a></p>
<p>In the 1600s, the world’s first stock exchange was established in Amsterdam. In 1688, a trader by the name of Josef de la Vega wrote “<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Confusion-Confusiones-Portions-Descriptive-Amsterdam/dp/1614274517/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1536921443&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=confusion+de+confusiones">Confusion Of Confusions</a>” – the world’s oldest surviving account of trading stocks. The book is an amazing record of the business. Yet despite being written over 300 years ago, it sounds eerily familiar to our markets today.<span id="more-1684"></span></p>
<p><strong>Addiction</strong></p>
<p>First off, De la Vega has no illusions about the dark side of the industry. He describes the Dutch stock market as “the fairest and most deceitful in Europe…the finest and the most vulgar on earth.” He laments that “this business has been converted into a game, and merchants [concerned in it] have become speculators.” And “what is worse, a portion of the stock brokers have become card-sharpers [hustlers, exploiters]”. Yet, “it is great error to assume that you can withdraw [temporarily] from the Exchange or that you can gain peace of mind when you cease to meet with the other speculators…He who entered the circle of the Exchange is in eternal agitation and sits in a prison, the key of which lies in the ocean and the bars of which never open.”</p>
<p><strong>4 Principles</strong></p>
<p>With this backdrop, he writes about “some precepts” that he lives by:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares” since the “most benevolent piece of advice can turn out badly”</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Take every gain without showing remorse about missed profits, because an eel may escape sooner than you think”. Put another way, “it is wise to enjoy that which is possible without hoping for …the persistence of luck.”</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins. At one time they may be carbuncle stones [gemstones], then coals, then diamonds, then flint-stones, then morning dew, then tears”. I guess he means investment gains are not permanent.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Whoever wishes to win this game must have patience and money, since the values are so little constant and the rumours so little founded on truth. He who knows how to endure blows without being terrified by the misfortune resembles the lion who answers the thunder with a roar, and is unlike the hind [deer] who, stunned by the thunder, tries to flee.”</p>
<p><strong>The Mind Of a Trader</strong></p>
<p>He has a keen eye on the psychology of the traders. Speculators “are very clever in inventing reasons for a rise in the price of shares on occasions when there is a declining tendency.” And “when speculators talk, they talk shares…when they look at something, it is shares that they see…But what surpasses these enormities…is the fact that the speculator…struggles against his own will …and is at odds with his own decisions…If, for example, there arrives a piece of news which would induce the speculator to buy, while the atmosphere prevailing at the stock exchange forces him to sell, his reasoning fights his own good reasons…”</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about price formation: “the expectation of an event creates a much deeper impression upon the exchange than the event itself. When large dividends or rich imports are expected, shares will rise in price; but if the expectation becomes a reality, the shares often fall; for the joy over the favourable development and the jubilation over lucky chance have abated in the meantime.”</p>
<p><strong>Bulls and Bears</strong></p>
<p>He splits traders into two classes. “The first class consists of the bulls. They start their operations by purchases…They always desire a rise in the price of the shares; they hope that by reason of good news the market will be suddenly stirred up, and that prices will rise high rapidly. The second faction consists of the bears…The bears always begin operations by sales…These bears must be fled like the plague, and one must take their part only on extraordinary occasions”</p>
<p>More colourfully, he describes them as follows:</p>
<p>“The bulls are like the giraffe which is scared of noting…They love everything, they praise everything, they exaggerate everything…the bulls make the public believe that their tricks signify wealth and that crops grow on graves…The bears on the contrary, are completely ruled by fear, trepidation and nervousness. Rabbits become elephants, brawls in a tavern become rebellions, faint shadows appear to them as signs of chaos.”</p>
<p><strong>Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it was remarkable how sophisticated the instruments available to trade were: they could trade cash markets, forwards and even options:</p>
<p>[On managing downside]: “The Dutch call the option business “opsies” a term derived from the Latin word “optio”, which means choice, because the payer of the premium has the of delivering the shares…Give “opsies” or premiums, and there will only be limited risk to you, while the gain may surpass all your imaginings…it is impossible to lose&nbsp; more than the price of the premium</p>
<p>So, looks like nothing much has changed!</p>

<p>We use software for our everyday needs because we want to get something done. We have goals to achieve and things to do.</p>
<p>The software we use is coded by brave programmers that have their own goals. Most of the time there is an overlap between their goals and ours.</p>
<p>Over time these will diverge.</p>
<p>This means that the tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand. There will be bugs in these code parts which will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>
<p>So we are at a fork in the road:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it.</li>
<li>We have the choice of trying another program, whose creator's goals are closer to ours.</li>
<li>We also have the choice of coding the software ourself.</li></ul>
<p>All but the last path mean endless seeking, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. Therefore we replace programs we do not understand fully with our own implementation.</p>
<p>The followers of the Code It Yourself Manifesto believe in these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
<li>We learn how our tools we depend on need to work.</li>
<li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li></ul>
<p>We still embrace sharing of ideas and code.</p>
<p>Sharing is only possible if we are excellent developers to each other. The next developer reading our code will be us in a not so distant future. Coding It Ourselves means we will document our code, clearly stating the goal of the software we write.</p>
<p>Together we enjoy the diversity of implementations and ideas.</p>
<p>We encourage our colleagues to</p>
<p><b>Code It Yourself.</b></p></div></div>]]>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27316166-the-effective-manager">The Effective Manager</a> says you only need 5 to 15 seconds to deliver effective feedback. Here are the 4 steps:</p>



<ol><li>Ask (“Can I give you some feedback?”)</li><li>State the behavior (“When you X…”)</li><li>State the impact (“…the result is Y.”)</li><li>Encourage effective future behavior (“Keep it up!” for positive feedback or “Can you change that?” for negative feedback)</li></ol>



<p>Those steps should be followed whether you’re giving positive or negative feedback. </p>



<p>Here’s an example, pasted from the book:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Manager</strong>: Can I give you some feedback?<br><strong>Direct</strong>: Sure, boss.<br><strong>Manager</strong>: When you tell my boss bad news before me, even with the best of intentions, I end up getting in a lot of trouble for not knowing before he did. Can you try to tell me first, going forward?</p></blockquote>



<p>Boom, done in seconds. (And if you’re thinking “but it’ll take much longer when you account for the inevitable debate about what actually happened!” then there’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/27/future-focused-feedback/">an answer for that too</a>.)</p>



<p>The beautiful thing about this rapid feedback is the frequency that it allows. When it only takes a few seconds, why not give feedback every day? Why not 5 times a day? It lowers the threshold of what is worthy of feedback.</p>



<p>One caveat: the book has a 3 question test you have to ask yourself before you can deliver the feedback:</p>



<ol><li>Are you angry? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you focused on the past instead of the future (i.e., reminding them about something they did wrong or punishing them)? If so, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>.</li><li>Are you able to let it go? If not, <em>don’t give the feedback</em>. In other words, if you can’t let it go in terms of how you feel, you <em>should</em> let it go by not giving negative feedback. If you feel an urge to deliver feedback, you’re probably doing it for the wrong reasons.</li></ol>



<blockquote><p>If you’re not angry, if it’s not about the past or about punishment, and if you can let it go, then go ahead and give the feedback.</p></blockquote>



<p>There you have it. 5 second feedback. Lower the threshold for what’s feedback-worthy and delivery a steady stream of rapid feedback every day.</p>

Damn Small Linux on a Libretto 50CT
</a></h3>
<!-- bashblog_timestamp: #202011241930.05# -->
<p>November 24, 2020 — 
Carlos Fenollosa
</p>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>In about 2004 a friend from college got into his hands a series of
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">Toshiba Libretto 50CT</a>.
They all came with Windows 95 pre installed, and we wiped them out
and installed Debian with a 2.2 kernel from floppies, with much pain because of
the unsupported disk drive. I remember it being so difficult that I
don't even want to write about it. But it booted and was able to
run Vim, Links, and connect to the internet. Enough for a
network-enabled typewriter.</p>

<p>I got Richard Stallman to sign mine while it was running GNU/Linux,
but when I bought a regular laptop I stopped using it because,
well, it is too old, and its keyboard is too tiny to type
comfortably with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto_closed.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto, closed" title=""></a></p>

<p>The Libretto, closed. It is a tiny machine, a wonderful piece of
engineering.</p>

<p>Around 2012 I found it inside a box at home, working
perfectly, with a battery life of a bit less than an hour—which is incredible for
a 12+ year old machine— and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS">DR-DOS</a> installed. I can't
remember why I did that, but
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe">Golden Axe</a> was also
installed, so there's a hint.</p>

<p>I decided to install a modern Linux and, at least, store it on a
working condition to give some justice to Stallman's signature.</p>

<p>There are some tutorials available on the net, but none of them
covered 100% of the hardware support for my machine. Most of them
are also outdated, and refer to distributions that don't exist,
don't have any support or are about unusable nowadays. However, I
took many hints from those tutorials, and I will reference them
accordingly.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>This laptop has a 75 MHz —actually, mine reports 74 MHz— with
<strong>24</strong> MB of RAM, which is an upgrade from the original 16 MB which
are usually bundled. The screen is 640x480, and if you choose a
higher resolution, instead of scaling the image, it only displays
the upper-leftmost 640x480 pixels, leaving the bottom and rightmost
part of the area out of sight.</p>

<p>The mouse device is emulated as a PS/2, and physically is a
"clitoris"-like pointing device. You know what I mean. 
Working with the X windows is a pain in the neck because the
location of the mouse and buttons isn't very ergonomic, and clicking on a button makes
the whole screen move on its hinges. </p>

<p>Next to the mouse there is a
speaker which is similar in quality to those of a modern
smartphone.</p>

<p>This device doesn't have any extension port other than a dock
connector for a dock I don't have, and a 16-bit PCMCIA slot, which
you will need for the network card. It doesn't have a COM port or
anything like that, which is understandable, given the size of the
case.</p>

<p>It does have an Infrared device, which is quite slow and useless,
but for its time it was as good as wireless could get. The other
holes correspond to the power adapter and the reset button next to
the PCMCIA, big enough to be able to reset the laptop with a
regular pen.</p>

<p>For the full specifications, please refer to
<a href="https://download.milesburton.com/Libretto/Datasheets/libretto_50_e.pdf">the official leaflet</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/libretto.thumb.jpg" alt="The Libretto" title=""></a></p>

<p>The setup I will be using: the Libretto, and a 3Com 16-bit PCMCIA
Ethernet card</p>

<h4>Choosing a Linux distribution</h4>

<p>I wanted to find some modern, low-demanding software, not
unsupported versions of Debian or RedHat. As you might have
expected by this page's title, I chose
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a> (DSL).</p>

<p>I was very lucky to find that my machine had been upgraded to 24 MB
of RAM. Apparently, even low-end distros have difficulties booting
a regular kernel with 16 MB. I didn't want to tune or recompile the
kernel on a 75-MHz machine, so I had to do some tricks.</p>

<p>In order to decide on a distro, I tried to set some goals up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discard modern distributions which require at least 256 MB of
RAM. In fact, discard anything that doesn't work with 24 MB of RAM</li>
<li>Try to avoid old versions of current distros (i.e. Debian
Woody) because the ISOs and the packages might not be mirrored
anymore and are difficult to be found.</li>
<li>Use a distro which self-configures kernel modules on boot,
because I will be installing from a Virtual Machine and the
hardware will change between reboots. Recompiling the kernel is
totally out of the picture.</li>
<li>Kernel 2.4 if possible, to make both the audio and the Ethernet
work</li>
<li>As easy to configure as possible. I want to finish this in a
few hours... [Narrator: he didn't]</li>
</ol>

<p>I found myself with these contenders,
<a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small Linux</a>,
<a href="http://puppylinux.org/">Puppy Linux</a> and
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/welcome.html">Tiny Core Linux</a>.</p>

<p>DSL v4 was the chosen one for many reasons. First, the default
software choice is a good compromise and finely tuned for
low performing machines. The installation seemed the easiest
of the three, and—very important—worked flawlessly inside
VirtualBox. The documentation is very extensive and, as a slightly
old distro, there are lots of manuals and forum posts with
solutions to common problems.</p>

<p>There is also the fact that DSL is based on Knoppix, so it detected
my hardware perfectly, didn't have to tweak the PCMCIA, and only
had to configure the audio manually because the I/O ports were not
the standard ones. This was a huge aid for me. PCMCIA Internet
working out of the box is something I hadn't even imagined to
have.</p>

<p>However, the decision also came with a few drawbacks. DSL has its
own "package manager", which only works from X and can't uninstall
packages. </p>

<p><code>apt-get</code> can be enabled, but it might break packages already installed with MyDSL.
Furthermore, those packages tend to disappear on a reboot for some reason. I'm
still unsure on whether to use apt-get with MyDSL. We will not be using it.</p>

<p>The ACPI doesn't work, but I don't know whether it's the kernel or the Libretto's
fault.</p>

<p>My biggest fear, however, is that most of the packages are old and
might have security issues. However, as this will not be my main
machine, and it won't run a browser with JavaScript enabled, I'm
not very worried.</p>

<p><strong>Why didn't I choose Tiny Core?</strong> because it didn't boot on a
VirtualBox machine with 24 MB of RAM. It would have been my first
choice, because it is better maintained than DSL. A real pity.</p>

<p><strong>And what about Puppy?</strong> The LiveCD is great but the installation
instructions were too complicated for me. I really didn't want to
spend that much time configuring everything. It is maybe too modern
(based on Slackware 13.37 with Kernel 3.1.10) and I doubt the
Libretto could have handled its kernel.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p><em>Please note: I will assume that you have some experience with Linux, partitioning, and installing stuff from a console.</em></p>

<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>

<p>There are two alternatives: use floppy disks or physically remove
the drive and set up a VM. Years ago, I went the first path,
because I had the floppy disk drive. Since I don't have it
anymore, I found
<a href="http://davissharonforest.tripod.com/DebianLinux31onToshibaLibretto50.htm">an awesome tutorial</a>
which suggested to physically remove the drive from the Libretto,
attach it to a 2.5" IDE to USB adaptor, and install the system from
another computer. Check out his pictures for details on how to
remove the drive. My machine is in a bad condition
(broken hinges, cracks all over the case, stuck screws) and I had
to break some plastics and metal parts to access the drive.</p>

<p>So, we will use another Linux computer, which you probably already
have, and set up a virtual machine inside VirtualBox. Then, we will
remove the Libretto's physical HDD and attach it via USB to your
computer, using an adapter. The DSL CD image and the new /dev/sd
will be mapped inside the VM.</p>

<p>This way we can boot and install from a CD, instead of doing
netinsts with the Debian Woody diskettes, as you will read on many
other websites. It is the fastest and painless way, and if you
don't have the floppy drive, it is the only way.</p>

<p>If you have the floppy drive and are wondering if it is worth to
buy the adapter, go ahead! Walk the
difficult path, install DOS, start a Linux setup from DOS, try to
make the floppy disk work, then install from diskettes with a
crappy kernel, fight with the PCMCIA driver until you are able to
use the network, and install from the net. And, should the
installation fail, start OVER AGAIN! When this happens, please send
me an email so that I can pretend that I sympathize with you but
actually laugh at your misery.</p>

<p>Talking seriously, I am just trying to warn you.
I tried that, I failed, then I succeeded, and not even in my
success I want even the worst of my enemies going that path. Buy it, 
then come back and follow these instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the hard drive</strong></p>

<p>You already have the adapter? Great! I bought
this one which worked great and allowed me to manipulate the drive from my
main computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter_box.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter" title=""></a></p>

<p>This is the adapter in its box. It comes with an enclosure that I
didn't use to avoid overheating, and a handy screwdriver.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.jpg"><img src="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/img/ide_adapter.thumb.jpg" alt="The 2.5inch IDE to USB adapter, close up" title=""></a></p>

<p>A close up of the IDE adapter. Don't buy a SATA one by mistake!</p>

<p><strong>Using the drive in VirtualBox</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, we will use VirtualBox to make DSL think it is
running on a real machine, and that the—now USB— hard drive is the
main drive of the VM. Turns out that using a physical disk from <code>/dev</code> on
VirtualBox isn't easy to find, but the actual command is simmple.</p>

<p><strong>Please make sure that your Linux has detected the USB drive as <code>/dev/sdb</code> before proceeding or you might lose data on the wrong disk!</strong>
If in case, use Disk Utility or check dmesg.</p>

<pre>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename disk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb
                                                                       ^^^^^^^^  &lt;-- check this
</pre>

<p>The command above will create a file named disk.vmdk, which is a
short plaintext file which references to <code>/dev/sdb</code>. You can now add
it to your VM using the normal VirtualBox Appliance Manager</p>

<p><strong>Partitioning</strong></p>

<p>Use your main Linux box to partition the hard drive. Disk Utility
works well, but I used cfdisk.</p>

<p>The tutorial then notes that the last 32MB of the disk space are
used for the Libretto's hardware Hibernate feature. I followed his
partition table suggestions completely. Just in case his page is
down, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/dev/hda1</code> 738.0 MB, <code>ext2</code> (ext3 is slower, but more secure),
mounted as <code>/</code></li>
<li><code>/dev/hda2</code> 40.3 MB, <code>swap</code></li>
<li>A remaining free space of 37.2 MB. Don't worry if the figure is
slightly higher or lower due to rounding.</li>
</ul>

  Introduction
</h2>


<p>Ketch is a very new open source <a href="https://theketch.io/">project by Shipa</a> that shares a similar concept with the Shipa DNA.</p>

<p>Ketch is heavily focused on easing out application deployments for developers, aiming for a situation where a developer does not have to write any YAML configuration files, and can directly deploy their application on any Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<p>In this post we will go through Ketch Concepts and then deploy an application to a <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100/">managed k3s cluster on Civo</a>.</p>

<p>The official definition of Ketch from Shipa is "an application delivery framework that facilitates the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes using a simple command line interface. No YAML required!"</p>

<p>This simply means that you can deploy applications onto any Kubernetes cluster by just using the Ketch CLI. But there is much more!</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying microservices and containerized applications, but there is a learning curve for a developer to get familiar with Kubernetes concepts, Kubernetes objects, how to write the required YAML files, and then how to create and manage them. These issues are there for any organization, big or small, as Kubernetes itself is complex and requires a lot of  knowledge to get up and running. Ketch works toward solving these issues by eliminating the need for writing YAML files and directly deploying applications onto a cluster.</p>

  Architecture
</h2>


<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1061.blog.png?1606373643" alt="Ketch architecture"></center>

<p>The above image is from the <a href="https://learn.theketch.io/docs/architecture">Ketch documentation</a>, and displays the architecture overview. Inside our cluster, we have a Ketch Controller, custom resource definitions (CRD) for the Pool and App, and an Ingress controller.</p>

<p><strong>Pool CRD</strong> - It's basically used to isolate different applications deployed. Each pool created will configure a namespace and other components onto the cluster.</p>

<p><strong>App CRD</strong> - Provides App context to applications and is responsible for running the application and managing its lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Ketch Controller</strong> - Monitors the changes that happen in the Pool and App CRDs. Ketch can also create a complete Helm chart for the application which can be used in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Ingress Controllers</strong> - As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports Traefik and Istio.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">
  <a href="#prerequisites"><i></i></a>
  Prerequisites
</h2>


<ul>
<li>A Kubernetes cluster you control. We'll take advantage of <a href="https://www.civo.com/kube100">Civo's super-fast managed k3s service</a> to experiment with this quickly. If you don't yet have an account, sign up to the beta now to take advantage of quick deploy times and $70 free credit per month! Alternatively, you could also use any other Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">kubectl installed</a>, and the <code>kubeconfig</code> file for your cluster downloaded.</li>
</ul>

<center><img src="https://civo-com-assets.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/content_images/1020.blog.png?1604672061" alt="Civo Kubernetes configuration"></center>

<p>Make sure you can connect to your Kubernetes cluster by running</p>

<pre><code>kubectl get nodes
</code></pre>

<p>You should see the names of the nodes in your cluster displayed.</p>

  Getting up and running with Ketch
</h2>


<h3 id="installing-ketch">
  <a href="#installing-ketch"><i></i></a>
  Installing Ketch
</h3>


<p>First the Ketch Binary has to be downloaded in order to deploy the application to our Kubernetes cluster. In this case I am installing Ketch CLI on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shipa-corp/ketch/main/install.sh | bash

Downloading Ketch binary from https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch/releases/download/v0.1.0/ketch-darwin-amd64 to /usr/local/bin/ketch
Ketch client installation was successful

$ ketch -v
ketch version 0.1.0
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ingress-controller">
  <a href="#ingress-controller"><i></i></a>
  Ingress controller
</h3>


<p>As of the writing of this guide, Ketch supports two ingress controllers, Traefik and Istio, with a plan to add more in the future. By default k3s comes with Traefik Ingress controller, which you can check using the following commands that show the pods that should include your Traefik pods, as well as the running service to manage traffic:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

<p>You can see that Traefik comes pre-installed when you spin up a k3s cluster on Civo, and serves up an external IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - If you are using a different Kubernetes cluster make sure you install Traefik or Istio from <a href="https://github.com/shipa-corp/ketch#install-ingress-controller">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ketch Requires a certificate manager to be installed onto the cluster. This can be installed via the Civo Marketplace, either on the web on your cluster management page, or with <a href="https://www.github.com/civo/cli/">Civo CLI</a>.</p>

<pre><code># Installing cert-manager via civo cli, to our cluster called "ketch"
civo kubernetes applications add cert-manager --cluster=ketch
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using a different or self-hosted Kubernetes cluster, you can install cert-manager by using the below command:</p>

<pre><code>kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.3/cert-manager.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Whichever option you choose, check that cert-manager is running:</p>

  Creating a Ketch Pool
</h3>


<p>Before deploying an app you need to create a Ketch pool. This is where we will need the external IP address of our ingress. We will get it by checking our Traefik service:</p>

<pre><code>$ kubectl get svc -A | grep traefik
kube-system    traefik-prometheus                         ClusterIP      192.168.219.19    &lt;none&gt;            9100/TCP                     93m
kube-system    traefik                                    LoadBalancer   192.168.145.176   185.136.234.146   80:32596/TCP,443:30706/TCP   93m
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we run <code>ketch pool</code> to add our pool:</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool add saiyam  --ingress-service-endpoint 185.136.234.146 --ingress-type traefik
Successfully added!
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running the above created a new namespace</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 0

$ kubectl get ns | grep saiyam
NAME              STATUS   AGE
ketch-saiyam      Active   20s
</code></pre>

<p>As of now there are 0 apps in the pool, so let's create an application</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app create hello --pool saiyam

$ ketch app list
NAME     POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                   DESCRIPTION
hello    saiyam    0        http://hello.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud

$ ketch pool list
NAME      STATUS     NAMESPACE       INGRESS TYPE    INGRESS CLASS NAME    CLUSTER ISSUER    APPS
saiyam    Created    ketch-saiyam    traefik                                                 1
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the App has 0 units as we have not deployed any app but just by creating the app, it created the endpoint automatically.</p>

<p>Now let's actually deploy an image onto the k3s cluster.</p>

<pre><code>$ ketch app deploy demo -i docker.io/saiyam911/ketch-demo
Successfully deployed!

$ ketch app list
NAME    POOL      UNITS    ADDRESSES                                  DESCRIPTION
demo    saiyam    1        http://demo.185.136.234.146.shipa.cloud
</code></pre>

<p>The application has been deployed successfully from the image provided. If we visit the address provided by the <code>ketch app list</code> command above, we should see the following:</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Ketch has created a deployment and other Kubernetes objects to expose the application. Additionally, Ketch can export your application as a helm chart which can be used to distribute your application. This is a really cool feature in my opinion, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	
	
	<img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thumb.png" alt="All Our Selves In One Basket thumbnail">
	
	

	
<p>There's a classic old idiom, "don't put your eggs all in one basket". The reasoning goes, what if the basket breaks? What if the basket isn't big enough, or gets stolen, or was cursed by a witch or something? It's important to have redundancy, to spread the eggs across many basket so that there's no one single point of failure.</p>
<p>But if we look at society, if we look at the internet, if we look at the communities we've built ourselves around... unfortunately, I believe that's exactly what a lot of us are doing. Being able to be yourself, being able to choose how you present yourself to the world, being able to tailor your living environment to your needs and desires? That's all very, very important. But if you give the keys to your self-expression and the options for the communities you belong in to one small, largely unknown group of people, that's not good.</p>
<p>In this ludicrously in-depth article, we'll be discussing how society limits both individual and community self-expression both online and offline.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The Third Place</h2>
<p><img alt="A house, labeled '1', an office complex, labeled '2', and a '3' with a question mark" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/thirdplace.png"></p>
<p>Very, very broadly speaking, a working-class person (that is, not an "owner" like a CEO, landlord, or investment banker) lives their life in three kinds of places. The first place is home. It's where you sleep, it's where you do your hobbies, it's where you have privacy and family and possibly friends if you want to invite them over. The second place is work, where you do a job to contribute to society and receive wages.</p>
<p>But clearly, we do more than that. We go to other places. Grocery stores and shops, of course, but besides that. The "third place" is where you spend your time in public, in your community. American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who came up with the concept of "the third place" in his 1989 book "The Great Good Place", defines the third place as (commonly seen as) eight characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no obligation to be here for legal, survival, political, etc. reasons. You can just <em>not show up</em>.</li>
<li>Everyone is equal. The rich, the poor, the minorities and the majorities all intermingle together in one common space.</li>
<li>Conversation and socializing is the main activity. You go here to "hang out".</li>
<li>They're accessible and accommodating for anyone who wants to visit.</li>
<li>It's a place where people regularly go, and whose regulars give the space its vibe and characteristics.</li>
<li>The physical place is not overly pretentious or imposed. It feels like <em>the community</em>, like an extension of home.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, the vibe here is more calm and friendly and playful than actively hostile and argumentative.</li>
<li>You feel like you have genuine ownership in the place, as if it's almost a communal home for you and the people you care about.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's a relatively high bar, when spelled out like that. In pandemic-era America you'd be very hard pressed to name a place like this. Offline, anyways. But this sort of pattern has shown up a lot in history, because as it turns out people <em>like</em> having a communal space to just vibe in.</p>
<h3>The Town Square</h3>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo.jpg"></p>
<p>The most obvious example in urban environments is the town square or the plaza. It's an open area in the middle of town, usually with benches and close access to shops and homes and such. Pictured is <em>La Plaza del Zócalo</em>, the main square of Mexico City. It's been a meeting spot for the people of the area since the Aztec times, an important location for numerous historical events, and significant enough to warrant its own Wikipedia page. That's really amazing for a 240 m^2 slab of concrete. What's even more amazing is that it <em>wasn't</em> always a slab of concrete. Here's a model of how it looked in 1910.</p>
<p><img alt="The Zócalo in Mexico City" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/zocalo1910.jpg"></p>
<p>It was a big park area! With a bunch of trees and benches and everything. Unfortunately, the very shaky politics of 20th century Mexico left the area in major disrepair by the 1970s, and it became that. I am not from Mexico, nor do I know anyone from the region, so I can't comment on what that did to the community in Mexico City. But as an outsider, I'd consider the 1910 Zócalo much more friendly and inviting than the modern one, which is literally a flat surface with a flagpole in the middle all surrounded by a busy road.</p>
<p>Obviously that isn't the only example. These tend to be a staple of small European and Hispanic towns. Just, a place, in your neighborhood, to go and chill. Other famous examples include the Roman Forum, the Greek Agoras, the National Mall of Washington D.C, and the "quads" or "diags" of most college campuses.</p>
<h3>Shopping Malls</h3>
<p>It is incredibly worth pointing out that town squares only make sense in urban contexts, where there's a dense population of people who live, work, and shop in one general area. The appeal of town squares is that they're basically on the way to wherever you're going, so it's a really nice spot to meet up with friends or just go if you're bored.</p>
<p>Suburbia is <em>not</em> that. Or, more accurately, it is that, <em>at the scale of the car.</em> See, America's fascination of suburban sprawl has a long detailed history to it. Paraphrasing from (imo) a very good book, "Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited" by Douglas S. Kelbaugh, the blame of sprawl can be pinned down largely on cultural reasons. First off, Americans always solved their resource and land division issues by expansion, growth, "moving out west". It was the safety valve to avoid actually thinking about difficult problems. At the time this was seen as the country's "manifest destiny", which eventually led to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQBTPY7gk">unnervingly cheery songs on children's television happily glossing over the genocide of Native Americans like it was no big deal</a>. And, heck, if we got all this elbow room, why not make everything really, really big? Big houses, big rooms, big parcels of land. And really, really cheap too, because of the glutton of natural resources. And sure, that'll get old and worn sometime, but some of the population will leave for greener pastures anyways, so there's no need to change anything.</p>
<p>So, around the early-to-mid 20th century, when cities were getting too full of colored people who were just demanding rights too loudly, most of the rich white people just up and left. They settled suburban areas outside the cities, less densely populated, with all the backyard space you need to cook out with your neighbors. And via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>, it was possible to dig very deeply a concrete "us vs. them" line in the dirt. The newfangled highway system just made it easier to separate the houses from the factories, to drive a wedge in the population. Also, just to drive the point home, federal, state, and local governments have subsidized services like sewer pipe connections, energy, and road building, often funded by taxes generated from the more urban, more productive areas.</p>
<p>An incredibly good example of this is to compare Flint and Burton, MI to the surrounding cities of Grand Blanc, Flushing, and Davison. I could spend a lot of time on this but I'd rather just do a visual comparison.</p>
<p><img alt="Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/grandblanc.jpg">
<img alt="Section of the Flint River of Flint, MI" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/flintriver.jpg"></p>
<p>It should be laughably easy to tell which one is which. (The first pic is the Fox Hill Glens of Grand Blanc, which was the first image Google gave me. The second pic is a section of the Flint River between downtown Flint and Kettering University. I took that pic during an urbex tour a few years back, because Flint was somewhat nearby and makes for <em>amazing</em> urbex pics.)</p>
<p>Where this starts to cause issues is that instead of having one core neighborhood with residential, commercial, <em>and</em> industrial areas (in a SimCity-esque model), we've split those sections into their own, largely independent areas, often harshly split on racial or class boundaries. We've got gigantic swaths of houses with maybe a corner store and a gas station, we've got giant industrial parks or office complexes, and we've got the commercial districts.</p>
<p>It's the commercial districts I really want to highlight here. If the residential areas are home, and the industrial/office parks are work, then clearly the third place is the commercial district. Now, there's two ways to approach that. </p>
<p><img alt="A strip mall" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/stripmall.jpg"></p>
<p>The most common approach is to just put a bunch of boxes next to each other, surround it with a parking lot, and call it "a strip mall". Occasionally there will also be a "big box" store, like a Wal-Mart or a Target or a Best Buy or a Kohl's or a Home Depot, either attached or detached.</p>
<p>In the very worst scenarios, you're subject to drive through the <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad">"stroad", or street-road</a>, where all the shops each have their own driveway and their own parking space and it's hostile to both people <em>and</em> cars.</p>
<p>You drive here (or take the bus, if you're poor and you're fine with the once-an-hour service), you shop, you drive home. You don't really spend time here. There is literally nothing here besides concrete boxes. And also the constant issue of cars driving past you. Hope you like sprinting across five lanes of traffic moving at 40 mph!</p>
<p>Enter Austrian-born architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Gruen">Victor Gruen</a>. After fleeing to America from the Nazis, on account of being a Jewish socialist, he slowly worked up the career ladder, from draftsman to architect. And he absolutely saw the issues of suburban sprawl. In the 1950s he gave a speech where he called the suburbs "avenues of horror ... flanked by the greatest collection of vulgarity ... ever collected by mankind."</p>
<p><img alt="The Strand Arcade in Sydney CBD, Australia, opened 1892" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/31/arcade.jpg"></p>
<p>As an alternative, he envisioned a single building, a few shops surrounded by a shared courtyard, protected from the weather. Something of an iteration of the old "arcades", like the Strand Arcade in Sydney, Australia as pictured above. The courtyard was the most substantial improvement, it was somewhere to go <em>in between</em> shopping. The arcade was just a straight hallway normally, literally just shops in a building. The shopping mall was a <em>destination</em>.</p>
<p>Victor has larger goals in mind. He expected this to be just <em>one</em> part of a new, dense, suburban community. He imagined indoor malls with housing, with schools and libraries and doctor's offices and offices, perhaps surrounded outside by high density housing or other needs. …</p></article></div>

<p>Here you can find a multi-boot uSD card image containing 17 different Pinephone distributions. 
The purpose of this image is for users to <b>easily try current major (and some minor) Pinephone Linux distributions</b>,
without having to figure out how to flash them individually and juggle with many uSD cards.

</p><p>Key points:

</li><li>Newer kernel (5.10-rc5) with 60fps fix.
</li></ul>

<h2>Quirks</h2>

<p>Most distributions don't need any patching to work with my latest 5.10 kernel and to be well behaved denizens of the multi-boot image. Nevertheless, some files still needed to be overrided. You can see those in the project's GIT repository, bellow.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>The image is distributed as a <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23.torrent">torrent</a> due to its size.
Install some torrent software (suggestions: <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">transmission</a>, <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>) and click the previous link to start the download.
Don't forget to let the torrent client run even after the download finishes so that other people can get the image too.
I only seed to the ratio of 10x at unlimited speed (1Gbit).

</p><p>The image is also available at: <a href="http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/">http://dl.xnux.eu/p-boot-multi-2020-11-23/</a> as a regular download.
 Download via HTTP is rate limited to 128 KiB/s. So if you want to get the image faster, use a torrent.

</p><p>There's also a mirror of the image by the discord user <b>uxes</b> at <a href="http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/">http://mirror.uxes.cz/dl.xnux.eu/</a>.

</p><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation consists of decompressing image data (gzipped) and to the SD card's whole block device. For example you can use <code>zcat multi.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M</code> (if you know how to identify your SD card's block device).

</p><p>Verify the image was written correctly immediately after flashing by running <code>dd if=/dev/sdcarddevice bs=1M count=10000 | sha256sum</code>.
SHA256 sum must be <code>25597ef407b4162a99ac53b144ca19227c4d15a653a4db8205eed2759c0c757d</code>.
 If your OS auto-mounts new filesystems, make sure it does not do it for the SD card image, otherwise the hash may change, and this verification method will be unreliable.

</p><p>Optionally (strongly encouraged step) you can also stretch the OS partition to fit your entire uSD card, otherwise the free space inside the filesystem will be limited to about 1.5 GiB, which is not enough for OS updates and/or longer term use of this image. If you run out of space, all included distributions may become unstable.

</p><p>Partition stretching instructions are on <a href="https://xnux.eu/log/#toc-resizing-the-partition-after-flashing-the-image">this page</a>.

</p><h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>All passwords were changed to 1111 where possible. Manjaro password is 123456. Root passwords are 1111. sxmo login/password is mo/1111.

</p><h2>Support the project</h2>

<p>p-boot demo image generator is free and opensource software released under GPLv3.
It is an independent personal project not backed by any comapny or commercial interests.

		<p>I’m grateful to learn from my daughter. Be able to see how the brain develops and picks up new concepts, skills and words. Nowadays, I enjoy to sit down and watch her play. As a parent, I also need to help her to achieve her autonomy: emotionally, mentally and physically. It is the job, and my wife and I are navigating through it. There is not a guide on how to parent, and we discuss what is working and what is not working. Sometimes is just not the time for a new skill, other times our daughter doesn’t develop an interest for a particular activity. Well, we are all different, and that is what makes the world colourful!</p>

<p>Recently I was looking at one of the structures that we created to help our daughter to achieve her autonomy:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.joaorosa.io/images/assets/2020-11-25-organisational-structures-to-create-autonomy-what-i-ve-learned-from-my-daughter.jpg" alt="A tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks"></p>

<center>A learning tower, allowing my daughter to execute her tasks</center>

<p>Yes, you are seeing it right, we have what so-called a learning tower, allowing kids to achieve higher heights. They can climb and reach the countertops, with a high degree of safety. This one is on our bathroom, and she uses it to help her with her morning routine.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-heck-is-the-relationship-to-organisational-design">What the heck is the relationship to organisational design?!</h3>
<p>I can imagine that this is the question in your head. Well, I will continue to tell the story… We built the climbing towers after she started to walk without our help. My wife saw this concept in a parenting community, and we applied it. In the beginning, we asked our daughter if she wants to be in the climbing tower, and if she said yes, we would put her there. It was a “show and tell” type of style, given that it was a new concept to her. She used it for tasks such as brush her teeth, wash her hands, watch us cook, make a beverage. You can imagine the type of tasks.</p>

<p>What I observed across time, is that the brain embraced the concept, and when we nudge her for a task, let’s say, dinner, she would go to near the tower. It is a sign that she recognises the patterns, and knows the tools that can help her achieve the goal. Lately, she is proactive: we wake up in the morning, and she goes to the bathroom, climbs the tower and asks for her toothbrush. Most of the times, we don’t need to nudge her.</p>

<h3 id="applicability-to-organisations">Applicability to organisations</h3>
<p>With this story, I hope that I sparked your imagination. The bottom line is that as a manager, in a sociotechnical system, we should create structures that help people and teams to achieve their autonomy and agency. There is a wide range of practices, rituals and tools that can help, and all of them are context-dependent. To make it tangible, let’s say that you are a company with 375 people, and you are an online photo printing solution. The solution is in the cloud, and you take care of producing and deliver the photos worldwide. You have a diverse landscape, with custom software and standard hardware (printers). We rely on partners for the logistics operations, and you have a distributed workforce across the globe, to be close to the customers. You can picture other details… As director of software, you are responsible for the custom software that your customers are delighted for.</p>

<p>You can think about different practices, rituals and tools to help autonomy and agency within the company. Let’ explore some very concreate scenarios, which I hope you can relate with.</p>

<h5 id="onboarding-of-new-colleagues">Onboarding of new colleagues</h5>
<p>A new software engineer is hired. She will join one of the teams, and as part of the onboarding process, she has the starter pack, where she can find the information about the contact person for different operations. Information such as pension and salary declarations are requested to the HR department, vacations are booked in the internal portal, or the software development process can be consulted in the wiki. There is also a public schedule of the different rituals of the teams, such as demos.</p>

<p>The starter pack allows her to have an idea about the owners of different information and processes, allowing her to be autonomous. How many times did we move between jobs and at the same move between time houses? The real state agencies require a lot of paperwork, and most of it is provided by our employer.</p>

<h5 id="communities-of-practice">Communities of practice</h5>
<p>The company is growing, and the software was a monolith, managed by two teams, is now a distributed set of services. The services are loosely coupled and operated by 15 teams. As the complexity of the system increases, the teams adopted principles of observability, and they nail logging and metrics. However, they want to invest in tracing, to increase their capabilities, and streamline the development and operations processes.</p>

<p>As such, a community of practice was created. People from different teams come together, and work on common problems, with the end in mind. It allows space to co-create, diverge and converge, experiment, until patterns and practices start to emerge, and are useful to the different teams. Other community practices can exist and be in different areas. This is not a “or” exercise, is more like a “and” one.</p>

<p>Communities of practice enable agency of teams, where they can continue to align with the organisation purpose, but devise their own way to execute their mission.</p>

<h5 id="a-new-service-is-added-to-the-landscape">A new service is added to the landscape</h5>
<p>The company is leveraging cloud services for the last 7 years, but recently they start to move their services from infrastructure-as-a-service to cloud-native, where applicable. It has an impact on the services and the way they are bootstrapped and wired. The platform team created a few templates with different goals: on one side how to migrate the services when the paradigm changes, and on the other side if you do a new service what are the barebones to bootstrap the basics (authentication, authorisation, monitoring, etc.)</p>

<p>Having these templates, a team reduce their lead time to create a new service. The templates and documentation allow them to understand how things are wired and how cloud-native can be leveraged. Once again, the teams can maintain their agency, reducing the burned over the platform team for the creation of new services. Also, there is a change for evolution, as teams can contribute to the templates, co-evolving them as new insights are generated.</p>

<h3 id="organisations-are-complex-sociotechnical-systems">Organisations are complex sociotechnical systems</h3>
<p>My goal with the examples is to provide some relatable scenarios, and I believe that stories are a great vehicle to convey a message. However, stories are context bounded, and the way that people or teams achieve something might not be feasible in a different context. Thus, my statement that ** organisations are complex sociotechnical systems**, and as a manager, we need to be aware of the complexity theory and how to navigate the inherent complexity.</p>

<p>I’m a student of complexity theory, and Cynefin, the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/snowded">Dave Snowden</a>. Cynefin framework is a sense-making framework, allowing us to make sense of the world. I will not go into the details of Cynefin, this is not the goal of the blog post, nor I’m a specialist. I’m just a student.</p>

<p>My point is that you can use Cynefin to make sense of the different needs of your organisation and help people to set-up the additional structures to create agency and autonomy. A great story that exemplifies it is “Cultivating Leadership with Cynefin: from tool to mindset” from Jennifer Garvey-Berger, Carolyn Coughlin, Keith Johnston and Jim Wicks, in the book <a href="https://www.cognitive-edge.com/cynefin-weaving-sense-making-into-the-fabric-of-our-world/">Cynefin, weaving sense-making unto the fabric of our world</a>. In this story, they show us how an organisation grow, and what were the structures that they added to allow the autonomy of the consultants, allowing their consultancy practice to evolve - a prime example of a Teal organisation.</p>

<p>Sometimes organisational structures to create autonomy and agency are not used on the spot. You need to nudge the system, observe and reflect. Sometimes the concept is new, and people and teams are getting used to it, trying to find the applicability. Other times, the structure is useless, and if that is the case just discard it. As I wrote in the beginning, our daughter got used to the learning tower, and across time increased her autonomy.</p>

<p>I hope this sparked some ideas with you. What are the organisational structures that allow autonomy and agency in your company?</p>

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

The sound ranging equipment used six tuned low frequency â€˜<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1921.0011">microphones</a>â€™</span><span> (indicated by the six parallel lines on the film) arranged in a wide arc behind allied lines. The microphones were connected to a string galvanometer at a forward listening position. A low frequency signal picked up by one of these microphones would move a thin wire in the galvanometer and cast a shadow onto a piece of moving film.</span></p><p><span>The equipment takes advantage of both the consistency and relative difference between the speed of sound and the speed of light to create a visual recording of the sound impulses which would arrive at the microphones after the flash of the guns being fired. An operator would wait for the flash of an enemy gun to start the film rolling and the equipment would record the signals as they arrived progressively based on their proximity to the impulse source. </span></p><p><span>The film took around five minutes to develop after which trained analysts could decode the patterns on the film and use them to work out the positions of enemy guns using a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_sound_ranging#cite_note-LawCosines-2">multilateration</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>By the end of WW1 sound ranging techniques could locate enemy guns within 25m to 50m under normal atmospheric conditions and even determine the <a href="https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/OrderOfBattle/Thesis/index.html">caliber, number of guns and the target</a></span><span>. &nbsp;The document above gives us a great insight into how intense and chaotic the barrage of gunfire must have been to those fighting. The missing section that has been edited out of the film in the middle of the image also begs the question â€œwhat would those 2 minutes have sounded like?â€�</span></p><p><b>Forensic sound</b></p><p><span>Using this document, the team at IWM were keen for us to try and create an interpretation of how this â€˜missingâ€™ moment might have sounded as the introduction to a series of exhibitions they were working on to commemorate the centenary of the end of the First World War.</span></p><p><span>In order to go about creating a reconstruction, we had do a bit of â€˜forensicâ€™ work, corroborating historical information about the type of artillery that would have been in use by the US, German and French armies at this point in the war, with what the visual information from the sound ranging film tells us about the size, distance and frequency of blasts and finally, interpreting the kind of reverberation you would have expected to hear by looking at landscape photographs and archive film footage from the front.</span></p><p><span>As its basis, our reconstruction uses contemporary recordings of the Howitzer, Mauser, Stokes, Vickers and Lee Enfield guns made for the purposes of sound design in film and television</span><span>. These recordings were then grouped and triggered according to who was using them and in patterns that corresponded to archive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2lGzfuJaok">newsreel</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMf5MmicGlQ">footage</a> taken at the front</span><span>. The density of the gunfire was interpreted both from the sound ranging document and further archive footage. All of these elements were mixed together relative to each other and with respect to the distances over which the fighting was taking place. Finally, a convolution reverb</span><span> with an impulse response recorded in a relative â€˜free fieldâ€™ scenario was used to simulate the space and dispersion of the sound across the front</span>.</p><p><strong>Feeling sound: bone conduction</strong></p><p><span>The team at IWM were very keen to present this unique document and our reconstruction in a way that would not only bring them to life, but also make explicit the relationship between them for visitors. With this in mind, we drew inspiration from the mechanics of the â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment itself.</span></p><figure id="attachment_1477" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1477"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg.webp 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg.webp 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="335" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder.jpg 800w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-300x225.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-768x576.jpg 768w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-450x338.jpg 450w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/800px-French_sound_ranging_recorder-225x169.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1477">A French ‘sound ranging’ system from 1920s</figcaption></figure><p><span>The â€˜sound rangingâ€™ equipment that was deployed at the end of &nbsp;WW1 used an innovative Low Frequency Microphone developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sansome_Tucker">William Sansome Tucker</a></span><span> in 1916. &nbsp;This microphone used a Helmholtz resonator to detect the physical vibrations of low frequencies of the guns in order to record them onto film</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™ and the fact that the explosions of the guns firing would have been felt as shock waves by soldiers at the same time as being heard led us to the idea of trying to incorporate bone conduction into the exhibit, as a way of tying together our reconstruction with the physicality of â€˜sound rangingâ€™.</span></p><p><strong>How does bone conduction work?</strong></p><p>Normally sound waves reach our ears as vibrations travelling through the air to our eardrums, and then on to the Cochlea or inner ear, which is connected to the auditory nerve that transmits the sounds to our brain.</p><p>However, the ear is a very sensitive organ and it can also pick up vibrations through our skulls. The most obvious example of this is when you go to the dentist and have your teeth cleaned. Dentists often use electric polishers, these polishers make a sound that can be heard in the room, but also, when applied to your teeth and transmitted through your skull, heard directly through the process of ‘bone conduction’.</p><figure id="attachment_1481" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_1481"><picture><source srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg.webp 442w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-300x205.jpg.webp 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-225x154.jpg.webp 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px" type="image/webp"><img src="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="302" srcset="https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg 442w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-300x205.jpg 300w, https://codatocoda.com/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large-225x154.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 900px, 900px"></picture><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_1481">Laurie Anderson, Handphone Table, 1978.</figcaption></figure><p>The logic of ‘bone conduction’ is that anything that vibrates can be put directly on your head and heard through your skull.

But no one did.</p><p>Is the project a failure because I have zero clients?</p><p>1 - The site only had around 4K visits so far. That's not enough.<br>2 - From those people, 99% were visits from places like Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, BetaList, etc. Are they my clients? Maybe not.</p><p>I have two big reasons to consider this a failure.</p><h3><strong>1 - I still need to put in twelve more months of work</strong>.</h3><p>To add paid newsletters, static pages, a better writing editor, a blogging experience, custom domains…. If I want to create those, I need to spend at least another 12 months. Probably more.</p><p>And for what? Adding more features is not going to help with finding clients because they won't see them.</p><h3><strong>2 - I need to find clients</strong>.</h3><p>I am sure that you can make a lot of money from a service like this. </p><p>The problem is, if I code, I can't do sales or marketing. It seems to me that there are at least 3 full-time jobs to do simultaneously, and that's too big for me.</p><p>I was naive when I started.</p><h2><strong>What was my big mistake?</strong></h2><p>I wanted to create a Micro-Saas. I wasn't looking to be a big company. I thought to have 500-1000 clients and make 10/20K per month.</p><p>I wanted to create a family business. Pay salaries for a couple of people and flying low. I wasn't looking for attention. I didn't want to be the greatest entrepreneur.</p><p>My big mistake was to think that creating a SaaS was easy. At least easier. I was expecting to have 50/100 clients in the first couple of months. I thought: "Internet is big, they will come."</p><p>And there is some truth to that, but I learned after that you need to find them. Or spend money on ads. Or both.</p><p>And I don't know how to do it, and I don't have a budget for that or the experience.</p><h3><strong>What do I mean by "I quit"?</strong></h3><p>I quit big projects that keep me attached to my desk for years and infinity hours. Projects that you can never say: done. A SaaS is never done.</p><p>Last week I created and launched&nbsp;<a href="http://slideslist.com/">slideslist.com</a>. It took me a week to create it. It had some visits and no sales, but it doesn't matter. No risks were taken and minimal effort.</p><h3>How to know if you should start a project?</h3><p>If you are starting today, you should start small. It would be best if you learn first. Start by creating a SaaS is too big and risky in time, money, and effort or even Micro-SaaS. The "micro" doesn't reflect the effort you need to put in anyway.</p><p>Create something small in less than a month and try to sell it. You will see how hard it is and how many people tell you: "nice! I will take a look later" And they will never do. So then you learn, and you keep trying small things until you have enough experience.</p><p>Even enough experience to realize that creating a SaaS is not for you. Like I learned.</p><h2><strong>Do You Need to Create a SaaS?</strong></h2><p>I’d say probably not, but I am still figuring this out.</p><p>I started this to be free. And being free involves, of course, having more money. But I don't want to buy a fancy car or a big house. You can make a lot of money from a SaaS, but there are also other ways to make money online. </p><p>The problem with the SaaS I was creating is that I was giving away my freedom by doing things that I wasn't enjoying. But I didn't want to spend every single hour of the day adding more features and at the same time trying to find clients.</p><p>If that's what you want, that's fantastic, go ahead and start a SaaS. But that's not what I wanted.</p><p>I romanticized the idea of travel and writing. And that's what I want. I wanted to make money to write, to share lessons on the things that I think are valuable for people to have a better and more balanced life.</p><p><strong>Know yourself.</strong></p><p>If I wanted to write, why was I spending my time creating a SaaS?</p><p><strong>Now I am writing, and let’s see from here.</strong></p><p>Thanks to this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-losing-38676-as-an-indie-hacker-i-cant-do-it-anymore-i-quit-8673223598">article</a>&nbsp;I published telling my story I learned that I might not have to create a SaaS to start living the life I want.</p><p>People paid me for it, and I made a good amount of money. It paid my rent for the month, and that blew my mind.</p><p>So I decided to start a newsletter and a blog and start writing about the things I enjoy. Who knows if in the future I will go back again trying to create a big project, but for now, I’m going to try something small that is also fun to do for me. </p><p>👉&nbsp;If you liked this article, share it with your friends!

                    <p>How did you end up on this page? &nbsp;If I were a betting man, I would guess that you clicked on a link posted on an &nbsp;aggregator or social media.</p><p>While I appreciate the &nbsp;click (it's always nice to see you) is this the best way to read news?</p><p>Social media and aggregators work in favor of blog posts like this. &nbsp;(And please upvote us.) &nbsp;But for news, they incentivize the wrong things. &nbsp;We know what most people want to share and what gets the most eyeballs and hard news generally is not it. (Outrage porn, anyone?) This is especially true if it is local news and only of interest to a small area.</p><p>Aggregators can give the illusion of informing: you can simply scan the headlines and go on with your day. &nbsp;After all, you just caught up on the news! &nbsp;But this is unsustainable -- smaller organizations that cover local areas are left out of lucrative licensing deals, and without click-throughs to articles, reporters and news organizations have no opportunity to display ads; leading to several generally hated internet phenomena: clickbait, overloading pages with ads, and paywalls to compensate for lost revenue.</p><p>We’re turning the current incentive structure on its head by rewarding original reporting. &nbsp; We publish concise updates from reporters you trust. We make <a href="https://www.nillium.com/newsrooms">tools for newsrooms</a> that syndicate dispatches to a consumer app instantly. (We like to think of ourselves as being to news what OpenTable is to restaurants.) And through rev-shares, our partners succeed when we do.</p><p>We also hope that this surfaces up and coming journalists. &nbsp;Local news reporters are incredibly talented, and know their communities well; even if the communities do not always know them. &nbsp;Rather than require the name recognition as a barrier to entry for a paid newsletter, we want to help them make a name for themselves, while also sharing revenue back to them. &nbsp;</p><p>This is where the news industry should be headed. We need your help -- please <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">sign up for our waiting list</a> so we can alert you when we’re live in your area, and help us bring on local publishers.</p><p>Let’s Go Forth.</p>

will not cover React fundamentals and focus on implementing login, registration
and so on.</p><p>To make things a bit easier, we will use <a href="https://expo.io/"><code>expo</code></a>. At a
minimum, you need NodeJS and NPM installed locally. We will use the ORY Kratos
React Native Login, Registration and Profile Management template:</p><div data-language="shell-session"><pre><code><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> <span>install</span> -g expo-cli</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span>expo init login-signup-app -t @oryd/expo-login-registration-template --npm</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> <span>We also want to <span>install</span> and initialize all required components:</span></span>
<span><span>$</span> <span><span>cd</span> login-signup-app</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> i</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> run expo-install</span></span>
<span><span>#</span> <span>For iOS you also need to run:</span></span>
<span>~/login-signup-app</span><span><span>$</span> <span><span>npm</span> run pod-install</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In case you want to just start exploring, simply run:</p><ul><li><code>npm start</code> opens a dashboard where you can open iOS, Android, or web.</li><li><code>npm run android</code> opens the app as an android app (requires a connected
android VM or device).</li><li><code>npm run ios</code> opens the app in the iOS simulator (works only on mac OSX).</li><li><code>npm run web</code> opens the app as a browser app.</li></ul><p><span>

<p>Yesterday I saw this tweet of Chris Campbell passing by in my timeline:</p>



<p>Aah, the memories. Quake III Arena, one of my favourite first-person shooter games.</p>

<p>Years ago, I spent (and lost) so much time playing this fast-paced game with friends and foes, and now it is brought into the world of containers and Kubernetes with <strong><a href="https://github.com/criticalstack/quake-kube" target="_blank">QuakeKube</a></strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOneTech" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>QuakeKube is a Kubernetes-ified version of</em> <a href="https://github.com/inolen/quakejs" target="_blank"><em>QuakeJS</em></a> <em>that runs a dedicated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena" target="_blank"><em>Quake 3</em></a> <em>server in a Kubernetes Deployment, and then allow clients to connect via QuakeJS in the browser.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t wait to give it a try, especially after reading the documentation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Container images are being cross-compiled with</em> <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/" target="_blank"><em>Docker Buildx</em></a> <em>so it can run on hardware with different architectures and operating systems. Currently, it is building for <code>linux/amd64</code> and <code>linux/arm64</code>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>ARM64 support!</strong> Great, it means I can run it on one of my Raspberry Pis!</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-fragging">Let’s get fragging!</h2>

<p>Most of the work is already done by others, so with the proper tools and projects, it will take you only a few minutes to get everything up and running.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
<li>a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04, which supports arm64<br></li>
<li><code>k3sup</code>, a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.<br></li>
<li><code>arkade</code>, a simple Golang CLI with strongly-typed flags to install charts and apps to your cluster in one command.<br></li>
<li><code>kubectl</code><br></li>
<li>a DigitalOcean account and an API Token</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>First, install <code>k3s</code> on your Raspberry Pi running a arm64 OS like Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ k3sup install --ip <span>192</span>.168.0.52 --user ubuntu --k3s-extra-args <span>'--no-deploy servicelb --no-deploy traefik'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the installation of k3s on the Raspberry Pi, k3sup also downloads the required kubeconfig file in your current working directory.<br>
Make sure to configure <code>kubectl</code> to use this config file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ export KUBECONFIG<span>=</span><span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/kubeconfig</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, install the inlets-operator with <code>arkade</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ arkade install inlets-operator --provider digitalocean --token-file ~/do-api-token</code></pre></div>
<p>The inlets-operator will create an inlets exit-node on DigitalOcean, giving the LoadBalancer services in the private k3s cluster a public IP address.</p>

<p>As clients connect to the server via QuakeJS in the browser with websockets, the OSS version of inlets will do just fine. If you want to have better support for TLS etc, I can highly recommend having a look at inlets PRO version.</p>

<p>Finally, take the example yaml file from the QuakeKube GitHub repository and make the appropriate changes. The service should be updated to a LoadBalancer instead of type NodePort, and of course you can change the configuration to tweak the game preferences to your own needs.</p>

<p>Example of a QuakeKube yaml file:</p>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>As we are talking about an image <i>file</i>, it comes natural to store it on the traditional <b>filesystem</b>. Unfortunately, traditional filesystems don't support transactions. Getting the security aspects right is hard. It's a challenge to make consistent backups given that you can't just stop the world. Inevitably, a traditional filesystem will be modified while you are working on the backup. Sooner or later this will cause problems.</p><p><b>Databases</b> can solve all of the above. They have transactions. If you do a backup, it will likely be consistent by default. The problem is, databases are bad with large objects. They are a bad choice if you want to serve lots of users.</p><p>This is really frustrating. Why can't we have a storage system that combines the best of both worlds?</p><p>I want this:</p></div>

<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-7"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The problem space is cut along the wrong dimensions</h2><p>Let's take a step back and look at the big picture. This is how the problem space for storing data is currently divided:</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The problem space should be divided along <i>conflicting requirements</i>.</p><p>For <b>example</b>, storing ice cream and fruits have conflicting requirements. Ice cream has to be frozen while freezing directly harms fruits. Ice cream requires below zero temperatures while fruits require above zero temperatures. That's a hard conflict. <i>They require different storage solutions.</i></p><p>The thing is, traditional filesystem and database features have no conflicts. Or tell me a single feature that requires:</p><ul><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>hierarchy</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the <i>lack of </i><b>large object</b> support,</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>transaction</b> support, or</p></li><li><p>the<i> lack of</i> <b>structured data</b> support.</p></li></ul><p>There is none.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Controlled changes</h3><p>Some data of the website must be controlled, that is, only changed by the website's owners. This includes the codebase, the page structure, blog post contents, some assets like images and videos or even highly structured data like product features. Such data shall not be changing in the production environment<a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> as that would mean your visitors see work-in-progress changes that may even break the website temporarily.</p><p>Controlled data shall be edited in <b>development environments</b> which shall be clone-able from the production environment. It often requires <b>version control</b> and <b>non-linear development</b> (branching and merging). Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state should<i> replace</i> the old state.</p><h3>Uncontrolled changes</h3><p>On the other hand, there are changes that simply <i>can not be controlled</i>. This includes user contributions like comments and webshop orders. It includes changes made by automatically executed scripts, for example one that resets counters at midnight. It shall include logs generated while serving requests.</p><p>Uncontrolled data consists of <b>linear, sequential changes</b> thus it requires linear snapshots not non-linear feature branches. When cloning the production environment for development purposes, uncontrolled data will typically need to be cloned as well thereby giving you complete freedom to try anything without a complex setup process. This also helps reproducing bugs in minimal time. Upon shipping a new version of the codebase to the production environment, the new state of uncontrolled data shall be typically <i>dropped</i> to prevent accidentally overwriting changes made in production.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>The Boomla Filesystem</h2><p>Most websites and web apps need both a controlled and an uncontrolled storage area.

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h3>Eliminating global data</h3><p>We have addressed how to have a hierarchy of objects everywhere, even on the dynamic filesystem but if we store it as a separate filesystem tree, we are back to square one: a global shared namespace. Instead, what we need is the ability to <i>attach</i> dynamic volumes anywhere on the static filesystem, like so:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/dynamic-volumes-attached-to-the-static-filesystem.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=cb5a4070bc6&amp;width=1024" alt="Dynamic volumes attached to the Static Filesystem"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-21"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>The <i>existence</i> of these dynamic volumes must be version controlled but their contents must not be as they are constantly changing. They must be somehow stored on the dynamic filesystem instead.</p><p>Let's see an <b>example</b>. Imagine a comments element embedded into a page. It shall have its own dynamic volume with its own schema. The existence of the comments element must be version controlled but not the actual comments. They can't be: they would cause continuous merging issues.</p><p>Removing either the comments element itself (or even the page it is embedded in) must remove the comments element itself with all associated user comments. In the traditional setup, you would have to write lots of code yourself to figure out what data needs to be removed. This takes time (money) and may be non-trivial when there are several 3rd party plugins installed. With proper encapsulation, the system can automatically do this for you.</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><div><p>So here is how this works. Boomla files have a <i>link</i> property. You can attach a dynamic volume anywhere on your website's filesystem by simply setting the file's link property to <code>dynamic</code>.</p></div></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/the-underlying-structure-of-embedded-dynamic-volumes.png"><p><img src="https://cdn.boomla.net/v2.0/boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/the-underlying-structure-of-embedded-dynamic-volumes.png?height=1024&amp;o1-cache=2c2c8bfd096&amp;width=1024" alt="The underlying structure of embedded dynamic volumes"></p></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-25"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><p>By doing so, the system will create a new volume on the hidden dynamic filesystem and map it to the linking file. (Using the linking file's file ID.) From that point on, you will be able to write the dynamic subtree as usual. It will appear as if it was part of your website's filesystem tree.</p><p>That way, in Boomla, deleting the page holding the comments will <i>also remove the actual comments</i>.</p><p>The root volume of the dynamic filesystem is hidden by design, it's not directly accessible. If you are interested, see the <a href="https://boomla.com/docs/how-it-works/anatomy-of-the-boomla-filesystem/file-link/dynamic-link">dynamic link docs</a> for more details.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div data-o1-path="//boomla.com/blog/filesystem-and-database-are-not-cutting-the-problem-space-right/main/text-19"><div>




<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Undo, redo</h2><p>One of the really powerful features of the Boomla Filesystem is that undo/redo is available for the entire website. It <i>makes</i> us experiment. We can try things, we can fail and we can always undo. It's a huge boost to <i>dare to try</i>.</p><p>The great news is, <b>undo/redo will still be available</b> when collaboration is enabled.</p><p>There is a little caveat though. In the <b>production environment</b> you may have multiple users making changes. You definitely don't want to accidentally undo a comment or an order made by someone else. Plus in production, the static filesystem is read-only as you probably don't want your visitors to see your work-in-progress. Because of this, undo/redo is not available in the production environment (master branch).</p><p>Once you clone the production environment and thus create a <b>development branch</b>, undo/redo will be available for your entire website. Changes made to the static and dynamic filesystems are bundled in a single atomic transaction, creating a single undo point. That way, whatever changes you make, you will be able to use undo/redo.</p><p>To rephrase, you either don't have undo/redo at all (master branch) or you have undo/redo for your entire website (secondary branches).</p></div>

<div data-o1-contenteditable="body" data-o1-contenteditable-format="html"><h2>Users, Access Control, Security</h2><p>Using a traditional filesystem and database poses another problem with access control.</p><p><b>Access control can only be enforced in a layer that has access to both users and data.</b> It's just impossible otherwise. Websites and web apps introduce their own user concepts. As a result, they should take over all access control responsibilities. Data access should only happen through a single, well defined layer.</p><p>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Both databases and the underlying OS have their own user concepts with their own means of doing access control. Plus your chosen CMS or framework has its own user concept and access control mechanisms. Application developers have access to all of them. They have to call all the right functions themselves to make sure everything is secure. Every application developer has to be a security expert and not make mistakes.</p><p>If you are wondering how this could possibly be secure - don't worry, it isn't. <b>It's a complete disaster.</b> (Pro tip: make your competitors use this.)</p></div>

<p>There’s a fantastic article from last year titled <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, don’t validate</a>. I’d highly recommend it to any programmer (along with the more recent follow up <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/">Names are not type safety</a>). The basic idea is that there are two ways to check that some input to a function is valid:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>validator</em> checks that the input is valid and throws an error if not. It doesn’t return anything. For example, checking that a list is not empty. </li><li>A <em>parser</em> does the same as a validator, but returns a more specific representation of the input that ensures that the required property is satisfied. For example, checking that a list is not empty and <em>returning a NonEmptyList type</em>. </li></ul>



<p>The thesis of the article is that parsers are preferable to validators. If you’ve not read the original article, please do so – it’s very well written and makes the case much better than I can summarise it. The essential message is to <em>make illegal states unrepresentable</em>. In the article, this is done by making use of the type system. This is a philosophy I entirely agree with, but I want to point out and expand upon one ironic aspect of the argument:</p>



<p><strong><em>A type checker is a paradigmatic example of a validator!</em></strong></p>



<p>A type checker, after all, takes as input an already parsed program representation and rejects it if it fails to type-check. It doesn’t return a more specific representation of the program. (Not to be confused with <em>type inference</em>, which does return more information, but only about the types). </p>



<p>So what would be the parser alternative to a type checker in a programming language? One approach would be to actually create a more specific grammar that eliminates illegal states. For example, if a given function requires a number that must be between one and five, then rather than having a generic syntax for function calls such as:</p>



<pre>fun_call ::= fun_name ‘(‘ integer ‘)’</pre>



<p>You would instead define specific grammar rules for the functions you provide:</p>



<pre>one_to_five ::= 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5<br>fun_call ::= ‘lil_fac(‘ one_to_five ‘)’<br>         | ... other function definitions ...</pre>



<p>Creating such specific grammars is one approach to crafting <em><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">domain-specific languages</a> </em>(DSLs). And indeed, DSLs are a great way of ensuring that illegal states aren’t representable. Of course, this is not a scalable solution if you want to make a general-purpose language with user-defined functions.</p>



<p>An alternative to having a very specific grammar is to instead <em>raise the level of abstraction</em>, so that it is easier to avoid invalid states. For example, a common source of programming errors is out of bounds indexing into arrays. This occurs because the programming language only offers a primitive indexing operation: <code>a[x]</code>. Here “x” is an integer but might be out of bounds, resulting in an exception or crash (if you’re lucky). One way we could prevent this would be to define a more specific type of “integers between zero and 12” so that the type system rejects any potentially invalid indexing operations, and then track this more precise type for each array — validation again. </p>



<p>A different approach would be to notice that there are typically a few common ways that you want to use an array and provide specific abstractions in the language that capture those uses. For example, it’s very common to want to iterate through the array performing some kind of calculation. Rather than making everyone manually write out the for-loops for doing this — do arrays in this language start at 0 or 1? Do they stop at array.length or array.length – 1? Do array indexes have a specific type? — you could instead offer a general <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/fold.pdf">fold </a>(reduce) operation. Likewise, instead of making people write their own hashtables you could provide one built-in to the language itself. By providing better abstractions you make it less likely that programmers will hit illegal states. </p>



<p>You can then go further and <em>remove</em> the more primitive operations, only allowing access to the higher level abstractions. Hopefully in 2020 most programmers would agree that removing goto statements in favour of higher level structured programming abstractions was a win, and the same can be true of other low-level constructs: nulls, raw memory pointers, etc. </p>



<p>In the world of computer security, there is a direct analogue of this discussion. The security model of most computer systems allows a separation between operations I <em>can</em> (try to) perform and operations I am <em>allowed</em> to perform: I can try and delete your website, but (hopefully) the request will be rejected as unauthorized. In contrast, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability systems</a> my ability to even invoke such an operation depends upon me holding an unforgeable c<em>apability </em>granting me permission to perform it. It’s not possible to even attempt an operation that I am not allowed to perform. For example, in a REST API using <a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2019/01/16/can-you-ever-safely-include-credentials-in-a-url/">capability URIs</a>, I cannot simply send a DELETE request to /users/alice, but instead need to send it to some unguessable random URI – if I don’t already have that URI then I can’t even begin to send the request. Object-capability security therefore aims to make <em>unauthorized states unrepresentable</em>. </p>



<p>Perhaps the most widely known embodiment of the object-capability paradigm is the <a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>: a <em>dynamically-typed</em> object-oriented programming language. Although now somewhat abandoned, it is a fascinating language with a lot of great ideas. E uses strong abstraction boundaries to ensure security. Be warned: the E website is a rabbit hole of incredible depth!</p>



<p>In my twenties, I used to do a lot of programming in <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">Tcl</a>. A language that most would agree is about as far removed from a modern statically typed programming language as you can get. (Often pointed out with something close to utter disgust). And yet the idea of making illegal states unrepresentable was entirely natural to myself and other Tcl programmers. I would frequently start a programming project by creating a <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/interp.htm#M12">blank-slate interpreter</a>, stripping out all the built-in language constructs (<a href="http://nsl.com/">loops</a>, procedures, even <a href="https://tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/expr.htm">arithmetic</a>), and then adding back in a carefully selected set of high-level domain-specific primitives. This DSL would then become the application’s configuration file, safe in the knowledge that illegal configurations cannot be expressed. </p>



<p>To summarise, my point is not that type systems are bad or that the original essay is flawed. On the contrary, I thank the flying spaghetti monster almost every day for the type system in my day job (and that is only Java’s tepid concoction), and I think the “parse, don’t validate” essay is excellent. But the last two decades have seen such advances in type systems and the adoption of typeful programming patterns that we are in danger of thinking that type systems are the only way of achieving correctness in software construction. They are a tremendously powerful tool, but more basic techniques of abstraction and information hiding can be just as powerful. The goal of making illegal states unrepresentable should be one of the defining goals of software engineering, but there are many valid ways to crack that nut.</p>



<p><em>Shameless plug: I discuss capability URIs in depth in chapter 9 of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/api-security-in-action">my book on API security</a>, just published by Manning. I also discuss using types to enforce security properties in chapter 6. </em></p>

<p>Who’s got two thumbs and shipped her first of <a href="https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/">12 startups in 12 months</a> <em>on schedule</em>? That’s right, this girl.</p>

<p>In its first week, the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 reached $5K in revenue through
a combination of lifetime deals, subscriptions, and my first ever Bitcoin transaction (thanks, Nico!).</p>

<p>A profitable first week isn’t what makes this a success in my book.</p>

<p>I’m <em>thrilled</em> at all the cool members who decided to join.
Exactly as I’d hoped, each person adds something unique and interesting to the community,
and I’m really excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my first monthly retrospective.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be sharing a behind-the-scenes look at the first week of my paid community launch
and reveal what I’m shipping in November.</p>

<p>Below you’ll discover charts, graphs, screenshots, strategy, reflections, and my master plan
for growing Blogging for Devs through viral, generated content 🔮</p>

<p>I promise, it’s good.</p>



<p>First question: Did I really?</p>

<p>Before talking about what I’ve been up to in October, it’s important to
get on the same page about this:</p>

<p><strong>Even though I began charging to join the community this month, the community
itself was launched as a sort of “closed beta” back in July.</strong></p>

<p>The newsletter that helped me connect with first 100 free members (and most of the
paid members — more on that later) was launched in May.</p>

<p>You know what they say about overnight success.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s what and how I launched in a month.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-community-preview-image.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Pro Community"></p>

<p><a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" alt="Blogging for Devs Community (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs Community</a>
 is a paid
community for developers, makers, engineering managers, and technical founders to grow their blogs
through feedback, collaboration, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>We have accountability groups, virtual events and workshops, members-only resources and original content,
and most importantly — super kind and knowledgeable members.</p>

<p>For the first 250 people to join, it costs $12/month, $96/year, or $180 once.</p>

<p>The discussions are powered by <a href="http://circle.so/" alt="Circle (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Circle</a>
 and rocking
a custom theme I hacked together through highly specific CSS selectors and
vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/circle-code-snippets.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they say you only need to know React these days 😝</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It integrates with the Gatsby website through a custom OAuth provider, which uses Firebase
for authentication. It’s all serverless and cloud native and such.</p>

<p>In October, I built Events, a member RSS feed, signup, payment, the landing page, onboarding, profiles, welcome email sequence,
and a lean batch of starter content. I designed everything myself in Figma. For more granular detail on building the product,
you can see the day-to-day in my <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1315678202988244993" target="_blank">twitter thread</a>.</p>

<p>Enough about tech, let’s talk launch.</p>

<p><img src="https://bloggingfordevs.com/images/bfd-pro-screenshot-2.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community"></p>

<h2 id="success-metrics-why-you-won-t-find-an-overall-conversion-rate-in-this-report">Success metrics: Why you won’t find an overall conversion rate in this report</h2>

<p>My real goal for the community was to get
great people in, and not to overly optimize for converting anyone with a pulse.</p>

<p>That’s why my biggest launch fear wasn’t that no one would sign up.</p>

<p>It was that people I <em>don’t like</em> would sign up. Spammers, self-promoters, attention-seekers,
jerks.
Thankfully it hasn’t been the case and everyone is awesome so far 🤞</p>

<p>I try to scare those types away with a prominent Code of Conduct and an “Is this right for you?” checklist.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-checklist.png" alt="Vanilla JavaScript"></p>

<p>That’s why I have no idea what my “conversion rate” for the community is and I don’t actually care.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> pay attention to the opt-in rate for my free newsletter, though, so don’t take this as, “Girl doesn’t care about metrics.”</p>

<p>I care about metrics, just <em>not</em> on the community landing page.</p>

<p>The reason is, joining a community is a long-term thing.
Something like this often takes time and multiple exposures for people
to make the decision — it was the same for me and <a href="https://rosie.land/" alt="Rosieland (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Rosieland</a>
 and <a href="http://trends.co/" target="_blank">Trends</a>.</p>

<p>The more interesting question is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I can I learn about the members who did sign up, so I can find more people like them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that, it’s chart time 👯‍♀️</p>



<p>Were paying members wooed by my slick landing page, or convinced by
a carefully crafted tweet?</p>

<p>Turns out, probably not.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-members.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Member Attribution"></p>

<p>Most new members were already subscribed to <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank">my free weekly newsletter</a> about blogging for developers, which is about 4,000 subscribers strong.</p>

<p>Every Friday for nearly six months, I’ve been sending out original content about
blogging, SEO, going viral, attracting an audience, and a splash of motivational moments. It takes me an entire day to write.</p>

<p>Out of 69 new paying members in the first week, <strong>only three were
unattributable</strong> at least one of three sources:</p>

<ol>
<li>Waitlister</li>
<li>Newsletter Subscriber</li>
<li>Twitter Follower</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-channels.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Paid Community Launch Channels"></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Newsletter backstory:</strong> I started the newsletter in May, and it’s since grown to over 4,000 subscribers. If you want to know how, check out the writeups I’ve done <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/launch-a-newsletter/" alt="here (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">here</a>
 and <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/product-hunt-launch/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people had multiple touchpoints: subscriber <em>and</em> on the waitlist, or followed me on twitter
<em>and</em> subscriber to the newsletter.</p>

<p>However, only <strong>31% of new members follow me on Twitter</strong>. I’m not offended, to the contrary —
I prefer it.</p>

<p>Now I know that if I want to grow the community, the best thing I can do
is have more of the right people <strong>join the newsletter first</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why my goal is to grow the newsletter, and trust that the community
will eventually benefit from the best subscribers joining up.</p>

<p>Let’s take a dip into revenue for a second.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-and-where-did-revenue-come-from">How much and where did revenue come from?</h2>

<p>As I said in the <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1325008065041666049" alt="tweet (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">tweet</a>
 where I collected ideas for this article, the $5K revenue is <em>not</em> MRR (monthly recurring revenue).</p>

<p>MRR for the Blogging for Devs Community is just $516 according to Stripe.</p>

<p>So where did the first week’s $5K in revenue come from?</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-launch-revenue.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Revenue"></p>

<p>Someone on Twitter recently asked me if I have any “thought leadership”
to spare on the topic of <strong>lifetime pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t.</p>

<p>Guess what, I’m neither optimizing for conversion nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" alt="LTV (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">LTV</a>
 🙃</p>

<p>Offering a lifetime price at a lower cost than 2 years as a member is
really just a way for me to say “Thank you” to people who are in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>I see it as a mutual commitment.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-sustainable-yet">Is this sustainable yet?</h2>

<p>You might see $5K in a week and think it sounds like a lot of money. If only one
could extrapolate that to $20k/mo, then I’d be set.</p>

<p>But of course, it’s not the whole picture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taxes and healthcare are super expensive here in Germany</li>
<li>I already spend over $300/mo on SaaS tools to run the community</li>
<li>Only $500 currently recurs monthly, assuming zero growth/churn</li>
</ul>

<p>Still, I have a <strong><em>very</em> long way to go</strong> before the community is sustainable.</p>

<p>That’s why my November startup is a side project to scale reach of the newsletter,
which should <em>in turn</em> drive the growth of the community.</p>

<p>I think marketers would call this a “funnel”.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/community-funnel.png" alt="Blogging for Devs Community Funnel"></p>

<p>I think about it a little more like concentric circles approaching a core.</p>

<p>My next task is to expand the outermost ring with the kind of people who are
likely to join and enjoy the newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="my-master-plan-for-growing-blogging-for-devs-beyond-twitter-and-word-of-mouth">My master plan for growing Blogging for Devs beyond Twitter and word of mouth</h2>

<p>Channels die. Or at least, they become exhausted.</p>

<p>Although people still write me emails saying they’ve been following for
years, and just found out I have a newsletter — most of that is probably in the past.</p>

<p>People who know me, know about Blogging for Devs.</p>

<p>I really don’t want to spend all day on Twitter “growing my social media presence”.
I’d rather be building cool shit and helping other people build cool shit, too.
Let people find me through that.</p>

<p>Right now, word of mouth is what grows the newsletter.</p>

<p>Random mentions and links.  I find out through welcome emails or through
stalking my backlink reports from time to time.</p>

<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/newsletter-replies.png" alt="Lala"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do reply to everyone who emails me, but I was running a bit behind
after spending the prior week following the US election 🙈</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On average, I gain about 5-10 subscribers per day.</p>

<p>A prominent mention on Twitter, Indie Hackers, or the success of a subscriber’s
blog post can push than number over 100.</p>

<p><strong>The problem? Today, word of mouth isn’t sufficient to grow the newsletter quickly enough to reach sustainability in the near term.</strong></p>

<p>Ironically, I’m also a blogger with no spare time to grow it writing a ton of individual blog posts 😅</p>

<p>So how can I grow my newsletter about blogging, without blogging <em>myself</em>,
and without relying on Twitter for all my traffic?</p>

<p>Here comes the master plan. I hope it works.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-ll-build-traffic-to-blogging-for-devs-while-writing-virtually-no-blog-posts">How I’ll build traffic to Blogging for Devs (while writing virtually no blog posts)</h2>

<p>I have a theory. Well, I have a few theories.</p>

<p>The first one is this: Developers want to discover blogs written by other developers.
Reading company engineering blogs is fine, but quality content from their peers or individuals
they admire is far more interesting.</p>

<p>Most places to discover developer content feature individual articles. Hacker
News, Reddit, and Twitter all fundamentally work this way.</p>

<p>But what’s more interesting is the person behind the blog. Their personality, what makes them unique,
inspiring, and worth following in their own right.</p>

<p>To back this up, I present Exhibit A.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Tech Twitter:</p><p>What is your NUMBER ONE favorite blog by someone in tech, who has a <em>distinct writing style</em>? Where you read their articles for their <em>unique personality or voice</em>?</p><p>(Pls no list of twitter handles, direct link to the blog is 👍)</p></div>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1299054522074005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Apart from the fact that asking for any kind of recommendation on Twitter is a
one-way ticket to pandemonium, you can tell from the replies that
people feel strongly about the topic. 400+ responses.</p>

<p>When I build something, I like that the topic evokes a response like this.</p>

<p><strong>It means people care.</strong></p>

<p>Extension of the theory (this time with less evidence): Many people who read
amazing tech blogs also aspire to create one themselves.</p>

<p>Ergo, if I create a place for people to discover the best developer blogs,
there’s a good chance people who show up will like my newsletter, too.</p>

<p>So here’s my plan.</p>

November 26, 2020 | http://blairreeves.me/2020/11/25/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-lessons-learned/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://blairreeves.me/2020/11/25/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-lessons-learned/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Back last winter – in the beforetimes, as they say now – I did a lot of thinking about how I could be most politically impactful in this election cycle. What I landed on was fundraising focused on my state legislature here in North Carolina. <a href="http://blairreeves.me/2020/08/31/thoughts-on-fundraising/">I wrote a blog about it</a> – one of the few I’ve gotten around to writing this year – and promised a follow-up on what I learned about the nuts-and-bolts of indie political fundraising. So here is that follow-up.</p>

<p>When I launched the <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">Long Leaf Pine Slate</a> in January of 2020, I figured I might be able to raise a few thousand dollars from family and friends. Not much, but something. We wound up doing a lot more than that. “The Slate” caught fire, and over the course of the year, became <i>the largest independent channel of funding based in the state</i> to Democrats running for the North Carolina state legislature. We raised more than $300,000 from over a thousand donors for a small group of our most strategic Democratic candidates running against vulnerable Republican incumbents.</p>
<p>That may not sound like much if you’re used to reading about Senate races which raise tens of millions. But at the state legislative scale, that’s actually very big money. Here’s some comparison to give you a sense of scale:</p>

<p>If the Long Leaf Pine Slate were a PAC, we’d have been the third-largest in the state and the single largest donor to Democrats based in North Carolina. Better: all of that money went to just a small group of our most important races. We raised almost as much money for those select Democrats as Duke Energy – basically the evil empire of right-wing power in North Carolina – gave to Republicans. (Directly, anyway. More on that later.)</p>
<p>The Long Leaf Pine Slate was nothing but <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">a website</a> that linked to an ActBlue fundraising page featuring our candidates and <a href="https://twitter.com/forwardcarolina">a Twitter account</a>. When donors gave, every dollar thus went directly to our candidates’ campaigns, nowhere else. The Slate was not, itself, a PAC – meaning we didn’t touch any money. You could not, for example, write a check to the Long Leaf Pine Slate. We didn’t even have a bank account. It was a 100% volunteer project.</p>
<p>Something similar to this – a no-nonsense ActBlue fundraising slate for state legislative candidates – should exist in every state. If you’re reading this, maybe you should start one, or join up with others who are. The purpose of this blog is to offer up some lessons learned, and maybe – just maybe – convince you, dear reader, that you can do this too.</p>
<h2>Why this model works</h2>
<p>An ActBlue fundraising page literally takes every dollar that is contributed and just slices it up among the campaign recipients you list. If there are ten campaigns listed, then each gets 10 cents. It’s that simple. What you see is what you get.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned PACs and parties act as intermediaries between a donor and the campaigns that need their money, and this causes lots of problems. Unfortunately, both (but particularly PACs) tend to be incredibly inefficient ways for donors to help the good guys, and wind up spending lots of money on things other than getting candidates elected. Very, very few people who give to PACs or parties ever actually look at the disclosures to see where their money went. Without naming names, I have been personally disappointed when I actually saw the spending disclosures from progressive PACs that I thought were good, but turned out to be big money-furnaces for politicos to get paid. (Caveat: yes, there are some good PACs too. They’re just rarer than you’d think.)</p>
<p>Besides its transparency, another large advantage of the ActBlue model is it allows organizations to raise substantially more money per candidate. If we’d been a PAC, we would’ve been limited to giving $5,400 per endorsed candidate – the legal maximum in North Carolina. But in the ActBlue model, <i>we’re</i> not the donor – in a way, we’re just pointing the actual donors to a list of candidates and saying, “these are the folks to give to.” So when you get lots and lots of folks giving money through that page, and each one can give up to the legal limit, it really adds up. ActBlue allows you to see just how much folks have given through your page, which is how we know the Slate raised so much money, almost entirely from folks who never would’ve found our candidates otherwise.</p>
<p>Fun fact: unlike the PACs, the Long Leaf Pine Slate is completely invisible on NC campaign finance reports. All the reports show is the donors, not the online channel they used. This keeps the Republican oppo researchers guessing and the media clueless. But the candidates know very well, because their ActBlue candidate dashboards show exactly what fundraising pages their money is coming from.</p>
<p>Legal stuff: every state is different, but this model is perfectly compliant everywhere I’m aware of. In North Carolina, there are certain conditions where you need to establish a political committee to promote candidates for office – like if you spend much money doing it. We thus had a (very, very low) spending limit for this project. This is the reason for the Slate’s <a href="http://longleafpineslate.org/">extremely basic webpage</a> – it’s literally just a hardcoded HTML file sitting on AWS. Dirt cheap! (I had lots of folks write in offering their help to create a much fancier webpage. This was very generous, but I could do that too. It’s basic because we couldn’t afford to do something nicer. I’m not kidding when I said our spending limit was low.)</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate/the-long-leaf-pine-slate-44e6abc51318">this explanatory post</a> about the Long Leaf Pine Slate that covers why raising money matters, why it’s hard for most candidates, and why that difficulty enables a lot of corporate corruption in our politics.</p>
<h2>What we did</h2>
<p>After I built the website and set up the ActBlue page, I knew that making a splash on social would be vital to winning eyeballs and attention for the Slate. So pre-launch, I begged a lot of big-audience folks on Twitter for retweets. Believe me, it felt as cringeworthy as it sounds. But incredibly, some obliged, including <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonkander">Jason Kander</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers">Bakari Sellers</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjacksonnc/">Jeff Jackson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintSmithIII">Clint Smith</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer">Dan Pfeiffer</a> and several more. The initial pop sent a lot of traffic and eyeballs on the project, and a little money. It made a difference. (Over time, I noticed that social eyeballs were good for traffic, but not so much for money.)</p>
<p>But what really made the Slate grow was just flogging it relentlessly every day. It was honestly a real grind. I sent hundreds of cold emails. (Didn’t work.) I promoted the Slate on Twitter, explaining why it was important. (Kinda worked.) <a href="https://medium.com/@longleafpineslate">I blogged about it</a> (useful for inbound traffic, sometimes for money).</p>
<p>What I found was that successfully fundraising requires you to be needy, persistent and a little bit pushy. Very, very few people will ever volunteer to give you money. You have to ask. And the vast majority of people you ask (directly or not) will say no. And just like in a job interview, you can’t take it personally. (If I cold emailed you and asked for money, sorry!) Asking for money sucks. I don’t like it and I don’t think anyone else does, either. But doing so for a good cause makes it a little easier, and over time, I got used to it.</p>
<p>I just kept doing this all year. Call it a “hustle” or “bootstrapping” or whatever you like, but slowly and gradually, folks started paying attention. We started raising more money. A real audience began to develop. I started writing <a href="https://thelongleafpineslate.substack.com/">email updates</a> to our donors, and those were a hit. Our list grew.</p>
<p>Speaking of email, another fun fact: as a fundraising page owner, ActBlue gives you the ability to ask your donors whether they want to share their email addresses with the recipient campaigns or not. I enabled this, so that every contributor to the Slate got to choose. The Slate still gets your email address, but whether recipient campaigns do was up to you. I now have a rather large donor list, and I made everyone a promise: the Slate will never, ever share or sell your email. It’s just not a deal I’m interested in. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I knew we must be doing something right when Republican spies started sniffing around. I started getting emails from “supporters” I didn’t recognize, from obviously fake email addresses, asking for recordings from candidate calls. (<a href="https://americarisingpac.org/about/">America Rising</a> lackeys, I see you!) The Slate works in public, so this was fine – a vote of confidence if nothing else.</p>
<h2>So, what happened?</h2>
<p>I won’t bury the lede here: we still lost many of the races we backed.</p>
<p>So was this all a failure? Nah. The money mattered. But as I always remind people, money is just ammunition. It doesn’t buy races. We were able to raise money early in the cycle, which mattered a lot for our candidates. (For a campaign, $1 in October is worth $5 in January.) We funded candidates in “frontier” districts, where the fundamentals were hard, often in rural and exurban areas. Most of our candidates outperformed Biden in their districts, but unfortunately, the “top of the ticket” just didn’t perform as well in NC as we needed it to. Democrats nationwide had a rather poor showing downballot, so it wasn’t just us.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a total loss. Some of our candidates (both millennials!) won. In other places, we funded campaigns where there hadn’t been a really legit Democratic campaign in a decade or more. Even though we lost, there’s now a network of volunteers in place and up-to-date supporter lists that will make subsequent campaigns much stronger. To win, you need to run candidates in difficult districts, and when you do that, some of them are going to lose.</p>
<p>Besides – we were also badly outspent. Remember Duke Energy above? Well, aside from their direct (“hard”) giving, they sunk millions of dollars into a dark-money super PAC to run ads and mailers vilifying Democrats. So did the NC Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber’s super PAC, Citizens for a Better North Carolina, was run by two former top aides to Phil Berger (the GOP State Senate leader) who now have their own political consultancy. (Though of course, I’m sure all of their business was conducted without any …</p></div></div>

If you have not not seen it yet, go stream that masterpiece right now. #spoilers</p><p id="0d41"><strong>Why is this particular line so important?</strong> Because it is part of the keychain needed to unlock the many abstract concepts Lynch and Mark Frost presents to us, the viewers. The line is from the episode where Mike enters the dream of agent Cooper, revealing clues about Laura Palmers killer. What I find interesting about this line is its deceptive yet clear intention. The viewer is told what to pay attention to, but the dreamy context suggest we might be deceived.</p><p id="f29a">But some things are just what it is, how it sounds.</p><p id="57db"><em>Intuition guides us, one screen at the time.</em></p><p id="4949">For 10 years, I was writing for various advertising companies. My job was to craft words to lure the reader into whatever brand-context I was working on at that time, often with the help of abstractions of concepts, allegories, and other creative tools. It taught me a lot about perception and how I could, very subtly, plant hints for the viewer to decipher the brand message. But most importantly, it made me understand how the brain systematically create mental concepts to percieve and understand the world around it. Words play a crucial part in this process. An incredible 50 % of all words we hear cannot be understood out of context (when presented in isolation). By using concepts, the brain learns to categorize and make sense of all this variable noisy flow of information.</p><p id="b300">How ironic, you might think, that I found clarity in one of the most surreal dreamscapes ever to air on TV in our lifetime. To me, that’s the beauty of inspiration. It rises to our consciousness like wild salmon jumping upstream a river, striving to get a foothold in our mind amidst all the noise.</p><p id="4668">Like Lynch and Frost, I left the keys in plain sight for the audience to discover and interpret. Creative advertising requires just that, an idea we, the creators, code, and then let the audience decode. But UX Writing very often requires quite the opposite. You must write it like it is.</p><p id="856a">It has always been a beautiful mystery to me, how clarity has the power to shape us. How it informs us simply by being less intrusive or more truthful. <br>To me clarity is not the equivalent of writing short and efficient sentences. It can be about that, but not just that.

He managed to eliminate the inevitable noise surrounding any world-changing project and devote all his attention to making it the next big thing.</p><p id="4ba2">Regardless of age, title and which floor you work on, there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this, Focus is needed to build great stuff, but it also essential for knowing when your brand needs to speak up.

So, you don’t have to just play, say, if the first verse just needs two and four on the hi-hat, you don’t have to just sit there going… <em>&lt;taps uninspired on the hi-hat&gt;</em> …what I would do is listen to the vocalist and look for spaces to do small musical embellishments. <strong>Put it in the right place, and it’s beautiful. Do it every bar, and it’s horrible.”</strong></p><p id="2340">This is <strong><em>precisely</em></strong> what UX Writers should do (among many other important things). Listen to the project as a whole, look for spaces in between code, design, text, menus, forms — literally every point of interaction — to create something that elevates the project, and therefore the brand.

And yes, I consider UX Writing to be an essential part of building and/or maintaining a brand.</p><p id="d052">Words are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_note" rel="noopener">ghost notes</a> providing subtle dynamics to the sonic scenery. They will make people feel something.</p><p id="5f16">Humans like to be liked. Brands too. Therefore we make and effort to portray ourselves, man and brand, in a way that will serve as purposeful and friendly for our peers. From a brand point of view we would very much like people to feel what we want them to feel about us. This is usually where marketing says “we got this”. And they probably do. Persuasion is needed to increase awareness and market shares. But what happens after we get their attention?</p><p id="fe63">This is where guidance and clarity is provided and needed, not juicy headlines and rethorical tropes. Now it’s time to go with (and steer) the flow.</p><p id="eca1">Some people understand this process intuitively and how to utilize it in many different ways. In a talk at Design Matters 2019, Senior Product Writer at Slack <a href="https://medium.com/u/6aad0c825c59?source=post_page-----2b81f09aadfc--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Schmidt</a> shared insight from Slacks early days on how language could be a tool for identifying “bad” design, and how they discovered when to inject brand personality and how to do it. They came up with a very simple and interesting rule:</p><p id="f0e8"><strong>Never try to make the user feel<br></strong>Instead, look for the feelings they’re already having.<br>And just be part of those.</p><p id="c24e"><strong>👇🏻</strong></p></div></div><div><div><p id="84c2">I believe Slack is on the right path when it comes to how they percieve UX Writing. They have chosen a much less intrusive approach in a world where our minds are bombarded with emotional hooks ready to be reeled in. But for enhancing your UX Writing, I think being subtle and aware (but don’t forget to surprise once in a while) will take you far.</p><p id="acbe">Is your brands presence needed for solving this particular task?<br>Or is it better to get out of the way for a bit? <br><a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-power-of-whitespace-a1a95e45f82b" rel="noopener"><strong>Treat words in the same way designers treat white space.</strong></a></p><p id="cf73">My family owns a summer cabin near the ocean. In my younger days, I would cruise around in our family’s tiny motorboat. That was when I learned the concept of a rudder, a gentle device for navigating smoothly across the sea. This information suddenly reappeared a few years ago when I was writing about ergonomic seating. The company I wrote for had designed a new office chair that kept the person in it slightly moving while sitting down. One of them sat in the chair and used their feet to move around. Seeing this, I suggested to the designers that the feet act as a rudder to navigate the body. According to them, this was a perfect description of what they had accomplished.</p><p id="c439"><strong>I looked. I listened. And I found the embellishment I was looking for.</strong></p><p id="5e4a">In this ocean of information we’re slowly drowning in, I like to think of microcopy as an invisible rudder for our intuition. It’s there to guide you through interactive waters, shallow or deep, without you seeing it. If you can see the rudder, you’ve probably hit bottom, and then you have to slow down to understand the situation. When designing interactivity, people crave fluidity. Like in a musical piece that captivates us or in a movie that enthralls us with great dialogue and scenery. Or even a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 whose job is to help us navigate 60+ hours of content while keeping us immersed in their universe. Well played.</p><p id="54c3">Our understanding of the world is layered in mental concepts. Everything can be stripped down to its very basic components. Even what we know to be basic components has its own basic components. By understanding this, one becomes humble when faced with the task of understanding complex matters. Or answering complicated questions.</p><p id="24c2">Whenever I write, my goal is always to find the simplest version of the truth intended. By truth, I mean the pieces of information I relay to people who desire an outcome of some sort, typically in an app or landing page. Sometimes I need to let function dictate what I write; other times, it feels like a good time to sparkle with some creativity.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2238/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png" width="1119" height="1117" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*r7e4HbF2CWByVxNXGxryTg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A good example of creative microcopy.

	<p>PLEASE don't use FrontPage for modern web development! It's filled with security vulnerabilities and obsolete standards. The goal of this is not to convince you otherwise. The newest version came out almost two decades ago!</p>

<p>Microsoft FrontPage. The mere mention of that name is making most (if not all) of you seasoned web devs groan. "FrontPage was utter rubbish from dark ages of GeoCities" you say. "Everything it touched was ruined with horrific output and proprietary nonsense!" And yes, it was.</p>
<p>But... FrontPage as a concept. As a dream of what could have been, and a window into what <em>was</em>. Letting the typical home user at the time create websites, express creativity, and conquer the world by storm, all without being forced to learn HTML or CSS or JavaScript... In that regard, FrontPage couldn't be beat.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Microsoft FrontPage was for a brief period of time the ultimate content creation tool of the Internet, and why it later fell from grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before we can talk about goodness and ugliness, we need to talk about carphones and business meetings. Because this was 1994, when the Internet was still really new. At that point in time most internet chatter occured on Usenet groups (think something like Reddit) or BBS systems (think something like <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/5/">old AOL</a>; example pictured below). If you needed buisness stuff, like stocks or the such, you had to log onto the BBS of whoever had what you needed. This was kind of a pain.</p>
<p><img alt="A picture of a BBS (tilde.town) as of today" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/BBS.png"></p>
<p>Enter Randy Forgaard and Charles H. Ferguson. Ferguson, renowned computer industry consultant, contacted MIT graduate Forgaard (over carphone, in case you were wondering) to discuss starting a new, internet-based company.</p>
<p>His idea was that many corporations such as the Dow Jones, Bloomberg, Apple, etc. were sinking millions into building their own, completely incompatible dial-in Internet services. Therefore, they should create a standardized, completely open server/client combo to replace all the independent efforts. This hopefully would reduce the cost of development for those corporations, and provide a market for growth by making buisnesses <em>want</em> to have an Interent presence.</p>
<p>The two decided to found their own company, Vermeer Technologies, Inc. A month later, still in the planning stages, they caught wind of the brand new World Wide Web out of CERN. It was decentralized, open, and even more robust than they were planning. It was just about perfect. The only issue was that it was rather a pain to make websites if you were just some lowly advertising manager or whoever. The web needed an authoring tool for websites.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 1.0a, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-1.0.png"></p>
<p>So, somehow, they managed to hire many professional coders for no salary whatsoever to work on FrontPage. (Early start-up culture, perhaps?) Evidently it worked, as FrontPage was released (only!) a week behind schedule on October of 1995. By then the World Wide Web was exploding, with a 20% increase in sites <em>per month</em>. FrontPage also managed to explode, receiving many awards and positive reviews. In fact, it was so good that Microsoft ended up buying them out. According to them, not only did it feel like a native Office application, it was perfect for their ongoing plan to become more internet centric.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage 97, taken from WinWorldPC.com" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-97.png"></p>
<p>FrontPage over the years got integrated into the Office suite and made a flagship product for Microsoft productivity products. By Office 2000, FrontPage had more Office integration than you should shake a stick at; nailing down the Office user interface and allowing imports and exports across the whole suite. There's... other stuff as well, but let's stay positive for now.</p>
<p>I'll be covering FrontPage 2002, as that's the version I own, and the one I have the most experience with.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<p>The interface... is (in my opinion) one of the best interfaces for any program ever. No hyperbole. I think only the other Microsoft applications of the era like PowerPoint and Visio can top it. I can <em>see</em> why it won awards.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's start screen with no webs open" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Start.png"></p>
<p>Like any other Microsoft Office XP program, there's the sidebar on the right with common tasks. What you'll probably want to do is, of course, make a new site.</p>
<p>FrontPage's equivalent to "projects" are called "Webs". These Webs contain the files (all your HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and preferences (such as which web server to sync up with or what compatibility settings to use) for that website.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage's template selector" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NewWeb.png"></p>
<p>Start by selecting a new "Empty Web". Up pops a bunch of templates, including the "Empty Web" template. A bit odd, but sure.</p>
<p><img alt="The &quot;Personal Homepage&quot; template in action" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Template.png"></p>
<p>If you <em>were</em> to choose a template, it would give you a pre-populated fill-in-the-blanks site ready for your words and pictures. It takes some of the layout work and design originality out of it, but that <em>is</em> the purpose of a template after all. (Although, as a word of advice, <em>don't use these.</em> They're rather awfully designed from a web standards point of view. You can see it barely fitting in my window there. Imagine that on a smartphone.)</p>
<p><img src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-BlankWeb.png" alt="FrontPage open to a new blank web. Folder list and Views bar are visible."></p>
<p>Anyways, once you open your blank web, you get... nothing! (That's what you asked for, isn't it?) No worries. Really, if you think about it, it would be rather silly to start making a page off the bat. You see, FrontPage takes a <em>project oriented</em> approach to things. While you easily <em>could</em> just sit down and start banging stuff out, that's really not the way FrontPage wants you to go.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage Navigation editor with some pages created and linked up." src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-NavView.png"></p>
<p>Here's probably my favorite FrontPage feature: the Navigation editor. Here you create blank pages and link them together in a logical hierarchy. This closely resembles the process you'd usually take on paper when designing a website.</p>
<p><img alt="Navigation bar settings dialog" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Navbar.png"></p>
<p>With this hierarchy, you can automatically create a navigation bar in all your pages that are properly linked. If you decide to make a new top-level page, for instance, every page on your site will be updated to feature that page. (To replicate that feature on this site, I had to use some pretty tricky template scripting with my custom Flask server. I'd vastly prefer something like this.)</p>
<p>This feature is also nice because it forces you to <em>think about your site</em>. You can't just sit down like it's Microsoft Word and bang out some pages. You need a coherent plan. Before you can even start, you need to sit down with your client/team/self and ask "What do you want on your website?" To most people it's obvious that you need a website. Everybody has a website. What's significantly less obvious is <em>what</em> needs to be on the website. And FrontPage's web editor allows you to play around with hierarchies and layouts before commiting to anything.</p>
<p><img alt="PowerPoint Slide Sorter mode&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/PPT-SlideSorter.png"></p>
<p>One thing that's intersting is that Word, PowerPoint and Access all (vaguely) follow a similar model. Word has the Outline editor, PowerPoint has the Slide Sorter mode (pictured above, showing an interactive game I made when I was 11), and Access, being a typical database program, requires you to declare your tables before you can work on them.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is that, with the exception of Access (which not many people used, mostly due to its cost and relative rarity), you were never <em>required</em> to have a plan before starting. Most people I've seen use Word just do straight typing, or perhaps work off another document with an outline. But the option was there! One could do their outline <em>in their document</em> and flesh out around that. Likewise with PowerPoint, as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Highlighted template include code" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-TemplateInclude.png"></p>
<p>Another common task in web design is defining a "template" page where you fill all your content into. For example, every page on this site you're reading on now has the same header and footer, and every article has the same sort of thumbnail image at the top. That was all scripted using template features.</p>
<p>FrontPage, being an Office product, supports templates. The implementation admittedly is <em>super</em> janky, but it's there. You can include pages within other pages just fine, it's just a little tricky to set up. (FYI, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do templates too. It's one of their lesser-known features, IMHO.)</p>
<p><img alt="Report view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Reports.png"></p>
<p>Another really neat feature: reports. Like a compiler in an IDE, FrontPage produces warnings, errors, and statistics for your site. At a glance I can view all broken links, orphaned pages, oversized images, etc. This is a <em>fantastic</em> feature, something that modern web dev software just <em>doesn't</em> have.</p>
<p><img alt="Hyperlinks view window" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Links.png"></p>
<p>In the same vein as the Reports, you can see at a glance what links to what. It's a lot like the call chart in a software development IDE. I can see quickly every site linked from any page (shown here is <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/24/">the Sonic R color fix article</a>) and any subpages.</p>
<p><img alt="Tasks view, showing a task labeled &quot;Write FrontPage article&quot;" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Tasks.png"></p>
<p>Last feature, although this isn't nearly as useful in the year 2020. In the tasks view, you can put up a list of tasks that needs to be accomplished. Already that seems rather nice for keeping track of what you need to do. It's a lot like GitHub or GitLab's issue tracker, in a sense.</p>
<p>However, if you connect to a server with FrontPage Web Extensions (I'll get to that...), you can share this task list with other people. You can (again, like an issue tracker) put up a task to be done by someone else and work on a task that somebody else put up. It's a <em>very</em> nice feature for web development, but nowadays this is normally handled by source control providers like GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p><img alt="FrontPage editing the Sonic R color mod article" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/33/FP-Editor.png"></p>
<p>And, of course, there's the webpage editor. This works almost exactly like Microsoft Word, with some web-flavored spice. You type words and they appear in the page. You make those words blue, they're blue. <em>That said</em>, when you edit elements like that, it inserts an HTML 3.2 style <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> tag instead of trying to match it to a CSS rule. There's ways around this, but you have to be very diligent in doing so. This is mostly just due to FrontPage being a product of its time, though.</p>
<p>FrontPage is a program about planning, executing, and reviewing. Take the Navigation editor. You plan out the content of your site. You sketch up the layout. Then you reflect on if your layout matches your requirements. Or the Reports. Create content, check reports. Or the Tasks. Plan out what you need to do, do that, and then check if the task is complete. That, right …</p></article></div>

<p>If you’re anything like me you have made many “new” projects for the web. Perhaps a little website, an API or some little test thing for your friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then: <em>you need to deploy</em>. The first time it’s usually still fine. You’ve done this before. You build your Dockerfile, recycle an old kubespec / deployment.yaml and <code>kubectl apply -f my-app.yaml</code> It’s online; life is good.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>This article is really about what comes after that</strong></h3>



<p>You find a problem. Fix it in your code, docker build the image again, push it. Re-run kubectl apply. Refresh. hmm. the fix doesn’t show up!?</p>



<p><em>The problem is that Kubernetes (and Docker) don’t automatically pull a new version of your image when you don’t change the name of your image.</em></p>



<p>In this article I’m going to help you make the best, simplest, reproducible deployments possible.&nbsp; You may not know about ‘Make’, and if you mostly do .js or python it may feel a bit oldscool. But it’s actually very simple to use, and much more friendly than building your own ‘deploy.sh’ or ‘deploy.py’. Make will be the basis of what I show here.</p>



<p>In this guide I’m going to add the build steps one by one.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 1: Building your Dockerfile</strong></h3>



<p>I’ll assume this is nothing new to you. Instead I will just give you my two best tips:</p>



<ul><li>Docker has two build engines, the newer is called Docker Buildkit, and can be called with docker buildx build . it is <em>much smarter </em>for things like caching. Use it like so: <code>docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></li><li>Do expensive installs before copying in your code, this will help Docker leverage the caching and be much faster. For web projects this means I’ll do:</li></ul>



<pre><code>FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app/
COPY package.json
RUN npm install
# and only then
COPY . . </code></pre>



<p>Ok, now we’re going to use <strong>Make</strong> to make our life easier. Just make a file named <code>makefile</code> and put in the following content:&nbsp;</p>



<pre><code>dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t my_repo/project .</code></pre>



<p>Now you can do <code>make dockerize</code> and it will save you a lot of typing! — We’re going to do more of that. Note I call it ‘dockerize’ because you may want to also ‘build’ for just a local building of the project.</p>







<h3><strong>Step 2 – Pushing it to the Docker Hub</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’ll also add a step in the Makefile to push it to the Docker hub, like so:</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image) .

push:
	docker push $(image)</code></pre>



<p>Notice that I’m introducing a variable here. image. If you define them at top of your Makefile they will be are available throughout your file.</p>



<p>Great! To make our life easier we can also chain commands like so:</p>



<pre><code>$ make dockerize push</code></pre>



<h3><strong>Step 3 – Deploying it</strong></h3>



<p>Now we’re going to deploy our freshly built and pushed image to our Kubernetes cluster. I’ll assume you have a deployment spec called deployment.yaml which contains something like:</p>



<pre><code>      containers:
        - name: cool-website
          image: my-repo/project</code></pre>



<p>And we add the following to our Makefile</p>



<pre><code>deployment: 
	kubectl deploy -f deployment.yaml

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>The deployment part is nothing new. But notice how with deploy we add the verbs after deploy? This is to trigger those things <em>first</em></p>



<p>So now we can type make deploy, and Make will do everything for us.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 4 – RE-deploying</strong></h3>



<p>Now, this is where it gets interesting. If you make changes to your code and run make deploy again you’ll notice a new image will be built and deployed, but your deployment will not be updated. This is because the <em>image name</em> didn’t change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A (wrong)&nbsp; solution is to add ‘imagePullPolicy: always’ to your deployment. And this may actually work for you. But my experience is that it does not always work, and it’s really hard to see which version is running in production.</p>



<p>A better way is to add a version to your image!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lets consider the following Makefile</p>



<pre><code>image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>



<p>Here we introduce a variable $(version), but instead of defining it in the Makefile you can just define it at runtime, like so:</p>



<pre><code>make deploy version=2</code></pre>



<p>A special note is to be given to the modification to the deployment step. What I do here is to use the Stream Editor ‘sed’ to find and replace the word :latest with the version you specify. So essentially we edit the file and then stream it straight into kubectl to deploy it.</p>



<p>For this to work you need to make sure you tag your image name in your deployment file as image: my-repo/project:latest&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try it! You can now easily deploy new versions.</p>



<h3><strong>Step 5 — Using git</strong></h3>



<p>As you are working on a project a little longer it’s nice to actually refer to a given version ‘running’ to code committed. And luckily ‘git’ allows for showing you which commit you are on. So lets add the following line to the top of our makefile:</p>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)</code></pre>



<p>What this line does is call out to the shell and run git describe, which returns information about the current git branch and commit you are on. –tags –always –abbrev=7 and –dirty help to format the returned string into something clear and usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you use this you don’t need to specify the version, and can just type <code>make deploy</code>. Power tip: You can still use <code>version=22</code></p>



<h3>The complete Makefile</h3>



<pre><code>version := $(shell git describe --tags --always --abbrev=7 --dirty)
image=my_repo/project

dockerize:
	docker buildx build -t $(image):$(version) .

push:
	docker push $(image):$(version)

deployment:
	sed -e 's|:latest|:$(version)|g' deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

deploy: dockerize push deployment</code></pre>

November 26, 2020 | https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>The majority of software engineering literature portrays object-oriented programming as distinct from, and often irreconcilable with, functional programming. This is, of course, a false dichotomy, as the techniques encouraged by functional programming are applicable in even the most object-oriented languages. Yet object-orientation, being perhaps history’s most popular software paradigm, has popularized its tenets, and occasionally we can see them show up even in programming languages like Haskell, a language about as antithetical to the object-oriented philosophy as possible.</p>
<p>In this piece, I’ll describe a common example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">information hiding</a> in ALGOL-style languages like Java, then express that in terms compatible with Haskell. We’ll then use this technique to port a <em>responder chain</em> to Haskell, demonstrating how Haskell supports dynamic function dispatch in the presence of hidden type information. I write this not because I expect to break any new ground—all the techniques I use here are long-documented in the literature, and Haskell veterans will probably find little new in this post<span><label for="sn-0"></label><span>Those familiar with the care and feeding of existential types may wish to skip to the penultimate section, which contains a couple useful data types that I haven’t yet seen in the wild.</span></span>—but because the existing resources are scattered, perhaps oddly so given how central dynamic dispatch is to most programming languages that aren’t Haskell, and because exploring the edge cases in the design illustrates the compromises inherent in language and library design.</p>

<p>Most of the world’s statically-typed programming languages allow their users to write code resembling the following Java:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>Comparable</span> <span>someFn</span>() {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>return</span> <span>"a concrete String value"</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Syntactically, this code is uncontroversial: it’s a function that returns a value. Its only interesting aspect lies in the function signature−even though the function body returns a value of type <code>String</code>, its return type is declared to be <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html"><code>Comparable</code></a>, which is not a concrete data type, but a Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)">interface</a>. As such, we cannot treat the result of this function call as the <code>String</code> it actually is; we can only interact with it via the methods defined on the <code>Comparable</code> interface. This application of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">rule of least power</a> is a useful one, even in a strongly-typed language like Haskell: sometimes we want to hide the implementation details of a function’s return type.</p>
<p>We can try to write the same thing in Haskell:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>someComparableValue ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2">someComparableValue _ <span>=</span> <span>"a concrete string value"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Because this is not semantically-valid Haskell, we get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:3:27: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘a’ with actual type ‘[Char]’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          someComparableValue :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; Int -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Haskell’s typechecker looks at the body of this function and says “hey, man, you’re returning a concrete string value here, not ’any type that is <code>Ord</code>–erable.’” Though this is a valid notion in Java, it’s not valid in Haskell. Another perspective on this is that Java allows a value to have more than one type: we can treat a Java string literal as a value of type <code>java.lang.String</code>, or of type<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>even though <code>Comparable</code> is an interface, not a concrete type</span></span> <code>Comparable</code>, or of its superclass <code>java.lang.Object</code>. However, since Haskell doesn’t support inheritance, Haskell treats its values as having one, and only one, type. Working around this takes a judicious application of an existential type.</p>

<p>In Haskell, an <em>existential</em> data type is one that is defined in terms not of a concrete type, but in terms of a quantified type variable, introduced on the right-hand side of the data declaration. This is, as is the case for so many Haskell concepts, not a particularly helpful definition in the abstract. It’s easier to show than to tell, so let’s take a look at one of the canonical examples of an existential type: a <code>Showable</code> type that wraps any type that implements the <code>Show</code> interface.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are several interesting things about this data type. Firstly, it uses the <code>forall</code> keyword to introduce the <code>a</code> type variable: given that we’re dealing with <em>exist</em>-ential types, it threw me for a loop that there wasn’t an <code>exists</code> keyword.<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Scala reserves a <code>forSome</code> keyword for this purpose, which I think reads a little more accurately in terms of the intent of introducing this type variable: using the phrase “for all” is a bit inapposite given that the <code>Showable</code> constructor is applied to single values at a time.</span></span> Considering the constructor of <code>Showable</code> is perhaps more enlightening:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1">λ<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>t <span>Showable</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can read this as “<code>Showable</code> is a constructor that takes, for all types <code>a</code> such that <code>a</code> implements <code>Show</code>, an <code>a</code> value, and returns a value of type <code>Showable</code>, the internal <code>a</code> value of which is no longer visible to the world once it’s been applied.”</p>
<p>Secondly, we can’t use a <code>newtype</code> to declare an existential. Attempting to write the following:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>results in an error message:</p>
<pre><code>• A newtype constructor cannot have a context in its type
  Showable :: forall a. Show a =&gt; a -&gt; Showable
• In the definition of data constructor ‘Showable’
  In the newtype declaration for ‘Showable’
</code></pre>
<p>When we consider typeclasses as <a href="https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/fluent-polymorphism-type-applications.html">dictionaries</a>, this restriction makes more sense: in GHC Core, this <code>Show a</code> constraint will be represented as a hypothetical <code>ShowDict</code> data type containing implementations for the <code>show</code>, <code>showsPrec</code>, and <code>showList</code> functions. In this light, we can see that <code>Showable</code> takes <em>two</em> parameters, not one: an <code>a</code> value to wrap, as well as the <code>ShowDict</code> dictionary associated with that value’s type. Newtypes exist to wrap single values, and here we’re wrapping both a datum and its associated <code>Show</code> dictionary: as a result, here we need a <code>data</code> declaration, even though the associated <code>Showable</code> constructor takes only one value (in Haskell surface syntax). This is an understandable limitation, though it would be cool if existential values of this sort could opt into the <code>deriving</code> mechanism in the manner of newtypes.</p>
<p>A third interesting thing: we can’t write a function that unwraps this data type. What might seem like an intuitive type for the function is rejected:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>-- GHC will reject this.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>unwrapShowable ::</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb8-3">unwrapShowable (<span>Showable</span> a) <span>=</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can see this explained a little more closely if we use the record selector syntax.</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a <span>.</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span> {<span> getShowable ::</span> a }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Attempting to use <code>getShowable</code> as a function that extracts some arbitrary <code>Show</code>–inhabiting type produces a well-explained error messages:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:1:1: error:
    • Cannot use record selector ‘getShowable’ as a function due to escaped type variables
      Probable fix: use pattern-matching syntax instead
    • In the expression: getShowable
</code></pre>
<p>The mental model I use here is that applying a constructor of an existential type serves as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a> for type information. In other languages we can assemble heterogenous lists natively; in Haskell, by contrast, we have to opt into it explicitly: applying the <code>Showable</code> constructor to a value swallows its type information. We can’t write a function, whether the hand-written <code>unwrapShowable</code> or descending from our <code>getShowable</code> record selector, that unwraps some arbitrary type out of an existential. All that is retained is the ability, given a proper <code>case</code> statement to unwrap the value within the existential, to <code>Show</code> the value contained therein: it cannot <em>escape</em> its scope, as the error message above explains<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>We can, however, use the <code>getShowable</code> record selector to update the wrapped value present in a <code>Showable</code>.</span></span>.</p>
<p>We can, as I mentioned above, cross the event horizon with a <code>case</code> statement, binding the <code>Show</code>–conforming contents to a variable name:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>let</span> shown <span>=</span> <span>case</span> x <span>of</span> <span>Showable</span> val <span>-&gt;</span> <span>show</span> val</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Inside the right-hand-side of this <code>case</code> statement, we have a value <code>x</code> in scope. A quick inquiry with type holes reveals the type we expect:</p>
<pre><code>• Relevant bindings include
    x :: a (bound at &lt;interactive&gt;:28:15)
  Constraints include Show a (from &lt;interactive&gt;:28:11-15)
</code></pre>
<p>All we know about this value <code>x</code> is that we can call <code>Show</code> on it. Other than passing it to the basic combinators (<code>id</code> and <code>const</code>), that’s <em>all we can do</em> with this value. Any bit of type information has been lost, replaced instead with <em>capabilities</em>, via typeclasses. Again, when we consider typeclasses as dictionary parameters, we can visualize how this works on a core-calculus level: we discard type information, including only the relevant dictionaries provided by the context of the <code>forall</code>.</p>
<p>A fourth and final interesting thing about this type is that you can write it, using the <code>GADTs</code> GHC extension, without an explicit <code>forall</code> keyword:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Showable</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>Showable</span><span> ::</span> <span>Show</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Showable</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This stems from the fact that GADTs allow us to introduce per-constructor type variables and associated constraints, even if the type variable is not visible externally. Another thing to note is that data declarations containing existential values don’t have to be limited to a single value: they can hold concrete values, or values expressed with more <code>forall</code>–introduced type variables.</p>

<p>Being able to hide implementation details of a function’s return type is all well and good, but many users are going to need to convert (or attempt to convert) from an existential type back into a concrete type. Java provides this functionality with the <code>instanceof</code> operator and its cast syntax:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>Comparable</span> c = <span>someFn</span>();</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>if</span> c <span>instanceof</span> <span>String</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-3">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Got a string: "</span> + (<span>String</span>)c);</span>
<span id="cb14-4">} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    <span>System</span>.<span>out</span>.<span>println</span>(<span>"Casting to a String here would raise a ClassCastException"</span>);</span>
<span id="cb14-6">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a consequence of all Java objects descending from <code>java.lang.Object</code>, and the ability of the <code>instanceof</code> operator to query the type of an object at runtime. Though …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>I could probably achieve 300% more in 6 years as a programmer if I knew these things when I started.</p>
<h2 id="coding-is-not-about-the-coding">Coding Is Not About The Coding</h2>
<p>What do you think programming is about?</p>
<p>Writing code?</p>
<p>Writing good code?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It's just a part of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Programming is not about coding, programming is about solving problems with coding.</strong></p>
<p>End customers don’t care what technologies, languages, frameworks, or methodologies you use. They care only about one thing, whether your product solves their problem or not.</p>
<p>That’s why no one cares what technologies Google search is using under the hood. Until people can find relative information with it, they will use it.</p>
<p>It’s the number one thing I wish I knew when I started programming.</p>
<p>I would spend less time writing “best code” and more time solving customer’s problems best.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t write code just to write code, solve customer’s problems with the code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="communication-skills-more-important-than-coding-skills">Communication Skills More Important Than Coding Skills</h2>
<p>When I just started my career, lack of social skills was not my main problem. But when I moved higher, to the middle, senior, and leadership position, my weak soft skills became my Achilles heel.</p>
<p>When you work on a product with a group of different people (engineers, designers, managers), communication is the only thing that makes you a “team” and helps you effectively develop the product.</p>
<p>Lack of social skills does the opposite, it decreases the product development time and overall productivity.</p>
<p>Here is the real situation you might face:</p>
<p>The leadership team tells your product manager that they want to create a new product feature and put it in the next product release. It’s not urgent, they just want to release it as soon as possible (as always).</p>
<p>The product Manager calls you on Zoom, tells you what you need to build, and asks, <em>“How much time do you need to build it?”</em></p>
<p>You are doing a rough calculation and tell, <em>“I need 20 hours.”</em></p>
<p>The Product Manager is not satisfied with your answer. He wants to release it as soon as possible and show the management that he can deliver results fast (this is a very common situation).</p>
<p>So he asks you, <em>“Can you build it for 10 hours? We really need this feature in the next product release!”</em></p>
<p>And you know that you can if you cut the corners (no tests, messy code) but then you will need to refactor it, and it will take an additional 30 hours. Because other engineers will work with your messy code when you release it. And after refactoring, you will need to integrate their code with yours.</p>
<p>So here’s what will happen next. If you have bad social skills, you will not convince the Product Manager that you actually need 20 hours to build this feature. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Product Managers often have good social skills, from my experience. So if you can’t convince him that refactoring later is worse than spending 20 hours right now, he will easily argue with you and convince you that “refactoring later is okay.” And the whole team will lose additional 30 hours for this refactoring (I don't count the time to fix unpredictable bugs after).</p>
<p>But if you have good communication skills you will be able to convince him of the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>So improve your social skills as well as coding skills</strong> (send memes in the group chats on Slack or something).</p>
<p>And remember one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>People work with people, not machines.</strong></p>
<h2 id="regular-breaks-help-to-program-better">Regular Breaks Help To Program Better</h2>
<p>For 4 years I always feel exhausted after work. Somehow I could productively work only for a couple of hours. After that, I didn't have much energy. Until I learned about the Pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>It’s quite simple. You work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Your working routine becomes:</p>
<p>8:00-8:25 – Work</p>
<p>8:25-8:30 – Break</p>
<p>8:30-8:55 – Work</p>
<p>8:55-9:00 – Break</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I tried it for a week and was surprised at how focused, energetic, and productive I became  (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusboosterapp.com/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-technique/">the science behind Pomodoro</a>)</p>
<p>Then I went further and implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nickbulljs/status/1303037682294173699">52+17 system</a> and my productivity levels spiked by 200%.</p>
<p><strong>So</strong> <strong>take regular breaks if you want to operate at your maximum capabilities.</strong></p>
<h2 id="10x-engineers-dont-exist">10X Engineers Don’t Exist</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my career, I thought that a great programmer is a person who knows tons of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Such a mindset only gave birth to my impostor syndrome. I thought that I don't deserve my current position, my salary, that I am a “fraud.” So I started to follow every popular developer on Twitter, read every technical news, and thousands of developer blogs just to convince myself that I deserve what I have and to feel more close to the title “great developer.”</p>
<p><strong>This was not a healthy behavior.</strong></p>
<p>But it helped me to discover that a lot of people I followed (I thought were 10X engineers) actually didn’t know a lot of things. They may know how to do some complex things that require a lot of different deep knowledge in a couple of fields and at the same time don’t know some primitive things. Like to know how to design highly scalable database architectures but don’t know how vertical-align an element with CSS.</p>
<p>Big thanks to those developers, like Dan Abramov (creator of Redux) for <a target="_blank" href="https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/">this article</a>, they cured my imposter syndrome and showed me that it is okay not to know something.</p>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-hard-if-you-know-how-to-learn">Programming Is Not Hard If You Know How To Learn</h2>
<p>When I started to learn JavaScript, it was hard. <strong>Because I learned the wrong way.</strong></p>
<p>Read a lot of theory without the practice, no routine, no end goal. Chaos.</p>
<p>I thought it was normal to learn like this. Until I discovered <strong>deliberate practice.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a purposeful and systematic type of practice (learning).</p>
<p>The difference between normal practice and deliberate is that deliberate requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.</p>
<p>After I applied a deliberate practice, I began to notice how fast I'm progressing with learning JavaScript. My knowledge started to stick for a long time, not just for 5 minutes after tutorials. I created the end goal, why I am learning JavaScript, and understand what I need to learn, and what I don't.</p>
<p>📌 <em>Quick note: I’m creating a JavaScript course where I’m using deliberate practice to <strong>combine modern and practical JavaScript theory with a lot of real-world practice</strong> to teach you how to become a skilled JavaScript developer with knowledge of modern language features. <a target="_blank" href="https://javascriptcoursethatworks.com/">Join here.</a></em></p>
<p>So here is what you need to perform deliberate practice on your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Teacher:</strong> provides practice activities designed to help you improve performance.</li>
<li><strong>Perform at maximum effort:</strong> constantly being taken out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li><strong>Well defined and specific goals:</strong> not just “overall improvement.”</li>
<li><strong>To be in focus:</strong> give your full attention, no distractions.</li>
<li><strong>Do conscious actions:</strong> no autopilot.</li>
<li><strong>Instant response to feedback and modifying your strategy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you start learning a new language, technology, framework, whatever, stick to these rules to get big results as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-no-best-programming-language">There is no “best programming language”</h2>
<p>There is no <strong>best "something"</strong> in our world. Only <strong>best in something</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s take cars. How can we choose the best car in the world? By speed? By safety? By what criteria?</p>
<p>It’s impossible.</p>
<p>We can only choose the best car in a certain category. Like the safest car. Or the best offroad car.</p>
<p>And if we look deeper, every category solves some problems.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We have children and we take them to school every day, we want our children to be safe on the way to school.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the safest car.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> We go camping every weekend, so we need some vehicle that can easily get us to places that are difficult to access.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Buy the best off-road car.</p>
<p>The same is with programming languages. Some languages and tools are better at solving some problems than others.</p>
<p>If we want to build an interactive website, we choose JavaScript.</p>
<p>If we want to go with ML/AI, we choose Python.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>there is no best programming language, there is the best programming language to ...</strong></p>
<p>So start with a problem first, then pick a language to solve it.</p>

November 26, 2020 | https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://michel-slm.name/post/2020-11-23-on-safety-razors-and-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://michel-slm.name/img/rex_ambassador.webp" alt="rex-ambassador"></p>
<h2 id="on-safety-razors">On safety razors</h2>
<p>I recently switched over from the ubiquitous cartridge razors to double-edge safety razors. The original impetus was not finding a non-charging base for my GiletteLabs Heated Razors - the battery in the stem made it too wide for most razor holders - and noticing that a lot of reviews swear by various safety razors.</p>
<p>I ended up buying the 
<a href="https://www.razoremporium.com/rex-supply-co-ambassador-adjustable-stainless-steel-de-razor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rex Ambassador</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> a few months ago - and then held off on actually using it, telling myself I need to learn how to properly use it first. In the end I told myself I would stop using my Gilette the day after the US Presidential Election, and start using the safety razor the morning after the US Presidential Election is finally called – which was Sunday the 8th, with a nice 5-day stubble to test it on.</p>
<p>The first shave went surprisingly smoothly; the next few shaves ended with some minor mishaps - cockiness and distraction getting in the way - but overall there is no way I’m going back to cartridge razors after this. Feeling more in control, getting a closer shave, no plastic waste to dispose – and hey much lower total cost of ownership!</p>
<h2 id="-and-technology">… and technology</h2>
<p>There seems to be a parallel here between the world of personal care and that of technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>most people are trapped on proprietary, heavily marketed solutions (cartridge razors, proprietary operating systems, apps and services)</li>
<li>these proprietary solutions are at first glance more user friendly</li>
<li>the more open solutions have a steeper learning curve but are eventually more empowering</li>
<li>vendor lock-in</li>
<li>the incentives for the manufacturers/vendors and customers/users are not aligned</li>
</ul>
<p>Think Windows on one side, vs Linux (and the BSDs) on the other (with macOS initially being in the middle and increasingly swaying to becoming even more constraining than Windows). Think proprietary gaming consoles and mobile IAP-chasing games, vs game platforms that 
<a href="https://fennel-lang.org/setup#making-games-with-fennel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourage participation</a> like 
<a href="https://tic80.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TIC-80</a> and 
<a href="https://love2d.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LÖVE</a>. Think US-centric proprietary social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and services (Dropbox, Google Suite) vs distributed social networks (Mastodon, Pleroma, Diaspora etc.) and self-hosted services (Nextcloud, Cryptpad etc.).</p>
<p>What are most people sacrificing to the altar of promised convenience? Literally both time and money: our attention, higher costs; also our autonomy (you’re locked in) and our privacy (… so platform owners can mine your attention and monetize what they observe of your behavior).</p>
<p>If you believe in capitalism, this is bad news. If you don’t it’s even worse.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Part of the solution is regulatory. In the EU, 
<a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/eu-court-withdraw-personal-data-of-eu-citizens-from-us-cloud-services-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent ECJ ruling</a> requires EU companies to stop using US-based cloud services to host data from EU citizens. This could help push the adoption of more open, user-empowering, privacy-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>But in other jurisdictions like the US, regulation might be a long time coming, except maybe in California (plus the companies we’re trying to unshackle users from are mostly US-based). So a lot of the solution has to be bottom up.</p>
<p>We simply need to lower barriers to entry, both actual and perceived, to using the platforms we’re championing. Some involve compromises (e.g. 
<a href="https://flatpak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flatpak</a> is a great way to abstract away the differences between Linux distributions, to the point that 
<a href="https://flathub.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s easier to install proprietary apps</a>, including Steam – which improves the availability of games on Linux despite, yes, being proprietary). Some involve corporate backing (e.g. 
<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/lenovo-fedora-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora on Lenovo laptops</a>). A lot would involve being more welcoming to newcomers, and bridging the actual usability gaps there are.</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to overcome incumbency and the network effect. Let’s not make it harder for ourselves.</p>

November 26, 2020 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Voice search or voice-enabled search is the means of searching by using the most natural input channel, human speech.</p><p><strong>TL;DR You can find a demo of voice search done right in the bottom of this article</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/voice-search-statistics/">20% of all Google App searches</a> are done by using voice and a nearly 40% of US internet users are using voice search features.</p><p>According to PwC research from 2018, consumers actually prefer voice over typing for searching. And this is no wonder: typing on a smart phone is not the nicest of tasks and more and more people are using internet primarily on a mobile device.</p><h2>Voice search is not available on most applications</h2><p>But when it comes to applications and websites, voice search is still rarely available. Why is that?</p><p>We did some small research on developer communities and found out that the <strong>number one reason for not adopting voice search</strong> is the lack of developer tools for doing that.</p><p>Search is a very valuable part of many applications and designers and developer teams use a lot of time to make it just right for the users. Users who search can be over three times more probable to convert than those who don't search.</p><blockquote><p>Developer tools for building voice search haven't previously been available</p></blockquote><p>This means getting users to search and most importantly to find what they are looking for is of immense value to any product team.</p><p>Smart speakers can help here: according to ComScore, half of online shoppers are using voice assistants to help them research products.</p><p>But like we've written many times, smart speakers and voice assistants are not the <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">holy grail of voice</a>. Actually far from it. Voice needs to be a part of applications to be really relevant.</p><h2>Differences of voice search and traditional search</h2><p>Voice search is not just regular search box that has a microphone button and a speech-to-text system. This approach would lead into a bad user experience and this is not how Google is doing it, either.</p><p>In fact, the reason why a lot of searches on Google are done by using voice is that they have developed their natural language understanding capabilities. If you are looking for population of the USA, you can just ask "What's the population of United States" and you'll get your answer.</p><p>We search differently by using voice and by typing. For example, voice searches are typically longer than their written counterparts and they are expressed in natural language.</p><div><div><div><p>Sign up and learn how voice search can improve your key metrics</p></div></div></div><p>This has clear implications for voice search. While typing "Intel LGA1151 motherboards" to a search bar is a natural way for doing search by typing, uttering that out loud might prove difficult and probably saying something like "motherboards for new intel processors" might be a better way of expressing the same search by using voice.</p><p>While regular search can give valuable information on how the voice search should be implemented, it needs to be designed separately.</p><h2>How to do voice search right</h2><p>To get voice search right, it needs to support natural language. The experience must be natural and it should be as tightly integrated to the current user experience as possible. You don't want to add a voice assistant or a chatbot with a totally different user experience, but to complement your current search.</p><p>Speechly is the first developer tool that enables developers to add natural, real-time voice experience to their applications in a short amount of time.</p><p>Voice search done by using Speechly works on all platforms with a single configuration for consistent user experience, enables corrections by using speech and is easily integrated to the current user interface with minimal changes.</p><p>Here's a demo showing voice search done right. It supports natural language, long or short queries and updates in real-time to encourage user to go on with the voice experience or to enable them to correct themselves quickly.</p><h2>Voice search demo</h2><p>Speechly supports <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/ios/">iOS</a>, <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react/">React</a> and <a href="https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/react-native/">React Native</a> platforms. You can find tutorials for each platform in our documentation.</p><p>If you are interested in adding voice search to your website or mobile application, <a href="https://www.speechly.com/get-started/">contact us</a> to learn more!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

We tend to sit more and take less breaks than we would usually do in an office, and over time that takes a toll on our backs and necks. I thought I fixed this by buying a standing desk, but I was wrong. The problem is that I usually forget to raise the desk so I sit in my chair for more than an hour until I feel pain in my back, and that's when I remember that I should stand up. So how do I fix this? An alarm that would ring every hour would do just fine, but it's not very accurate. What if I'm not in the office? What if I'm working at night? Do I really want to spend time setting alarms? No!</p>
<p>I like to automate things so I found a solution for this as well. The only thing I had to do was to place a contact sensor under my chair, and each time I would sit down it would report its state to Home Assistant. From there on I could create whatever automation I wanted. In my case, after 50 minutes of sitting down, I'll have Alexa notify me that I must stand up, and insist every 5 minutes if I'm still sitting down. Here's how I did it.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-place-the-contact-sensor">Step 1: Place the contact sensor</h3>
<p>I found that when I sit on the chair, the seat will go down a bit, so I just need to find the perfect place for my contact sensor so that it will get close enough when I sit down. Also, I would like it to remain closed when I lean on my back, because that still counts as sitting down (and a bad position for my back). After a few trials I found the perfect position, here's how it looks for an Aeron chair.</p>

<p>The small magnet can be glued on top of the chair using its original sticker and it will hold just fine. The best part is that you can hardly see them when you look from above, not that it would matter that much.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-add-it-to-home-assistant">Step 2: Add it to Home Assistant</h3>
<p>This is where the fun begins. The first thing you have to do is to connect your sensor to Home Assistant, the way you do this depends on your hardware. In my case, I have a Conbee II so I have to pair my Zigbee sensor with it, then it will appear in Home Assistant as a Binary Sensor. I then created a template sensor just for fun. It has two states: "Sitting down" and "Standing up", here's how the code looks like:</p>
<p>I made a YouTube video where you can see how it works:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>European defense ministers did not expect to be chatting with Daniël Verlaan when they logged into what they thought was a confidential video conference. </p>



<p>Using login information shared on one of the defense ministers' Twitter accounts, the Dutch 31-year-old reporter <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-reporter-gatecrashes-eu-defense-ministers-videoconference/">gatecrashed their meeting on Friday</a>, creating a moment of comic relief — combined with a security alert — at a meeting where a classified document on threats facing the EU was on the agenda.</p>



<p>"I don't think I look like a spy. So I understand why ministers were laughing," Verlaan, who works for Dutch media outlet RTL Nieuws, told POLITICO in a call Monday.</p>



<p>The incident exposed problems with the tools that European officials have used to carry on their work during the coronavirus pandemic. It also raises questions about how slowly the Council of the EU has moved to roll out secure conferencing, eight months into the pandemic.</p>



<p>"The fact that you're a minister of defense doesn't mean you're a cybersecurity expert," Verlaan said. "Everyone can make this mistake and that's why I think it's so important to warn people about this."</p>



<h3>Joining the call</h3>



<p>Across the world, governments have struggled to adapt to new platforms and systems, with troubling and embarrassing incidents along the way. In March U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52152025" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> of the "first ever digital" cabinet meeting on Zoom, divulging what security experts said was sensitive information. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53667664" target="_blank">Court hearings</a>, <a href="https://threatpost.com/zoom-bombing-attack-hits-u-s-government-meeting/154903/" target="_blank">parliamentary sessions</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/09/829265445/zoombombing-city-hall-the-struggle-to-keep-public-meetings-going-virtually?t=1606124710773" target="_blank">local government meetings</a> have also fallen victim to poor security practices and unwanted intrusions this year.</p>



<p>In Friday's incident, a member of Dutch Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld's staff <a href="https://twitter.com/danielverlaan/status/1329799677827551233/photo/1" target="_blank">tweeted a picture</a> containing the web address of the meeting. The URL displayed the meeting ID and five of the six digits needed to access the meeting. </p>



<p>After receiving a tip about the vulnerability, Verlaan and a political reporter at RTL contacted the Dutch government and were told the meeting was still secure because the Council verified specific participants via webcam before allowing them to join, he said. </p>



<p>Verlaan decided to call the bluff. "I entered the URL, clicked okay and saw a screen asking for a pin code. The first five I knew, I entered them and added a '1,' then a '2' and eventually I bumped into the meeting," he said.</p>



<p>Footage obtained by POLITICO showed Verlaan in a large window at the top of the videoconference screen, dressed in a black T-shirt, grinning and waving to the ministers — some of whom laughed off the breach — as EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told him in a brief exchange he should leave immediately.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>The incident puts a spotlight on the EU Council's security practices, as the EU institution is forced to discuss issues of defense, security, trade and other sensitive topics on platforms it acknowledges to be unsafe.</p>



<p>"We have all the time been conscious of, and have warned that, videoconferences ... are vulnerable from a security point of view," a Council official told POLITICO Friday, adding this was one reason they are "not formal Council meetings and no classified matters can be discussed."</p>



<p>"In September this year, the General Secretariat of the Council proposed the introduction of a new and more secure videoconference system, which is currently being&nbsp;considered by member states," the official said.</p>



<p>The fact that the meeting's URL contained the login information should be a cause for concern, Verlaan said.</p>



<h3>'I do illegal things for my job'</h3>



<p>The incident could have consequences for Verlaan. The Council official said the "intrusion" was illegal and "will be reported to the authorities."</p>



<p>As of Monday, the Dutch journalist said he had not heard from law enforcement. A Council official declined to say whether Verlaan had been reported to the authorities. The Dutch ministry of defense deferred questions about potential legal steps to the EU.</p>



<p>Either way, Verlaan is aware of the legal implications his reporting can have, he said.</p>



<p>"I regularly do illegal things for my job because I have to demonstrate that something is wrong, that there is misconduct or something is amiss," he said. "For example, take a company that got hacked and whose data is online: It's illegal to access that data, but at the same time I have to verify this data and inform the company about what data leaked."</p>



<p>Earlier this month Verlaan <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/artikel/5195897/erasmusbrug-gehackt-verlichting-kleurtje-roze" target="_blank">got access</a> to the IT infrastructure of a bridge in Rotterdam and managed to change the lighting on the bridge, due to a vulnerability in how the bridge was connected to the internet. In October he <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5187220/jeugdriagg-kenter-jeugdhulp-datalek-dossiers" target="_blank">gained access</a> to medical files of minors who underwent psychotherapy due to a failure to properly secure an old website ran by a Dutch health care organization.</p>



<p>Verlaan said his reporting was always backed by RTL's editorial management and its legal service. But he added that he had not sought clearance beforehand for intrusion into the EU defense ministers' meeting  because he was just checking if authorities had been truthful about the security settings.</p>



<p>"By demonstrating, in a light-hearted way, an inoffensive way, a problem that's actually serious, I feel that's the best way to create awareness about the dangers online," he said.</p>

                    <p>For the last 60 years, we’ve seen consistently low productivity growth rates in the US and across the Western world. Meanwhile, recent scientific discoveries seem to be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">less fundamental</a> to our understanding of the world than previous breakthroughs have been. While the growth of digital technology has been tremendous since the 1990s, it’s the only significant part of our world that seems to have been changing. To look up from our smartphones is to see a physical environment that looks basically the same as it did in 1970. Innovation has been constrained to the world of bits and left the world of atoms mostly untouched.</p><p>This might finally be changing. Last month, the economist Tyler Cowen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-05/how-much-worse-can-things-get-that-question-may-be-a-good-sign">speculated</a> that we may be seeing signs that this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> is ending. Since his article was published, we’ve already seen almost a dozen announcements that have only driven home the point further. There seem to be cracks in the Great Stagnation and light is peeking through on the other end. </p><p><strong>Innovation in the physical world</strong><br>Most obviously, the recent announcement of the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/">successful development of several vaccines</a> to the novel coronavirus are a sign that America (with some help from Germany) is still capable of achieving Big Things when we are pushed to it. Despite consistent failings of the US regulatory state in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/04/14/a-failure-but-not-of-prediction/">delaying the adoption</a> of face masks and in <a href="https://thedispatch.com/p/timeline-the-regulationsand-regulatorsthat">slowing the rollout</a> of mass testing, the US essentially bet the farm that our strong biotech clusters would be able to create a vaccine to a new disease in record time, and it looks like we’re going to be able to do it in under a year! </p><p>It’s worth highlighting just how speedy this development timeline is when compared to the vaccines for diseases like polio and measles. </p><figure><img src="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1000w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 1600w, https://www.agglomerations.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/Vaccination-innovation-chart.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination</figcaption></figure><p>And not only did we develop a new vaccine, we developed a new *type* of vaccine. mRNA vaccines have long been speculated to work, but this is the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-showing-potential-success-of-mrna-platform-a-first/">first instance</a> of a successful vaccine application in humans using this technique. </p><p>In transportation, the promise of driverless cars has long been a centerpiece for a tech-optimistic vision of safer roads, better-designed cities, and eliminating the drudgery of a morning commute through traffic. But the technical delays of the last few years (when compared to the most optimistic timelines) have become a rallying cry for the <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/">tech-skeptic</a> as well. </p><p>It seems like they may finally be getting here. A few weeks ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/10/waymo-finally-launches-an-actual-public-driverless-taxi-service/">Waymo announced</a> that their long-running pilot program in Arizona is going to be open to the public <a href="https://twitter.com/jjricks_/status/1316318196375330816">without any safety driver</a> in the front seat. Days later, Elon Musk and Tesla rolled out a new self-driving beta program. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These two guys used a drone to make a video of Tesla's new "full self-driving" software in action. The drone, the self-driving car, and the global video-steaming service were all been science fiction when I was born. Living in the future is neat. <a href="https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc">https://t.co/4QqGcjFXsc</a></p>— Timothy B. Lee (@binarybits) <a href="https://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1321102111883579397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>This is a remarkable engineering feat, especially on Waymo’s end. It shows the company can successfully lead product development in an industry that relies on more stringent safety-critical engineering instead of the release-and-iterate model that its parent company grew up with. Waymo is evidence that Silicon Valley can “move at a moderate pace and not break things” when it needs to.</p><p>Granted, it’s unclear how long until and at what pace deployment of AVs to the rest of the country and the world will happen. If the Waymo model looks to be successful, it will be a steady, resource-intensive process of region-by-region expansion as the cars learn to handle new operational design domains and are rigorously validated in each city before the keys are turned over to the AI. In other words, expansion could look more like a cell phone coverage map than a software update that is instantaneously available everywhere. </p><p>But still, this is a significant, tangible mile marker that the industry has passed. AVs are operating in the wild now. We get to talk about *when* we reach the driverless future, not *if*. </p><p>In addition to the almost ho-hum daily progress in solar, wind, and battery technology where prices have fallen <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-has-become-cheaper-and-better-in-the-2010s-now-what">90</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2020/01/21/renewable-energy-prices-hit-record-lows-how-can-utilities-benefit-from-unstoppable-solar-and-wind/?sh=491f10ec2c84">70</a>, and <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/battery-pack-prices-fall-as-market-ramps-up-with-market-average-at-156-kwh-in-2019">87</a> percent over the last ten years, we’ve also started to hear very promising reports about the development of more fundamental breakthroughs. The NYT reports that a compact nuclear fusion reactor is “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/climate/nuclear-fusion-reactor.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">Very Likely to Work</a>” after a major theoretical advancement. There was also a fantastic David Robert’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">deep dive into geothermal energy</a> and the promise of advanced geothermal (whereby water pumped into the ground through a closed loop reaches a high enough temperature that it becomes “supercritical” and can carry 10x more energy per unit mass), in particular. Either technology, if perfected, would provide abundant, zero-carbon, baseload energy that is available anywhere around the world. </p><p>Cowen mentions briefly the huge market growth we’ve seen in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives. A few weeks ago it was announced that Impossible Foods, one of the largest actors in the industry is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/20/impossible-foods-will-double-rd-to-eliminate-animal-farming/">doubling their R&amp;D team</a> as they seek to take on plant-based milk, steak, and fish as well as improve the supply chains for plant proteins. In tandem, McDonald’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/11/10/mcdonalds-mcplant-sandwich/">just announced</a> that in 2021 they are going to be testing out a new McPlant menu.</p><p><strong>Digital innovation continues apace</strong></p><p>Not to be left out, in the digital world we’ve been seeing impressive progress as well. AI techniques like deepfakes which have been heralded as the <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/opinion/deepfakes-destroy-democracy">death knell for democracy</a> are now being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/nvidia-used-neural-networks-to-improve-video-calling-bandwidth-by-10x/">deployed by NVIDIA</a> to increase video fidelity while cutting bandwidth transmission for video calls by a factor of 10. In general, techniques to reduce bandwidth use are greatly underrated, and it’s going to be exciting to see the ways in which smarter compression can perhaps bring similar efficiency gains across the board. </p><p>And now factor in the steady rollout of 5G network technologies which promise to increase the raw bandwidth available to all mobile devices. With the combination of smarter compression and vastly increased bandwidth we could be looking at a baseline 50x increase in network capacity over the next decade. It’s hard to predict ahead of time what new applications will be enabled by all this new capacity, but in retrospect it could look like another example of <a href="https://diff.substack.com/p/how-bubbles-and-megaprojects-parallelize">parallel innovation</a> that both enables and is driven by the growth of VR/AR, driverless vehicles, and telehealth.*</p><p><em>*For those who are skeptical that increased capacity will generate new applications because a few cities have tried gigabit broadband<a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/faster-internet-not-worth-it/"> without much effect</a>, I would argue that both hardware and app developers are optimizing for the baseline user experience and we won’t see a ton of investment in new applications until we’ve changed the baseline capacity that developers can expect a sizeable user base to have. </em></p><p>Equally as impressive, Apple’s new M1 chip that was launched on November 10th seems to have taken the world by storm. As John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs">summarizes</a>: “To acknowledge how good they are — and I am here to tell you they are astonishingly good — you must acknowledge that certain longstanding assumptions about how computers should be designed, about what makes a better computer better, about what good computers need, are wrong.” Just as interesting is <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/what-is-the-apple-m1-chip-613935ea0903">how they did it</a>. By miniaturizing the whole system architecture and integrating it onto a single chip (no discrete RAM, graphics card, etc.) Apple has managed to pump out massive efficiency gains both in processing power and in battery life. (There’s perhaps a metaphor here for the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/breaking-up-big-tech-is-hard-to-do-1532290123">value of integration</a> for large tech firms as well…)</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXP4ZnW93TIsJ_dJe3NVmevfz5eMUnNC6CS40Dz_S0568BDiQKr8K8LqT5Ja-kLnXUKnS1UkDQf_6WYzBhfGa4c99lQDfqudhQaDF-XCYBEkxNoP3Vo3FlGtLl3sGFQcdtHBlGbv" alt=""><figcaption>https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the virtual reality space has seen its most impressive entrant in years with the arrival of the Quest 2 from Facebook on October 13th. There is no VR headset that matches it on a performance/cost basis, and the relative simplicity and elegance of the system makes it an ideal entry point. The deliberately low entry barrier of $299 is meant to entice a large enough user base that it kickstarts the virtuous cycle of having a significant enough market for dedicated VR developers to make significant investments in new applications, which then drives new user growth. Facebook believes we finally have a minimum viable product for VR that means this kind of two-sided market is possible, and it is betting billions of dollars to make it happen.

<p>
In July 2020 I went on a color-scheme vision quest. This led to some research on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space">color spaces</a> and their utility, some investigation into the <a href="http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/#styling-guidelines">styling guidelines</a> outlined by the base16 project, and the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/color.el">color utilities</a> that ship within the GNU Emacs text editor. This article will be a whirlwind tour of things you can do to individual colors, and at the end how I put these blocks together.
</p>

<div id="text-h-3fe0b0c6-76a6-4e9e-a061-66bd3ba54620">
<p>
I've been a part of several Linux desktop customization communities since circa 2013. One big aspect of that is the colors used across various contexts – for me, it follows that part of the game is trying to make a cohesive system of colors that relate to each other in an understandable (and thus tweakable) way – know what I can do to individual colors when making a "color framework" helps immensely.
</p>

<p>
I'm colorblind. This means I might be really picky about some colors. For example, I don't like the color red used for emphasis in text – thin red lines look the same as thin black lines to me (and so, red text doesn't typically &gt;POP&lt; for me, unless it's bold or has some other emphasis included).
</p>

<p>
Bootstrapping builders exist for base16! If I can bootstrap on top of their system I get a lot of free coverage within the software ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Plus, I just find this sort of thing really fun. Visual feedback is pleasing. Finding the right colors makes my lizard brain return to monke.

This will be the focal point of inconsistency. The level of brightness, quality of screen, and ambient lighting level are all things that affect the value of the screen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point">white point</a>, which is what everything else is relative too. Luckily you can (attempt to) account for this as well.

<p>
Color spaces are ways of defining colors in different sets of properties. They are the main tool you will have for reasoning about tweaking <i>individual</i> colors. You can then mess with these and convert them back into a format you can render (typically RGB) within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut">color gamut</a> (a range of supported colors). Here I will be pretty high level, focusing on some visuals for what sorts of things these properties look like. When I define the valid values for ranges, I will be using the scale I've implemented in my <a href="#h-cb3c6479-7d62-4028-8942-2b033bb1247a">helpers</a>.

The one you know and love:  [R]ed, [G]reen, [B]lue. Your knobs are amounts of each. As you turn everything up, you approach <code>#ffffff</code> (and down, -&gt; <code>#000000</code>). This isn't particularly flexible in "ways you can think about colors".
</p>

<p>
Here is a gradient from <code>#cc3333</code> to <code>#33cc33</code> to <code>#3333cc</code>:
</p>

 


<p>
To show the lighting effect, let's repeat the above gradient, but instead of using <code>33</code> for filler, we'll use <code>99</code> – that's triple(!) the secondary color amounts:

Saturation in HSL is a controlled version of chromacity ("distance from gray"). See the wiki section for more details.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Hue has several defined points (at rotating 60° angles), I like to think of it like a color compass:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSL: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Let's see the effect saturation has:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
And lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSL: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org758eb61">
<h3 id="h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428"><span>3.3</span> <a href="#h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">HSLuv</a></h3>
<div id="text-h-c147b84d-d95b-4d2d-8426-2f96529a8428">
<p>
<a href="https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/">hsluv</a> is an altered version of HSL that tries to be perceptually uniform with regards to lightness. HSL lightness by comparison is hard to make contrast comparisons in.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean for us? Well, let's take our above examples and recreate them in the HSLuv space:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 60°</p>
<p>green, 120°</p>
<p>cyan, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 240°</p>
<p>magenta, 300°</p>
 </div> 


<p> HSLuv: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 60°), saturation 50%, lightness 50% </p> 


<p>
Saturation:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: saturation scale 0-100% (step 10%), lightness 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Lightness:
</p>

 


<p> HSLuv: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), saturation 50%, hue 240° (blue) </p> 


<p>
These scales definitely look more consistent when reasoning about lightness values. HSL's hue feels all over the place by comparison – though at the same time that might be a more natural color mixing feel.
</p>

The white point is a defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_illuminant">standard illuminate</a>  not intrinsic to the value of a color. It is an additional piece of information you provide to functions when converting into and out of the CIELAB colorspace.
</p>

<p>
The standard white point is defined as <code>d65</code> – in this section, every conversion will be made with <code>d65</code>. Here is a table of commonly used white points and their meaning (for values, see the bottom of the wikipedia link).

The knobs A and B allow you to play with the 4 primary colors of the LAB space. If you take a look at the values, you might notice that the more negative we go, we get "cooler" colors, while on the positive end, we get "warmer" colors.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some LAB colors. The labels below will have the values of  <code>(L A B)</code> – Remember, A is green to red, B is blue to yellow (each with a value -100 to 100)

LCH is a "cylindrical" version of cieLAB. What that means for us is that Hue is different. Instead of 6 defined islands to sail to with our color compass, there are 4:
</p>

<div>  
<p>red, 0°</p>
<p>yellow, 90°</p>
<p>green, 180°</p>
<p>blue, 270°</p>

<p> LCH: Hue rotation 0-360 (step 90°), saturation 50%, luminance 50% </p> 


<p>
LCH lightness:
</p>
 


<p> LCH: lightness scale 0-100% (step 10%), chromacity 50%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Chromacity, "distance from gray" - very similar to Saturation (which I've seen cited as simply misnamed chromacity):
</p>

 


<p> LCH: chromacity scale 0-100% (step 10%), luminance 70%, hue 270° (blue) </p> 


<p>
Let's compare some spaces. We'll take some the RGB gradient from above, normalize the lightness in HSLuv and then maximize l[C]h, H[S]L, and H[S]Luv:
</p>

 


<p> original </p> 


 


<p> squash lightness to 50 in HSLuv </p>

For text, the Web Content Assembly Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum">link</a>. Let's take a look at some different text contrasts! I will steal the backgrounds used here from the base-16 grayscale sets: <code>#f7f7f7</code> and <code>#101010</code>. For reference, the contrast ratio between <code>#000000</code> and <code>#ffffff</code> is 21.0

Color distance is a measure of how far apart colors are by properties in spaces. For example, let's take the 'magenta' color from above, and increase it's brightness and hue until we're some minimal distance away. We'll aim for 33(out of 100) measured in the CIELAB space:

<p>31</p>
<p>35</p>

<p> CIELAB distance from the start color is shown </p> 


<p>
Color distance is useful because it lets us measure a kind of similarity between colors. You can use this to control where you stop transformations (color space property tweaks).

<p>I recently graduated, and in order to get my official graduation title I needed to get my private and public key from the government. <strong>That’s right, you go to the government’s office, certify that you are who you are, and you’ll get a private and public key in an USB key from the government</strong> which you can use to do all your bureaucracy.</p>

<p>You also get a TaxID which is comprised of</p>

<p><img src="https://danielsada.tech/images/blog/rfc.png" alt="An image explaining the structure of RFC, the Mexican Tax ID."></p>

<p>With this key you can:</p>



<p>Want to get your passport? Sign in with your private key and password to the government portal and get it. Want your birth certificate? Get it online with your private key. Want to check your scholarship or any related paperwork? Just login online. This has made Mexican bureaucracy really good for the amount of people it handles. It specially astonishes me that it is instant, compared to most of the paperwork in the US which you have to mail stuff and it’s in ten thousand different places.</p>

<h2 id="get-your-digitally-signed-university-diploma">Get your digitally signed university diploma.</h2>

<p>You enter your key via a web portal, and you can then get a signed copy of your university diploma by the government, which then links to a public government page which certifies you are the holder of that diploma. You can use this to certify that someone is a doctor, or lawyer or whatever with this system. I can also print as many university diplomas from the government portal whenever I want, as they are just a digitally signed sheet of paper (with a QR with the public key).</p>

<h2 id="create-signed-invoices-of-goods-and-services-pay-taxes">Create signed invoices of goods and services &amp; pay taxes</h2>

<p>With your keys, you can also sign your invoices and guarantee that it is you who created them, and when you create a transaction, it automatically goes into the recipient’s Tax ID. That means, that at the end of the year, I just login into the government portal/whatever software I like, and it <strong>automatically calculates how many taxes I have to pay</strong>. I can also login with my key into the government’s website and pay my taxes with it.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-created-this-post">Why I created this post?</h2>

<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus">social security numbers are not ideal</a> and some of the government bureaucracy in the US still requires mail or checks or a physical office, this is merely inspiration or information hoping for something better.</p>

       <p><em>I consider the phenomenon of “Golden Handcuffs”, first as corporate perks, then as pay, then as Silicon Valley’s cost of living. I reject every explanation.</em></p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Perks" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Perks</h3><p>You get kombucha on tap, organic granola, a masseuse on staff. Soon enough, you forget your passions, get comfortable, and never leave.</p>
<p>I hear this all the time, but it doesn’t actually add up.</p>
<p>After a few years, an engineer at Google is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.levels.fyi/">making around $350,000</a>. In contrast, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Remedy-Raw-Organic-Kombucha-Sparkling/dp/B07W7V7DRZ/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kombucha&amp;qid=1606035999&amp;s=grocery&amp;sr=1-12">organic kombucha is $0.14 an ounce</a>. So even if you’re drinking 12 ounces a day 240 days a year [1], that’s just $400, or 0.1% of total compensation. To frame that otherwise, one year’s salary could buy you a 1000 year supply of kombucha.</p>
<p>What about the other perks? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/pages/about">Google’s granola supplier</a> sells to the public for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gr8nola.com/products/the-original?variant=13611271782490">$7.20 a pound</a>. I don’t think it’s reasonable to eat a pound of granola day, but if you really wanted to, it would still only cost $1,700 for 240 work days. A nice massage is maybe $100, so if you go once a month, that’s another $1,200. Lunch is a pretty big cost, say $20 per day, or $4,800 per year.</p>
<p>What about your home office? The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-office-chair/">Wirecutter office chair</a> is $1000, their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">4k monitor</a> is $500, and a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://top-line/">top-line 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is $4,500.</p>
<p>So that’s an annual cost of $8,100, or just 2.3% of total compensation. Plus an upfront cost of $6000, amortized over several years.</p>
<p>I have a really hard time believing this is why people fail to quit large companies.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Corporate-Pay" title="Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Corporate Pay</h3><p>If perks represent only a tiny fraction of total compensation, then surely it’s the compensation itself that’s keeping employees in check?</p>
<p>This also ends up being tough to swallow.</p>
<p>Let’s say you quit your job, apply to Y Combinator, get in, pitch at demo day, and raise a Series A. Great news! You now have millions of dollars in the bank and can pay yourself a market rate salary again.</p>
<p>The odds that things do not go this smoothly are <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">maybe 99-to-1 if you’re a randomly sampled founder</a>. [2]</p>
<p>So let’s say you’re screwed and earn nothing as a founder. What’s the opportunity cost? Well in that year, it’s the full $350,000, or 100% of total compensation. But over your lifetime, the opportunity cost of taking a year off to pursue your dream is just 1 year out of a 40 year career. Around 2.5% of lifetime earnings. [3]</p>
<p>Is it not worth paying 2.5% of lifetime earnings to give your passion an earnest attempt? If you truly believed in something, would you really be unwilling to sacrifice even a miniscule fraction of all future income?</p>
<p>I’m sure this is part of the explanation, but it can’t be more than a small piece.</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Bay-Area-Cost-of-Living" title="Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Bay Area Cost of Living</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/09/01/silicon-valley-is-changing-and-its-lead-over-other-tech-hubs-narrowing">Ajay Royan of Mithril Capital writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are you supposed to have a startup in a garage if the garage costs millions of dollars?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a great one-liner, but it’s also garbage logic. Sure, home sale prices are in the millions, but if you just want to rent a garage, he’s off by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/apa?search_distance=5&amp;postal=94043&amp;availabilityMode=0&amp;housing_type=6&amp;parking=2&amp;sale_date=all+dates">CraigsList search</a> for homes in mountain view with attached garages. They seem to go for around $1,200 / bedroom. If you rent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1721-Morgan-St-Mountain-View-CA-94043/19512936_zpid/">this 4br for $4,500</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://perma.cc/7C22-EU5D">perma</a>) rent is $13,500 / year, or around $16,000 in a typical pre-covid market [4].</p>
<p>That seems expensive, but again, not compared to total compensation.</p>
<p>Let’s say you work at Google for 5 years, making $190k the first two, $260k the second two, and $350 the 5th. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#A6tBLiJGb6">Post tax</a>, that’s $793,000 in earnings. In those same 5 years, you spent $80,000 on rent, so you’re down to $713,000 in savings.</p>
<p>As discussed in the corporate perks section, Google takes care of every need you might have, so there are no other costs. [5]</p>
<p>Let’s be really conservative and say you didn’t invest any of your earnings during those 5 years. [6] And let’s continue to be conservative and say you’re using a 5% safe withdrawal rate [7] instead of living off the principal.</p>
<p>With those parameters, you are still pulling in $35,650 in passive income. More than enough to afford the $16,000 for rent, $8,000 for kombucha, granola and massages, and still have over $11,000 left over. [8]</p>
<p>Even one year at Google would net you $126k post-tax, which is $110k after rent. So at 23, you could quit your job and still have 4.5 years of runway to pursue your dreams. And you can do this while continuing to eat superfoods and living in the most expensive rental market in the world.</p>
<p>To summarize: Rising rent costs are nothing compared to corporate tech salaries. Royan’s argument that garages have gotten too expensive for startups is totally unconvincing.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If it’s not perks, pay or cost of living, what’s going on here?</p>
<p>I’ll provide my own theory in the next post, but here are some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">You donate most of your income</a></li>
<li>You love your job more than anything you can possibly imagine doing instead</li>
<li>You engage in very strong <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference#Temporal_discounting">temporal discounting</a></li>
<li>The credentials, learning or capital from your job are a critical step to future plans</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of those excuses apply, what are you doing instead?</p>
<p>Presumably, you have some values, and those values are not maxed out. They might be hedonic (your life is not as pleasurable as it could be), altruistic (the world is not as good as it could be), or narcissistic (your status is not as high as it could be).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, day jobs seem to be the proximate cause holding you back. I realize that quitting your job won’t magically turn you into a dream-fulfilling machine, but it is probably a good first step.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this. Everyone knows that it is best to directly pursue instrinsic value instead of getting distracted by instrumental goods and side quests.</p>
<p>So again, what are you doing?</p>
<p>I’m not asking rhetorically and this isn’t a motivational essay. I genuinely want to know.</p>
<p>Seriously, email me.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] I’m assuming 20 days of vacation, holiday, sick leave, etc.</p>
<p>[2] If you already work at FAANG, odds are probably much better. This reduces opportunity cost, and strengthens my point.</p>
<p>[3] Of course, the early earnings compound, but your salary also goes up later in life. Maybe that’s not exactly a wash, but this is all back-of-the-napkin anyway.</p>
<p>[4] <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-S-F-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php">https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Rent-prices-drop-again-in-S-F-and-other-Bay-Area-15692584.php</a></p>
<p>[5] I’m sort of kidding, but seriously, what else are you spending money on?</p>
<p>[6] For the record, the S&amp;P is up 70% in the last 5 years, or around 11% annualized.</p>
<p>[7] I know you’ve heard 4%, but 5% seems reasonable. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-inventor-of-the-4-rule-just-changed-it-11603380557">MarketWatch</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jg898y/4_rule_update/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>[8] To be clear, this is not a financial independence blog. It seems great in theory, but given how many people seem to struggle with fulfillment afterwards, I can’t strongly recommend it. I’m not against it either, but I’d like to figure out what’s going before I start giving life advice.</p>
