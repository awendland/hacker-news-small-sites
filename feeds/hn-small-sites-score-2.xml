<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>On January 22, 1970, a Pan Am Boeing 747 touched down at Heathrow for the first time.<a href="#footnote-10TY" id="ref-10TY"><sup>1</sup></a> It was the 747’s first commercial flight. At the time, British Airways had 11 of the jumbo jets on order.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to ride on one. I’m too late.</p>
<p>British Airways announced yesterday they’re retiring their entire 747 fleet. Permanently. Its cousins are also in trouble: the double-decker <span>A380</span> is grounded worldwide.</p>
<p>Landing slots at Heathrow are scarce. In 2016, Oman Air bought a single morning slot from Air France for $75 million. So while the 777, <span>A340</span>, and 787 use less than half the fuel per passenger to fly, airlines need jumbo jets to maximize passenger throughput.</p>
<p>Nowadays double-deckers are merely a waste of fuel. Just like a species facing an extinction event, the 747 got wiped out by an economic chokepoint.</p>
<p>Intelligent-designers often cite gaps in the archaeological record as evidence against natural selection. <em>If evolution inched along slowly</em>, they argue, <em>where are the fossils of almost-humans, and almost-almost-humans, and almost-almost-almost humans? Shouldn’t we find skulls of humans with tiny eyes, slightly-less-tiny eyes, all the way up to regular-sized eyes?</em></p>
<p>But evolution doesn’t crawl along in a straight line. Adaptation happens slowly, and then all at once. Chokepoints force the<span></span> <span>“</span>all at once.”</p>
<p>For example, birds in Britain and Denmark have been under attack by asphalt for a century. In Britain, it’s popular to load birdseed into birdfeeders and place them in gardens. Not so in Denmark. Within 40 years, the beaks of British birds have grown 1-2mm longer than their Danish counterparts.<a href="#footnote-20TY" id="ref-20TY"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>For millennia the beaks have stayed the same. And then asphalt, in a mere half century, forced British bird beaks to grow up to 10% longer.</p>
<p>Business follows the same pattern. Innovation prods along slowly. And then one day the economy’s equilibrium gets punctured.</p>
<p>We are in one of those economic chokepoints. The 747 and <span>A380</span> are collateral damage.</p>
<p>What else is facing evolutionary death because of COVID?</p>
<p>It might be better to invert that question. What types of businesses will survive despite COVID? What traits do those businesses have that will spread like memes throughout the economy?</p>

     Almost a year has passed since the devastating firebombing of Kyoto Animation
that murdered thirty-six employees and harmed many others. Kyoto Animation,
affectionately known as KyoAni, is an anime studio that has earned the love of
countless fans, and I am proud to include myself among them. KyoAni receives the
devotion it does because it has changed lives for the better, and every KyoAni
fan probably has a story to tell. I first came to know KyoAni from <em>K-On</em>, a
heartfelt show capturing the nostalgic innocence of adolescence through the
youthful adventures of five girls in a band. <em>K-On</em> taught me to appreciate the
fleeting moments of life, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em> is an anime created by Kyoto Animation under director Naoko Yamada and
screenwriter Reiko Yoshida, adapted from a manga by Kakifly. <em>K-On</em> follows the
five members of the Sakuragaoka Girls' School's Light Music Club, or <em>keionbu</em>:
Yui Hirasawa on lead guitar, Mio Akiyama on bass, Ritsu Tainaka on drums, Mugi
Kotobuki on keyboard, and their underclassman Azusa Nakano on rhythm guitar.
Over their three years of high school, the girls connect over school life, band
practice, and after-school tea time in the music room, and they become tight
friends.

  <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/12005">Sakugabooru</a>)
     </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
     Truthfully, <em>K-On</em>'s first season is merely mediocre: enjoyable, but not
memorable. <em>K-On</em>'s second season, which depicts senior year for Yui, Mio,
Ritsu, and Mugi, is where it really shines as a poignant tale of friendship and
adolescence. When the girls reunite and banter in the music room before class on
their first day back, you get the feeling that they've all been friends since
forever. However, right from the get-go, there is a tone shift: the atmosphere
is melancholy as the friends plan their exciting year ahead, their last year
together. Time seems to pass slowly as the <em>keionbu</em> spends its remaining months
together bonding even closer, with a field trip to Kansai, a school play of
Romeo and Juliet, and one last school festival performance before graduation.
<em>K-On</em> reminds us to cherish our youth and our time with friends: these days are
limited. However, if we make the most of our time together, even after we go our
separate ways we'll still have the warmth of all the fond memories.
    </p>
    <p>
     I first watched <em>K-On</em> in my junior year of high school. Before, I didn't care
to make memories. I was obsessed with programming language theory and
constructive mathematics, and I single-mindedly focused on learning higher-level
math on my own. I was eager to leave high school so I could study my passions
in college, and I was even thinking about graduate school! However, after I
watched the <em>keionbu</em> spend its carefree days together before saying goodbye, I
felt intense regret and asked myself: How had I been spending my own high school
days? <em>K-On</em> made me realize that I was growing up too fast, there was more to
life than just math, and I was missing out on a lot of memories in a chapter of
life that I would never experience again. First, I wanted to join a school club
of my own. Around the same time, an underclassman sought to found a programming
club, and I helped it grow. Although the programming club obviously didn't turn
out the same as the <em>keionbu</em>, I still made new friends there nonetheless.
<em>K-On</em> also inspired me to pick up the guitar so I could lose myself in music
just as the girls did.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>K-On</em>'s thoughtful themes and genuine depiction of the joys of adolescence
overwhelmed me: I hadn't seen anything like it before, and I recognized that I'd
experienced something truly special. That was when I took notice of KyoAni and
director Naoko Yamada. As one fan puts it, <a href="https://honeysanime.com/the-history-of-kyoto-animation/">"K-On! really started the tradition
that KyoAni titles would tell the stories of normal people in beautiful ways,
something the studio would begin to be known for."</a> In particular, <em>K-On</em>
was the breakout success for Naoko Yamada, the young talent who would become
known for her works centering around adolescence, including the critically
acclaimed film <em>A Silent Voice</em> (which, I might add, was snubbed in favor of
<em>The Boss Baby</em> in the Western-centric and out-of-touch Oscars). <em>K-On</em> is just
one example of KyoAni's work, which are respected for their high production
quality and loved for their often heartfelt subject matter.

    </figure>
    <p>
     The humanity of KyoAni's fiction parallels that of its reality, a rare beacon in
the infamously harsh anime industry. The studio has its own animator training
school, pays its employees a salary instead of per frame, and provides maternity
leave to support its female employees. These conditions pay back as animators
can focus on quality over quantity and KyoAni can maintain in-house talent and
develop its own style. <a href="https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/08/25/the-evolution-of-kyoto-animation-a-unique-anime-studio-and-its-consistent-vision/">KyoAni eventually achieved the financial independence to
run its own production committees so that creators may be in charge of their
works.</a> Not only does KyoAni shine through its anime, it is also a one-of-a-kind in
the anime industry.
    </p>
    <p>
     I remember when I woke up on July 18 and found KyoAni in the international news.
I remember learning the horrific details of the massacre, feeling overwhelmed
by the Western media coverage of varying quality, and getting angry at the
misinformed commentary from unfamiliar outsiders. There couldn't have been a
greater contrast between KyoAni's innocence and its tragedy. I asked: Oh,
KyoAni, why did this have to happen to you?
    </p>
    <p>
     But, I also remember the show of love that KyoAni fans around the world
sent the ravaged studio in the aftermath of the attack. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyoto-animation-fire-money/donations-top-30-million-for-kyoto-animation-arson-victims-in-japan-idUSKBN1YV0MR">KyoAni received $30
million in donations</a> and <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/15/kyoto-animation-has-a-touchingly-kind-plan-to-distribute-its-3-2-billion-yen-in-arson-donations/">selflessly reserved all the money to compensate the victims and their
families, and none of it for rebuilding the business</a>. Even in the face of death and destruction, KyoAni stood strong with dignity
and compassion. I want to see KyoAni recover and grow and succeed. KyoAni
constantly inspires me to become a kinder person, and countless fans have
personal stories of the studio's positive impact. I hope that even more people
discover the goodness of KyoAni.
    </p>
    <p>
     You know, there's a phenomenon where you don't realize who you have to be
thankful for until they're gone. I'm reminded of a certain <em>K-On</em> episode: When
the music room is closed off for repairs, the <em>keionbu</em> must relocate so it can
prepare for its upcoming concert. Unable to practice in their new locations, the
girls brainstorm song ideas instead. When the music room finally reopens, they
realize not to take for granted what they already have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, Yui's doting sister Ui Hirasawa overworks herself caring for Yui and
comes down with a cold. As Ui languidly lies in bed with a fever, Yui endeavors
to repay her sister for her kindness over all the years by preparing a meal,
only to find that cooking is hard! When Ui awakens the next morning, she
discovers Yui fast asleep at her desk with a sheet of lyrics. Yui had stayed up
late writing a new song for the concert devoted to her sister: <em>U&amp;I</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      <em>I had thought that it was ordinary to have you by my side</em><br>
<em>I had thought that these days would last forever and ever</em><br>
<em>Sorry, now I realize that these days were extraordinary</em><br>
<em>So first, I need to tell you: "Arigatou!"</em>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Yui Hirasawa, <em>U&amp;I</em>
    </p>
    <p>
     KyoAni, may my feelings reach you: arigatou!

<p>Adapting your language to match that of your audience, in today's world, seems to be growing in importance by the day. Let's contrast two public figures in public appearances that took place yesterday: Fauci vs. Trump.</p>
<h2 id="dr-fauci-vs-populism">Dr Fauci vs Populism</h2>
<p>The rising wave of populism in the U.S has wrought a "distrust of experts". That's a real shame, especially when you don't listen to your infectious disease expert during a Pandemic.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 39.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2039.png"></p>
<p>Dr Fauci literally wrote the book on infectious disease, yet the populists are calling for his head. Why?</p>
<h3 id="they-dont-understand-a-word-he-says">They don't understand a word he says</h3>
<p>I was watching this <a href="https://web.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10112108870243761/">interview</a> of Dr Fauci by Zuck, yesterday. Finally Fauci is given a chance to speak to the people. Yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Citizenry"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>People?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"myalgic encephalitis"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Feeling too tired to lift an arm or get out of bed?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"deleterious consequences"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad things happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"i used the word 'comparable' and i think it may have been taken out of context"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then don't say 'comparable'.</p>
<p>Indeed we already have evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/07/09/2008868117">working memory predicts social-distancing compliance</a>. This is pretty damning evidence: essentially people with lower working memory capacity are unwilling to socially distance themselves as they cannot hold enough variables in mind to accurately assess the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Thus it isn't too much of a leap to theorise that a lower working memory capacity is also linked with a restricted vocabulary, and thus a reduced ability to process Dr Fauci's long, complex sentences which are laiden with technical jargon and advanced vocab.</p>
<p>Or to put it bluntly: the idiots don't understand Dr Fauci.</p>
<h2 id="donald-trump-is-a-communication-wizard">Donald Trump is a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Scott Adams accurately predicted <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/10/23/the-case-for-a-trump-landslide-part-1/">Donal Trump would win the elections in a landslide</a> back in 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trump is talking directly to peopleâ€™s subconscious. Everything else he says is just a carrier signal." --Scott Adams (<a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2015/09/06/how-to-spot-a-wizard/">how to spot a wizard</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of Trump's communicative Wizardry. On the same Day Dr Fauci was telling the citizenry about myalgic encephalitis and deleterious consequences, Trump did this:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 40.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2040.png"></p>
<p>Trump had the audacity to set up two cranes, to visually demonstrate lifting regulatory weights off the Republican red truck, while regulation still weighing down on the Democrat blue truck. This is pure communication genius, <strong>because any idiot can understand it</strong> and it <strong>communicates to their subconscious</strong>.</p>
<p>By catering to the lowest common denominator, Trump ensures he captures 100% of his potential base. Not a single word is lost. In fact this kind of visual communication transcends language, education level, even culture.</p>
<h2 id="boris-johnson-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Boris Johnson is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>In this interview, Johnson shares his communication principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What people listen to are short anglo-saxon words that readily correspond to some object in the universe that they can identify. So in other words: talk simply, in plain English, and talk about stuff in the real world." --Boris Johnson</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Deriding people like Trump or Johnson for their perceived linguistic blunders utterly misses the point. <strong>Their blunders are what makes them accessible.</strong> Their simple language is what makes them understable. Their communicative wizardly is what makes them irresistible to their base.</p>
<h2 id="elon-musk-is-also-a-communication-wizard">Elon Musk is also a communication Wizard</h2>
<p>Those who know me will confirm this to you: i have been a huge Musky for a very long time. Elon Musk is yet another genius at tailoring his communication to his base:</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 37.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2037.png"></p>
<p>Musk speaks to engineers, or generally a base with technological interests, so his language is not always as simple as it could be. But when you consider the topics he talks about, you have to admire how accessible he is able to make them. The language is simple, and the topics relate to the real world.</p>
<p><img alt="Pasted image 41.png" src="https://shyal.com/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2041.png"></p>
<p>And then there are his masterpieces of communication, like the Tesla he sent into orbit. Once again, pure communication genius that transcends language and culture.</p>
<p>Or his EDM track:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOEWUm6aGPg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't doubt your vibe, because it's true." -- Elon Musk</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick glance at Tesla's stock performance since the <a href="https://shyal.com/blog/tesla-stock-bottom-date">tesla stock bottom date</a> will tell you the message was indeed recieved.</p>
<h2 id="idiocracy-had-it-right">Idiocracy had it right</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/">Idiocracy (2006)</a> is a spooky and hilarious foray into a potential future dumbing down of the human race. The main character, from our time, <strong>who's name is "no sure"</strong> wakes up in the future as the <strong>man with the highest IQ. But nobody understands a word he says</strong>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGUNPMPrxvA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>He narrowly manages to save the human race by <strong>showing them</strong> that watering crops with water instead of gatorade is the solution to all their problems.</p>

<p>All the evidence points to dumbing down your language, and communicating visually and symbolically to become an unstoppable communicator. <strong>Think like a scientist and talk like a populist; you will become unstoppable</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that feeling when someone is explaining an idea and you're struggling to make sense of it—like peering out into dense fog, hoping to glimpse the outline of an approaching ship? Maybe it's because they're using unfamiliar acronyms or taking leaps of logic, or maybe it's simply not something you have any personal experience with. The idea is obvious to them, but not to you.</p><p>In Richard Feynman's hilarious and incisive memoir, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355624/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliotpeper-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0393355624&amp;linkId=759f61e594ab9f1df1971b41fa4ce33b" target="_blank">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a></i>, the Nobel Laureate shares his personal method for cutting straight to the heart of seemingly complex ideas, even when speaking to experts in fields far beyond physics: “I had a scheme, which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples.”&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever anything was vague or confusing, he would ask for a concrete example. Then, even as his interlocutor reverted to describing general theory, Feynman would follow the concrete example along in his mind—often noticing flaws or opportunities in the idea that weren't obvious in the abstract. Just as Theseus escaped the labyrinth by following Ariadne's string, so you can use real, physical examples to escape the labyrinth of abstract thought, and arrive at insight.</p><p>Writing fiction is often about reversing Feynman's scheme: making up compelling stories that provide concrete examples from which ideas can be derived, thereby illuminating them.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GPT-3 (OpenAI's text generation model) imitating human text: We aren't pulling the mask off the machine to reveal a genius wizard, we're pulling the mask off each other to reveal the bar is low.</p>
<p>It's a little spooky for another reason. In places where very average people read very average comments all day long (reddit, etc) I think we can expect a Commentdämmerung moment in the near future.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to stonewall a thread about a topic. Or every thread about a topic. Any time the subject is posted, comments start rolling in. People arguing with each other along familiar lines. The same back and forth stuff like usual. Except this time, it's all bots, and it's indistinguishable because the speech patterns of average people are... average. And it's <em>way, way louder.</em> You sort and collapse comments to try to find a new angle, but you can't. It's saturated with the blandest takes imaginable as quick as the spam filters allow.</p>
<p>How do you get to the point, then, where you're only filtering by human comments? What happens when its 99,000 comments, and 99% of them bots?? Will you know? Will you be influenced?</p>
<p>Will the average person be influenced? If advertising and the idea of saying something over and over works, and words are <em>free,</em> and you can GPT-3 your hand-rolled (or state authorized) propaganda every day in every comment thread in every forum to look like an average person is advocating for X, will other average people be more convinced of X?</p>
<p>This is the twilight of the comment sections.</p>
<p>Rather than authors GPT-3ing their own works and then revealing that they were ghost-written by the computer, the creepy scenario is someone hand-crafting conspiracy theories or lies so wild that no respectable person would fall for them, and then using GPT-3 bots to make it look like consensus is real, and convincing millions via synthetic social pressure.</p>
<p>Or: people sometimes edit wikipedia, write an article and use wiki as a source, then several days later change Wikipedia to use the article as a source. A synthetic citation. What's that look like at scale? Remember: The bar for writing is low.</p>
<p>I don't think the future will be dark. In fact I'm quite optimistic. But I think social networks and forum sites will change. They won't compete over who has the biggest piles of content (user counts), they will compete over context (authenticity, real friends, small discussions). In other words, the next reddit, twitter, &amp; facebook etc competitors will not look like reddit, twitter &amp; facebook.</p>
<p>They will be smaller by design, harder to get in to, and slower-paced. And they'll be better. Note that by solving the GPT-3 problem, you also largely solve the troll problem. Well, hopefully. Note in the above Commentdämmerung scenario, they can only happen as long as words are free. The simplest way to avoid this problem is to charge a small admissions fee. Then at least only actors with deep pockets can influence the average reader.</p>
<p>Note: GPT-3 isn't there yet for something like this. After reviewing a lot of GPT-3 output for a while today, I'm actually unimpressed. The daemon of genius clearly isn't home. The uncannily good ones that get shared are shared by humans, that is, they're hand-picked and so make the output look better than it is on average. But we can expect a point in the future where free-for-all comment sections are essentially over, if actors want them to be. I think this is unfortunate because most of world history existed in dialogue, and then we shifted to mass-media, inventing ideology along the way, and its only recently in the internet age that we have returned to the agora model of mass person-to-person communication. (I've written about that, <a href="https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/are-we-still-thinking-795bd9f4a658">here</a>). It would be a big shame if this ruins the bigger agoras, and it might.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe at this point that synthetic writing will replace good writers, just as computers have not replaced chess players. But I suspect it will become a crucial tool for creatives, just as chess engines have become a crucial tool for chess players to see what they're doing wrong, how they could improve, etc. A thesaurus is useful, a GPT-4-saurus would be much nicer. Imagine the writers block one could overcome, with a suggestion engine trained on you and writers you admire! Perhaps it's not writers who should worry, but editors.</p>
<p>Then again, do imagine a suggestion engine writing away alongside you. After a while, are you doing the thinking, or are you letting the GPT-4-saurus take over? Are you convincing the readers, or is the program's most-compelling-path-of-least-resistance just operant conditioning both you and the readers? Who's clicking publish?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>At the beginning of this year, I decided it was finally time to port my website from a <span>PHP</span>-based <span>CMS</span><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to a JavaScript-based Static Site Generator (<span>SSG</span>). This was for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>After starting out as a ‘full-stack’ developer, I now work solely on the front end: If I need to write custom functionality, I don’t want to write it in <span>PHP</span> when I could be writing it in JavaScript.</li>
<li>I don't need the layers of abstraction or the complexity of a <span>CMS</span> — markdown files are where I'm most comfortable writing content and I’d be happy never to touch a My<span>SQL</span> database or <span>wysiwyg</span> editor again.</li>
<li>I want to improve my site’s performance: static <span>HTML</span> files are, 99 times out of 100, going to be faster than pages built on the fly.</li>
<li>Lastly, there’s the cost benefit: A <span>LAMP</span> stack<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> server costs money every month; Netlify’s free tier (300 build minutes/month) should comfortably cover a personal blog at zero cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I'd decided I want a Static Site Generator and it needed to use JavaScript (which ruled out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>), I narrowed the list down to two very different contenders:</p>
<h2>“I heard Gatsby was good”</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">the official site</a>, “Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”. It has a data layer powered by GraphQL and it outputs everything to static files, allowing you to host it pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When I first heard that I could write React and use this cool new GraphQL thing, while still outputting static pages that work without JavaScript, I was keen to give it a try. <em>‘This sounds like Progressive Enhancement but without the effort’</em> I thought. Unfortunately, as with most things that sound too good to be true, after some investigation, there turned out to be a catch. Here's what happens the first time a user visits a Gatsby site:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user requests a page</li>
<li>The server sends the statically-generated <span>HTML</span> document to the user’s browser and the browser starts rendering the page.</li>
<li>Now that the <span>HTML</span> document has arrived, the JavaScript bundle (including the React library and any other JavaScript required to render the page) begins downloading, parsing and compiling in the background</li>
<li>The JavaScript is ready to run — the whole <span>DOM</span> gets “hydrated”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> with React components</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s something not quite right here — Gatsby forces you to load the same page again, but as React components; until that extra step is complete, none of the elements that require JavaScript (e.g. buttons, menus, custom inputs) are actually interactive.</p>
<p>If your site doesn’t have any interactive elements (excluding links, they work without JavaScript, even in Gatsby), your users still have to download this JavaScript anyway, for the sole purpose of turning your site into a Single-Page Application (<span>SPA</span>), which has its own drawbacks as we'll soon discover.</p>
<p>This extra bloat seems to go against one of the main reasons for moving to a <span>SSG</span>: making pages faster. Your flashy Gatsby site might be fast on a $2,000 MacBook, but for someone using a budget smartphone on a 3G connection, it's visible yet unresponsive, for 15 seconds while the user waits for the JavaScript to load. It’s also unnecessarily draining their battery <em>and</em> data allowance.</p>
<p>If the browser needs to parse 296kb of JavaScript<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> to show a list of blog posts, that’s not Progressive Enhancement, it’s using the wrong tool for the job. To use the rather fuzzy website/web app distinction — React is for building web apps: interactive UIs that need to respond to user input or fetch data in real time — your blog is just a website <em>and that’s fine</em>.</p>
<h2>Accessibility in single-page applications</h2>
<p>A single-page application is a website that forgoes the traditional method of navigation on the web, i.e. loading new content by loading a new <span>HTML</span> document; instead it uses JavaScript features like <span>AJAX</span> and the History <span>API</span> to swap in new content without triggering a page load. The goal is to increase perceived performance and make the website feel more like a 'native' app (something you’d download from an app store). The problem with getting rid of full-page reloads is that browsers and assistive technology use page loads as a signal to trigger certain useful behaviours, including announcing the title of the new page or resetting keyboard focus to the beginning of the document.</p>
<p>If you’re an accessibility-conscious developer building a single-page application, you may try to emulate the browser’s behaviour using JavaScript. Gatsby attempts to handle this for you by including a <code>RouteAnnouncer</code> component. This uses an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions"><span>ARIA</span> live region</a> to announce the <code>title</code> or <code>h1</code> of the page, alerting users of screenreader software to navigation changes. This approach, however, is not without its problems: there are still outstanding issues around <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21059">configuration</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20801">localisation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the Single-page applications have inherent accessibility issues around navigation, but it’s worth bearing in mind that using a front-end framework can make other aspects of accessibility harder too. In a February 2020 survey of one million homepages, WebAIM found that those using React had 5.7% more accessibility errors than average; while those using Vue had 25% more<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the frameworks caused these errors, but there’s a strong correlation between more JavaScript and worse accessibility.</p>
<h2>Does a blog even need JavaScript?</h2>
<p>Chances are, the first webpage your ever built performed far better than some of the pages you've built since — it consisted of an <span>HTML</span> file and some <span>CSS</span>; maybe it had a few unoptimised images but they didn’t stop the page from loading. If you're anything like me, the moment you started adding JavaScript was the moment the performance of your webpage took a nosedive. Not all bytes are made equal: an image is going to take far less time to decode and render to the screen than the equivalently sized JavaScript file would take to parse, compile, and execute<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language that can do some incredible things, but it’s incredibly easy to jump to using it too early in development, when you could be using <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span> instead. Consider the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">rule of least power</a>: Don’t use the more powerful language (JavaScript) until you’ve exhausted the capabilities of less powerful languages (<span>HTML</span>). To me, it feels that turning a blog into a JavaScript Single-page application is introducing unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p>I don't want this post to come across as a specific attack on Gatsby. There are some clever people behind it, who’ve acknowledged many of the issues mentioned in this article and are trying to solve them. A statically rendered and hydrated page is still infinitely better than a fully client-side rendered React app (like those generated by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>) which is useless without JavaScript. I do have issues with the way that its JavaScript-heavy, Single page app approach is advertised, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-01-30-why-gatsby-is-better-with-javascript/">including in Gatsby’s own marketing</a>, as appropriate for any kind of website. Client-side JavaScript has a cost and developers should be aware of it.</p>
<h2>Building a Gatsby site with less JavaScript</h2>
<p>This brings me to a dilemma: developing sites with Gatsby is an all-round great experience; but Developer Experience (DX) should always be secondary to User Experience (UX) — how do I build a Gatsby site without the issues inherent in Gatsby’s JavaScript heavy approach? By removing as much of it as possible, of course. Fortunately, there are some fantastic efforts going on within the Gatsby community to build faster, more lightweight sites:</p>
<p>Firstly, you could save a few kilobytes by swapping React for Preact, with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-preact/">gatsby-plugin-preact</a>. I use this on <a href="https://component.gallery/">the Component Gallery</a> and it works seamlessly, instantly knocking ~30kb off the JavaScript payload.</p>
<p>If you want to take a more drastic approach, there's a <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-no-javascript/">plugin which removes <em>all</em> the Gatsby JavaScript from your Gatsby site</a>. Now we’re getting somewhere! You can continue to write react components and GraphQL, even use a CSS-in-JS library (as long as it outputs CSS or inline styles), <em>without</em> sending any JavaScript to the browser. Most of the problems with Gatsby can be solved by throwing out all of its client side JavaScript. <a href="https://gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog.netlify.com/low-tech/">Gatsby Starter Low Tech Blog</a> uses the no-javascript plugin, as well as some other techniques including converting all images to greyscale, to help you create an incredibly lightweight and energy-efficient blog.</p>
<h2>Starting from scratch with Eleventy</h2>
<p>At this point I felt like something was wrong — using a framework that heavily pushes client-side JavaScript, but removing all of that JavaScript seemed like a pretty convoluted way to build a website. I wanted to see whether I could build a fully-featured blog with zero client-side JavaScript and instead of using a plugin to remove it, I wasn’t going to add it in the first place. This is where my other contender comes in:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> encourages you to build your site how you want to. You use the technology you're most comfortable with and it sticks to generating your pages. Eleventy gives you the option of mixing and matching ten different templating languages, including markdown, nunjucks, and liquid; this meant I could copy and paste my old twig templates from Craft, change the file extension, and with some minor tweaks have them running in Eleventy. Instead of adapting my front-end build process to a new bundler I could just drop in my existing webpack file and <code>src</code> folder. Using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently">concurrently</a> package I can run my build script at the same time as Eleventy’s <code>serve</code> process.</p>
<p>Like Gatsby, Eleventy also has an ecosystem of plugins (which is small, but rapidly growing). I’ve picked out a few that I've used which have enabled me to add features without adding client-side JavaScript:</p>
<p>When displaying code snippets in a post, it’s common to include language-specific syntax highlighting. There are a few JavaScript libraries out there that can do it, the most popular of which seems to be <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> — normally you’d run this in the client, but because …</p></div></div>

That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after. From our experience, the cold starts are usually around 400ms.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2><p>In order to serve someone else's model we had to know for sure that the architecture would be robust and scalable.

	<p><em>Starting in 2006 with the Public Health Laboratory Interoperability Project (PHLIP)—one of the first systems that allowed public health entities to exchange standardized data—APHL has worked to make connections between public health laboratories and agencies more efficient. Those efforts took a dramatic step forward with the <a href="https://www.aphl.org/programs/informatics/Pages/aims_platform.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APHL Informatics Messaging Services</a> (AIMS) platform, which has evolved from a one-way router of critical health information to a secure, cloud-based platform that transports, translates, validates and hosts data for federal, state and local public health agencies.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>The emergence of <a href="https://www.aphlblog.org/category/infectious-diseases/covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19</a> required swift action to develop systems and processes that support public health agencies and their pandemic response efforts. In the last seven months, APHL has worked to create new connections, develop new message formats, standardize language and host a variety of solutions to aid in the COVID response. This blog post, regarding exposure notification, is the first in a series that outlines and explains these efforts.</em></p>
<p><strong>How Does Exposure Notification Work?</strong></p>
<p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, information must travel faster than the virus can. The scope and transmission rate of COVID-19 makes this a monumental challenge for public health agencies. Exposure notification technology, however, is a potential game changer. By providing rapid alerts to individuals who may have been in close proximity to someone who has COVID-19, exposure notifications allow the spread of information to stay one step ahead.</p>
<p>Working in conjunction with Apple, Google and Microsoft, APHL is taking a major step to support public health agencies that want to provide focused, privacy-preserving and user-controlled exposure notifications at scale using the Apple | Google Exposure Notifications System. APHL’s presence on the project gives the US public health community a capable and accountable partner for hosting key components of this groundbreaking technology.</p>
<p><strong>The Apple | Google Exposure Notifications System (A|G ENS)</strong></p>
<p>To augment traditional COVID-19 contact tracing efforts around the world, Apple and Google co-developed the A|G ENS, which consists of an Exposure Notification Application Protocol Interface (API) that is available on both the iOS and Android operating systems. Apps developed by public health agencies can then use the Exposure Notification API to help determine if a user may have been exposed to another user who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. This is accomplished through the use of privacy-preserving randomly generated numbers also known as keys, which in turn generate temporary IDs that are transmitted between devices using Bluetooth Low Energy signals. Apps using this system are not permitted to collect or use location data from the device, and user identities are not revealed to other users, Apple, Google or APHL.</p>
<p>Rather than each state and territorial public health agency bearing the burden of building and hosting its own key servers, a national server can securely host the keys of those affected users, eliminate duplication and enable notifications across state borders. APHL is also championing the effort to build and host a national key server on behalf of the public health community. This will allow users to continually benefit from exposure notifications as they travel across state lines, and help state and territorial agencies deploy their apps quickly.</p>
<p>“APHL’s participation is key to the success of these efforts,” said Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “Without a national key server, each state that chooses to implement such an application would be responsible for its own data sets. APHL’s centralized and secure national server will be accessible to every state public health agency.”</p>
<p>Microsoft is supporting the partnership by working with APHL to host the national key server, based on the open source reference design created by Google Cloud. Through Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, Microsoft will provide cloud services that will allow APHL to host the key server and securely enable interstate operability for the apps that public health agencies deploy.</p>
<p>Only users who choose to download an app developed by their public health agency and voluntarily opt in can receive exposure notifications. If users are alerted to a possible exposure, the app will also provide information about what to do next.</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with Apple, Google and Microsoft to make this groundbreaking technology accessible to state and territorial public health agencies,” Bill Whitmar, president of APHL and director of the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, said. “Apps using this technology will rapidly inform users of a potential exposure to COVID-19 and provide them information they can use to protect themselves and their families.”</p>
<p><em>APHL develops technological innovations that support public health agencies at the federal, state and local level.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3><strong>Understanding Kubernetes</strong></h3><p>The objective of this article is to provide an introduction and a general understanding about Kubernetes. We will look into architectural concepts, advantages of using Kubernetes, how to set up Kubernetes, and how to run commands on a local machine using Minikube.</p><h3><strong>What is Kubernetes?</strong></h3><p>Before we dive deep into Kubernetes, let's first understand the concept of containers. Containerization is the process of packaging code and dependencies of an application into a single image, and running it in a single computing environment called the container.</p><p><strong>Docker</strong> revolutionized containerization by packaging software into a virtual container that can run on any environment. With containers, one can deploy applications onto multiple platforms like AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean.&nbsp;</p><p>But challenges arise when the number of containers increases. It becomes difficult to deploy and maintain hundreds of containers across many servers or VM instances. This led to the evolution of the <strong>container orchestration software</strong>.</p><p>An orchestrator’s role is to coordinate a set of container workloads across a series of servers or nodes. This includes things like making sure the containers have the right resources, the correct number of containers are available at all times, rolling deploys to prevent uptime, and more. <strong>Kubernetes</strong> is the most popular container orchestrator.</p><p>Kubernetes, also known as k8s, was released in 2015 by Google and is now maintained by an open-source community (of which Google is also a part of). Kubernetes provides a set of APIs and command-line interfaces to manage containers deployed across servers. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of the containers across clusters of hosts. This makes it a popular choice to host microservice-based implementations as it addresses many concerns of microservice implementations like configuration management, service discovery, and job scheduling.</p><p>Apart from the core Kubernetes implementation , there are many versions/flavors of Kubernetes implementation provided by various cloud services and distributions that conform to the Kubernetes spec.</p><h3><strong>Kubernetes Architecture</strong></h3><p>Let’s look at the components of Kubernetes architecture</p><h4><strong>Kubectl</strong></h4><p>We communicate with Kubernetes through its API. The popular tool that is used for this is called Kubectl (pronounced <em>cube control or cube CTL</em>).</p><h4><strong>Node</strong></h4><p>A single server in a Kubernetes cluster is known as a node. Workloads are assigned from the control plane, or master to the nodes. The various components of a node server are:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Container Runtime:</strong> The container runtime runs and manages applications present in the containers. The container runtime is usually Docker although it supports other container runtimes like Containerd.</li><li><strong>Kubelet:</strong> Kubelet is a container that runs as an agent on each node to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane (master node). Kubelet also makes sure that the <em>pods</em> (basic unit of deployment) running in a node are healthy and running based on the YAML file called Podspec.</li><li><strong>Kube-proxy:</strong> A proxy service that runs on each of the node servers that performs tasks like forwarding correct requests to containers and make services available to other components.</li></ol><h4><strong>Control Plane</strong></h4><p>The Control plane, also known as the <em>master,</em> is in charge of managing the Kubernetes cluster. It is a group of containers and each one of them does a single job. These components make the decisions that are applicable to the whole cluster like scheduling, detecting and responding to cluster events. The various components of the control plane are</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>etcd: </strong>An important concern of a microservice architecture is that the configuration data should be kept isolated from the code and be accessible. etcd is the Kubernetes component which is a persistent, lightweight, and distributed key-value data store which stores configuration data that represents the state of the cluster.</li><li><strong>API server: </strong>As<strong> </strong>mentioned, Kubernetes consists of a set of APIs. This API is served using JSON over HTTP by the component in the control plane known as the API server. It provides interfaces to Kubernetes and is the API server that updates the states of API objects in etcd, allowing clients to configure workloads and containers across nodes</li><li><strong>Scheduler: </strong>The scheduler is the component of the control plane which assigns unassigned workloads(pods) to the nodes in the cluster. The scheduler tracks the states of the nodes and ensures that workload is equally distributed.</li><li><strong>Controller manager: </strong>The controllers are the components that work to turn the state of the cluster to the user’s desire. It creates updates and deletes resources in the controller. These controllers include ReplicationController, JobsController, and DaemonSet Controller. The controller manager is the component that manages all these controllers.</li></ol><h3><strong>Kubernetes Objects</strong></h3><p>Kubernetes provides layers of abstractions over the container to provide mechanisms that deploy, maintain and scale applications. So the users will interact with the primitives provided by the Kubernetes object instead of directly communicating with the containers. Let’s take a look at the different types of objects available in Kubernetes.</p><h4><strong>Pods</strong></h4><p>A pod is made up of one or more containers running in a node. It is the basic unit of a deployment. Containers are not directly deployed in Kubernetes. They are deployed as pods. A pod is usually one or more containers that are controlled as a single application. Each pod is assigned a unique IP address known as Pod IP. The containers inside the pod can address each other on localhost, but a container has to use a Pod IP to address a container inside a different pod. Various operations can be performed on pods by the controllers that are managed by the Controller manager</p><h4><strong>Replica Set</strong></h4><p>When working with Kubernetes, we may have to replicate our pods and manage them for scaling purposes. For example, we may decide that we want three instances of our API running at all times. This is achieved by using ReplicaSets. A ReplicaSet is a grouping set that maintains replicas that are declared for a pod by the user. ReplicaSet maintains a stable set of copies of a pod that are always available.</p><h4><strong>Services</strong></h4><p>A set of pods that work together is known as a Service in Kubernetes. The pods are defined by a semantic tag called a Label. The Service discovery component assigns an IP address and DNS name to the service, and load balances traffic into pods that match the selector label. Service discovery can be based on environmental variables or using Kubernetes DNS. An example for this is backend pods grouped into a service with requests from frontend load-balanced among them.</p><h4><strong>Deployments</strong></h4><p>Deployments are one of the most important objects in Kubernetes. Deployment does the process of changing the actual state of the objects to the desired state of the user at a controlled rate. Deployments can adjust the replica sets, change the versions of the applications, etc by changing the configurations of the cluster.</p><p>There are two ways to deploy pods, by using the command line and by using a YAML file. We will look into this in detail in a later section.</p><h4><strong>Volumes</strong></h4><p>By default, an ephemeral storage is provided by filesystem in Kubernetes, meaning a pod restart will wipe out all the data in the containers. This is a problem for applications that require persistent storage.&nbsp;</p><p>A volume provides persistent storage for the data in the pods. Volumes can be mounted at a specific path within containers, by defining them in the pod configuration. The same volume can be shared between all containers in the same pod.</p><h4><strong>StatefulSets</strong></h4><p>One of the main challenges faced by a container orchestrator is the preservation of the state. In case of a pod restart or if the application is scaled up or down, the state may need to be redistributed. Also, the ordering of instances is important. An example of a stateful workload is a database. StatefulSets controller is used for managing the stateful applications and enforces properties of uniqueness and ordering amongst instances of a pod.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>DaemonSets</strong></h4><p>Usually, the location where pods are run is determined by the scheduler. But some pods need to be run on every single node of the cluster for use cases like log collection and storage services. This kind of pod scheduling is implemented by the feature called DaemonSet.</p><h3><strong>Kubernetes Local Install</strong></h3><p>Because Kubernetes defines a set of APIs and expected behavior, there are multiple implementations, one of which is a tool called minikube. Minikube allows you to run a Kubernetes cluster on your local machine, which makes it easy to spin up complex services or even test your deployments locally.&nbsp; Before we start the installation, we can quickly look at some of the other options available.</p><p><strong>Docker Desktop:</strong> If you are already using Docker Desktop, Kubernetes can be easily enabled in it by clicking the ‘Enable Kubernetes’ checkbox in the Kubernetes tab.</p><p><strong>MicroK8s</strong>: MicroK8S is developed by Canonical. Although it was made for Ubuntu, it now supports various other Linux distros and recently started support in Windows and Mac.</p><p><strong>Running Kubernetes In Browser</strong>: If you don't want to install Kubernetes in your local system, you can learn it in a browser. There are two options <a href="https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/">&nbsp;Play with K8s</a> and<a href="https://www.katacoda.com/"> Katacoda</a></p><h4><strong>Minikube</strong></h4><p>Minkube is the version we will be running. Minikube will run a single node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine.</p><p><strong>Steps to Install Minikube</strong></p><ol role="list"><li>As a first step make sure that Docker is properly installed in your system, as Docker is used for creating, managing, and controlling the containers.</li><li>The next step is that we need a virtual machine or hypervisor in our system like Virtualbox, HyperKit, or KVM..</li></ol><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For macOS</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Install Virtualbox for Mac using Homebrew</p><blockquote>brew cask install virtualbox<strong><br></strong></blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>For Linux</strong></p><blockquote>sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack</blockquote><p>3. The next step is to make sure that the CLI tool Kubectl is installed.</p><p><strong>For macOS</strong></p><blockquote>brew install kubectl<br></blockquote><p><strong>For Linux</strong></p><p>Download the latest version</p><blockquote>curl -LO …</blockquote></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of its metal life, it was just the <i>Third core</i>, as it was the third in the family. Here is the entire family of plutonium cores, dressed up in fashionable magnesium casings:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg" alt="First-three-Pu-cores" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores.jpg 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores-300x200.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/First-three-Pu-cores-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>The oldest one is on the left, the <i>Gadget core</i>. It exploded at the Trinity test site in the first-ever atomic blast.</p><p>The younger brother is in the middle, the <i>Fat Man core</i>. It exploded over Nagasaki and killed 40,000-80,000 Japanese civilians.</p><p>Missing from these pictures is the <i>Little Boy core</i>, the black sheep in the family. A fat blob made of 64kg of uranium, it dwarfed smaller 6.2kg plutonium cores. But as black sheeps often do, it achieved the biggest fame. It exploded over Hiroshima.</p><p>On the right is the youngest and the hero of our story. Actually, the photo only shows its magnesium casing; the third core was busy elsewhere. Japan surrendered in August 1945, and there were no plans for another atomic bombing. So it was used at the Los Alamos lab for criticality experiments:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg" alt="Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere" width="471" height="363" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere.jpeg 471w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere-300x231.jpeg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Partially-reflected-plutonium-sphere-389x300.jpeg 389w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></a></p><p>Its future seemed quite boring compared to its older brothers, but the Third core had its own plans. The first accident happened on August 21, 1945.</p><p>To understand what happened, we need to understand what a criticality experiment is. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass" target="_blank">critical mass</a> is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. All plutonium cores are built dangerously close to that limit. The Third core was at 95% of its critical mass. So it was safe; you could use it for bowling if you wanted. But this is the trick: you can make it go critical by compressing it with high explosives, which are used in implosion-type nuclear bombs. However, blowing stuff up is not very practical in lab environments, as you need your core and your scientists to be undamaged for the next experiment. In Los Alamos, they used neutron reflectors to simulate the first nanoseconds before the explosion. Surround part of the core with tungsten carbide bricks, and they reflect neutrons back in. The same core is now 96% critical. Keep adding bricks around, like Legos, and you will reach 97% and 98% criticality. One more brick, and you will be at 99%. One percent away from an uncontrolled chain reaction. But this is a mechanical, simple procedure done by the smartest physicists in the country. What can go wrong?</p><p>That day in August, physicist Harry Daghlian was doing a criticality experiment. He was alone, with a security guy sitting at a nearby desk. He started adding bricks and measuring the resulting radiation. Understanding the thin border of criticality is crucial. The faster the criticality happens, the better yield a nuclear weapon has. He was quite close to the border when a funny thing happened. The tungsten carbide brick slipped from his sweaty hand and fell on the core. The room started glowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized-air_glow" target="_blank">electric blue</a>. While Harry was panickingly disassembling the pile of bricks, the security guy was asking himself, what the hell is happening? It lasted only a few seconds before the hot core was stripped naked, and the reaction stopped. All was silent. The two men reported to the hospital soon after. Harry Daghlian died 25 days later from acute radiation syndrome. Private Robert Hemmerly died 33 years later from leukemia.</p><p>This accident caused quite a stir in Los Alamos. Protocols were put in place to prevent future accidents. During lunch in the canteen, scientists would imagine mental experiments in which the core would go critical again. What is better–to quickly dismantle the core apparatus or to run away as fast as you can? If you leave slightly critical core, it would melt on the laboratory floor, and the reaction would stop. Of course, it takes more seconds to run out of the lab than to manually stop the reaction, but the calculation is not so simple. Radiation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">falls rapidly with the square of the distance</a>, so with every step you run, the situation becomes much less dangerous. As real geeks, they calculated that prompt manual dismantling is the best choice because you just can’t run fast enough.</p><p>One of the physicists at those lunches was Louis Slotin. He was a young and cocky Canadian, often seen in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots. Not only he was unafraid, but fiddling with core also gave him a kick. In the new experiment, they ditched the bricks and replaced them with a neutron-reflecting beryllium half-sphere. If the core is completely covered, it goes critical. Therefore, mechanical spacers are put into place to ensure that the half-sphere only covers a certain percentage of it. Louis didn’t like spacers. He would perform criticality measurements holding a half-sphere top thumb hole with his left hand and holding it in position with a screwdriver in his right hand:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg" alt="Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail" width="471" height="349" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail.jpg 471w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail-300x222.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tickling_the_Dragons_Tail-405x300.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillation_counter" target="_blank">scintillation counter</a> on the side would show how far he could go. It was immediate and much faster than using spacers. Slotin called it “twisting the dragon’s tail” and performed it over a dozen times in front of spectating scientists. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi" target="_blank">Enrico Fermi</a> reportedly told Slotin and others that they would be “dead within a year” if they continued performing it.</p><p>On May 21, 1946, Louis was preparing to twist the dragon’s tail in a room with eight other people. Everything was going nicely. He slowly covered the core with a beryllium half-sphere until it was almost enclosed. The scintillation counter was happily ticking, and Louis was controlling the neutron-escaping gap with his screwdriver. Suddenly&nbsp;the tip of the screwdriver slipped, and everybody heard the metal cling of the half-sphere closing. The room filled with the blue light. Louis hastily kicked the half-sphere. The blue light was replaced with a deadly silence. They quickly left the room. After 10 minutes, they all decided to go back. With a piece of chalk, they marked where everybody stood at the moment of criticality. They were scientists, after all; this unplanned experiment would offer a rare opportunity to measure the effects of radiation poisoning on eight human subjects of varying age and varying distance from the radiation source. After diagramming, they reported to the sick bay. The first result followed soon, as Louis Slotin died nine days later. Others survived, but suffered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#Second_incident" target="_blank">various radiation-related illnesses</a>.</p><p>Nothing happened to the core, except for the name change. Older cores that killed more than 130,000 people far across the Pacific still had cute names like the <em>Little Boy</em> and the <em>Fat Man</em>. But with two dead colleagues, everybody at Los Alamos started calling this one the <i>Demon core</i>. Hands-on criticality experiments were halted and replaced with remote-control machines supervised from a quarter-mile distance.</p><p>Ultimately, it was decided to destroy the Demon core in a nuclear blast–for both the scientific value and publicity purposes. Marshall islands were chosen as the location of the first nuclear test where press and selected audience members were allowed. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#Test_Able" target="_blank">first of three planned explosions</a>, the Demon core was to be dropped from a plane over a fleet of 95 decommissioned target ships. The zero point was a few hundred meters was above the <em>USS Nevada</em>, which had been painted bright red for targeting purposes:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg" alt="640px-USS_Nevada_(BB-36)_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship" width="640" height="379" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship.jpg 640w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship-300x178.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/640px-USS_Nevada_BB-36_Operation_Crossroads_Target_Ship-500x296.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p><p>On July 1, 1946, as 114 journalists were waiting for an atomic explosion, the rough expectation was for nine ships (including two battleships and an aircraft carrier) to be sunk. Again, the Demon core had other plans. For reasons still unknown, the bomb missed the target by 650 meters. When the plutonium imploded and went critical, it was too far away to do any real damage. The test was a flop, and the press was disappointed. <i>The New York Times</i> reported that of all of the ships, “only two were sunk, one capsized, and eighteen damaged.”</p><p>The curse didn’t stop with the demise of the Demon core. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#Test_Baker" target="_blank">second test</a> seemed more certain, as it was an underwater blast. The position was certain, and water carries more blast energy. On July 25th, a bomb named <i>Baker</i> was detonated 27 meters below the sea’s surface. Here is the photo (click for a large version); notice a black hole where the 27,000-ton battleship <i>USS Arkansas</i> was:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-1024x537.jpg" alt="Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large" width="584" height="306" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-300x157.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baker-Nuclear-Test-Large-500x262.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p><p>The blast was a success, but the events after were far from that. Because of the underwater nature of the test, all radioactive fission products remained in close proximity. The entire lagoon and target ships were radioactively contaminated. Ships were needed for a third test, so Navy fireboats were sent to do decontamination. They soon discovered that hosing down ships with water from the lagoon (also radioactive) didn’t help much. The Navy then sent 4900 sailors who tried scrubbing ships with water, soap, and lye:</p><p><a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg" alt="Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown" width="600" height="480" srcset="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown.jpg 600w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown-300x240.jpg 300w, https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crossroads_Baker_Scrubdown-375x300.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p>It didn’t work. The ships were still radioactive, and even worse, plutonium was everywhere. They caught a surgeonfish that had ingested enough plutonium to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads#/media/File:Crossroads_Radioactive_Puffy_Surgeon_Fish.jpg" target="_blank">its own x-ray on a film</a>, without an x-ray apparatus. On August 10th, decontamination was canceled. The third test was never performed, and most of the target fleet was brought to open sea and sunk. So instead of being a demonstration of the US’s nuclear superiority, these two tests demonstrated that the US army couldn’t hit the target, estimate the fallout, or perform the cleanup.</p><p>This should be the end of the story of the misbehaved plutonium. But it is not, as it continues with the strangest twist.</p><p>That same year, in faraway France, two men were competing to push the boundaries of female fashion. After WW2, the feeling of liberation was in the air, for both sexual freedom and for a new, emancipated role of females in society. They both came to a similar idea–a two-piece swimsuit that covers only the minimum. Jacques Heim launched his swimsuit in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Heim#Career" target="_blank">June 1946</a>, a few weeks before the Demon core exploded. Appropriately for the spirit of the times, he called it <i>Atome</i> and marketed as “the world’s smallest bathing suit.” This would not be for long because a few weeks later, Louis Réard, another Frenchman, decided to go even further. He concluded that there is no place for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel#Society_and_culture" target="_blank">belly button taboo</a> in the “atomic age.” On July 5th, 1946 he …</p></div></div>

          <p><img src="https://forum.intercoin.org/uploads/default/original/1X/eb4018ded8d596349cb201267f7e18f5fa03785a.png" alt="" width="613" height="130"></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Intercoin Inc. is finishing its work developing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to allow any project to raise money to build their network, issue their own utility tokens, give them to their backers, peg them to fiat, and get unlimited and fair liquidity for them. No one would have to pay a lot to get onto a centralized exchange, because the whole thing could be launched on the permissionless Ethereum blockchain just as one can launch a website on the Web. Merchants on the platform would be able to accept the tokens, and cash them out, selling them to the next customers.  Token holders everywhere will push others to buy and accept the tokens, growing the network effect of the project.</p>
<p>This can finally realize the original dream of permissionless, trustless networks that are owned by the participants, rather than centralized platforms extracting rents forever on behalf of the original investors and developers. It will transition our society’s innovation engine from competition to collaboration, like we see with open source, wikipedia, and science. People will be compensated <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/">fairly</a>. Open source software and journalism can be monetized. And all this can be done without fear of regulators coming after the issuers of the tokens. This is not a fantasy! This is the environment our new DeFi product, the Utility Token Contract, will bring about.</p>
<p><strong>The Landscape Today</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is all the rage in 2020, with investors funding many projects to create financial applications that don’t require trusting any centralized party. This reflects a <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/10/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase/">general trend, that Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures has pointed out</a>, that new applications beget new infrastructure (web3.js) which lets the industry build better apps.</p>
<p>It’s especially great the industry is thinking in terms of composability of components. <a href="https://our.status.im/whats-with-defi-and-money-legos/">DeFi has been called “money LEGOs”</a> which warms our heart – we have been building social media LEGOs since 2011 under <a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/company-qbix-inc-3736553-page-1-2">a company whose logo is building blocks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/07/14/ethereum-is-beating-bitcoin-in-more-ways-than-one/">Ethereum has emerged as the dominant platform</a> for building DeFi applications today. The number of active addresses on Ethereum has doubled just since the start of 2020, while Bitcoin’s has only grown by 50%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The level of development on ethereum is crazy: initial coin offerings, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, decentralized exchanges and other decentralized finance applications, Web 3 use cases,” <em>- Messari chief executive Ryan Selkis</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current DeFi solutions have centered largely around stablecoins and lending, with all the use cases that go with it. Stablecoins like USDT and DAI have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-market-caps-7-billion-volumes-most-pairs/">outstripped most trading pairs in trading volume</a>, as people want to hold crypto assets pegged to their favorite fiat currency. Lending platforms like Celsius recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/celsius-network-secures-us10m-equity-raise-with-tether-as-lead-investor-301081105.html">raised a $30MM equity round with Tether as a lead investor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Filling a Crucial Need: Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p>With all the excitement surrounding DeFi, people seem to have given up on the initial dream that started it all: utility tokens that powerful countries would not regulate as securities. Let’s recall some of the benefits everyone was pointing out a mere 4 years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network would be <a href="https://avc.com/2016/01/network-equity/">owned by the participants</a> rather than those who launched it</li>
<li>We could finally <a href="https://qbix.com/QBUX/whitepaper.html#Monetizing-Open-Source">monetize open source projects</a> and <a href="https://qbix.com/blog/2016/11/17/properly-valuing-contributions/">properly value contributions</a>
</li>
<li>We could <a href="https://qbix.com/QBUX/whitepaper.html#Monetizing-and-Personalizing-Content">rescue journalism</a> and monetize other online content <a href="https://digiday.com/media/marc-andreessen-ad-tech-fueled-race-bottom-failed-publishers/">without ads</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea went that utility tokens would be obtained in order to be used, not held for speculative purposes of resale in the future. FileCoin would be used to pay for storing and serving files. Ethereum would be used to pay for transactions on a world computer. The initial development would be financed by pre-selling securities (<a href="https://saftproject.com/static/SAFT-Project-Whitepaper.pdf">remember the SAFT?</a>) that promised the holder a certain number of tokens once the network was up and running. Many analysts were very <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-saft-is-a-reasonable-approach-to-securities-law-when-preselling-useful-network-tokens/">bullish on this idea</a>. Even notable crypto curmudgeon Preston Byrne <a href="https://prestonbyrne.com/2017/08/04/thoughts-on-the-saft/">admitted it could be a workable model</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Regulators Strike Back, Return of the Utility Token</strong></p>
<p>Then the regulators created an atmosphere of uncertainty, thorough their messaging and enforcement, and the industry gave up on its dream of crypto-currency transforming the way we fund new projects. We were there, we saw it happen. But since 2018, there have been significant new developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>June 14, 2018: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418">SEC’s Director William Hinman gave a speech</a> where he explicitly compared utility tokens to oranges in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp">SEC vs Howey</a>, expressing hope that one day we can have true utility tokens go mainstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>April 3, 2019: The SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">issues its first No-Action Letter</a> allowing  TurnKey Jet, Inc. to issue bona fide utility tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 19, 2019: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-how-we-howey-050919">SEC’s Commissioner Hester Pierce</a> expressed clear interest in allowing forbearance and sandboxes to allow new innovation and opportunities in crypto to develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>July 25, 2019: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">SEC issues a second No-Action Letter</a>, this time to Pocketful of Quarters, Inc. that goes further than TurnKey Jet, and allows approved and KYC-ed service providers to exchange the tokens for ETH at predetermined exchange rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor for Utility Tokens</strong></p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/pocketful-quarters-inc-072519-2a1">no-action letters</a> have created a safe harbor for issuers of utility tokens, that can fit within the requirements spelled out in the letters. They are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PoQ will not use any funds from Quarters sales to build the Quarters Platform, which has been fully developed and will be fully functional and operational immediately upon its launch and before any of the Quarters are sold;</li>
<li>the Quarters will be immediately usable for their intended purpose (gaming) at the time they are sold;</li>
<li>PoQ will implement technological and contractual provisions governing the Quarters and the Quarters Platform that restrict the transfer of Quarters to PoQ or to wallets on the Quarters Platform;</li>
<li>gamers will only be able to transfer Quarters from their Quarters Hot Wallets for gameplay to addresses of Developers with Approved Accounts or to PoQ in connection with participation in e-sports tournaments;</li>
<li>only Developers and Influencers with Approved Accounts will be capable of exchanging Quarters for ETH at pre-determined exchange rates by transferring their Quarters to the Quarters Smart Contract;</li>
<li>to create an Approved Account, Developers and Influencers will be subject to KYC / AML checks at account initiation as well as on an ongoing basis;</li>
<li>Quarters will be made continuously available to gamers in unlimited quantities at a fixed price;</li>
<li>there will be a correlation between the purchase price of Quarters and the market price of accessing and interacting with Participating Games; and</li>
<li>PoQ will market and sell Quarters to gamers solely for consumptive use as a means of accessing and interacting with Participating Games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Level 1: The Utility Token Contract</strong></p>
<p>We set out to build a smart contract which neatly fits all the above criteria, about which Hester Pierce said the transactions are <em>“so clearly <em>not</em> an offer of securities that I worry the staff’s issuance of a digital token no-action letter… may in fact have the effect of broadening the perceived reach of our securities laws. If these tokens  <em>were</em>  securities, it would be hard to distinguish them from any medium of stored value.”</em></p>
<p>Suppose you are building a new network of buyers and sellers, and you want to launch a new token <strong>X</strong> for your ecosystem. The Utility Token Contract is designed to issue an unlimited amount of <strong>X</strong> and make it available to buy at a fixed price with a stablecoin (such as 1 USDT or 1 DAI). Anyone can buy <strong>X</strong> simply by sending USDT to the contract, and receiving the corresponding amount of <strong>X</strong> in return. They can also sell each <strong>X</strong> to the contract in exchange for a discount, say 0.9 USDT.</p>
<p>As long as the smart contract always sells each minted <strong>X</strong> for 1 USDT, it will always have enough USDT to buy back the tokens. Moreover, no rational buyer would spend more than $1 for <strong>X</strong> when they can buy it in unlimited quantities from the contract. Similarly, no rational seller would accept less than 90 cents for each <strong>X</strong> since they can sell it back to the contract.</p>
<p>However, “market makers” could appear, who trade within the narrow range, buying for 98 cents and selling for 92 cents, for example. This creates an opportunity for more entities to buy and sell the token, without making the token itself a security.</p>
<p>There is no need to pay a centralized exchange to get the token listed, if the contract is always standing ready to buy or sell. But because merchants and others who accept <strong>X</strong> will only get 90 cents instead of $1 if they send it to the contract, everyone holding <strong>X</strong> will be asking their employees and suppliers to start accepting some payments in <strong>X</strong> as well, increasing its network effect and overall market cap. Have you ever asked people to consider taking payment in Bitcoin or Ethereum? That’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2: Pre-Selling the Token</strong></p>
<p>Although our Utility Token Contract, as described above, would already benefit any existing project, we can go further.  Because the project deploying the smart contract becomes its owner, they will be able to tell the contract to mint some <strong>X</strong> and send it to specific addresses for free.</p>
<p>The project can use this ability to pre-sell some of the tokens using a SAFT (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-saft-is-a-reasonable-approach-to-securities-law-when-preselling-useful-network-tokens/">which is a security transaction</a>), and once people begin buying <strong>X</strong> from the contract to use for utility purposes, the contract owner can start to tell the contract to give out <strong>X</strong> tokens, which have real value because the network is up and running, with at least one merchant (the project itself) willing to provide services.</p>
<p>However, giving out too many tokens can create an imbalance in the issuing contract, where the contract does not have enough USDT to buy back all the <strong>X</strong> outstanding. This is a situation similar to fractional reserve banking: since not everyone is going to demand all the <strong>X</strong> at once, the contract can in fact hold smaller reserves of USDT to <strong>X</strong>. It starts out with a 10% surplus, and may go down to an 80% deficit (20% reserves.)</p>
<p>Since buyers of <strong>X</strong> would naturally be concerned about this situation, each …</p></div></div>

In this post, we will deep dive into why using traditional area definitions is not a good idea to carry out geospatial analysis.</p><h2 id="maps-don-t-always-tell-the-truth-">Maps don’t always tell the truth!</h2><p>Based on intuitive logic, companies either go with a zip-code boundary or some hand-drawn neighbourhood boundaries to map their most critical metrics like market potential, utilisation, average customer value, etc. These form an important part of decisions like what areas to expand into, shoot promotions in, or provision more supply.</p><p>Now, if you’re a business with little or no intra-city operations, the difference might not be significant to you. But if you provide services in the last mile or at a hyperlocal level, the differences in insights have a significant impact on the decisions that the business and city teams use.</p><p><em>Which brings me to the next question: <strong>Why is this difference significant?</strong></em></p><p>Often what happens is the zip codes or arbitrarily defined neighbourhood boundaries that the nuances that the different areas depict tend to get dissolved.</p><blockquote>In other words, a zip code that we treat as one big cell for analysis consists of many smaller cells without any similarity in demographics or economic potential.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*uI0tq7P1PGDpJEwP"><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>This is illustrated by the fact that, if you live in Palo Alto, you are a part of the world’s foremost innovation hub and are paying median home prices of $1.18 million. However, just right across the train tracks, 18% percent of East Palo Alto residents live below the poverty line where the average yearly income per person is $18,385.</p><blockquote>The characteristic behaviour of these two areas would be very different and while they would be present in the data that you collect, they often aren’t so easy to unearth.</blockquote><p>In the next section, we would like to show you how easily the maps can lie and why different members in your team recommend completely different areas in a city to focus on based on the same set of metrics!</p><hr><h3 id="nyc-city-manager-s-woes">NYC City Manager’s Woes</h3><p>Let’s consider that you are Uber’s city manager, and want to run contextual promotions and discounts in areas where you have high market potential or market share. For this exercise, we used the Uber Cab dataset available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city#uber-raw-data-apr14.csv">here</a> and the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset available <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2014-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/gn7m-em8n">here</a>. Now, we can simply define market-potential as</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/image.png"></figure><p>For our area definitions, we choose the <a href="ttps://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34204-geojson.json">NYC housing areas</a> and <a href="https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/download/file/nyu-2451-34509-geojson.json">NYC zip-code areas</a>. Using these two area definitions, we calculate the market potential and here's the plot:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/zip_vs_house-1.png" alt="Left and Right show M.P by Zip-Code and Housing areas respectively."><figcaption>Left and Right show M.P by Zip-Code and Housing areas respectively</figcaption></figure><p><em>Greener means more Market Potential for Uber and pinker means it is already doing well in that area.</em> When we try to filter areas by M.P greater than 70% to identify the top areas to run promotions in, we see the following areas:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/zip_vs_house_60.png"><figcaption>Areas with Market Potential greater than 70%</figcaption></figure><p>The areas we got are quite different! </p><h3 id="modifiable-areal-unit-problem">Modifiable Areal Unit Problem</h3><p>Hence, it is safe to conclude that the decision completely changes based on what set of boundaries we use for our analysis. This is a classical problem in geospatial data science known as the <em>Modifiable Areal Unit Problem </em>(MAUP).</p><blockquote>Because of the MAUP problem, our decision becomes reliant on the shape and size of the area instead of the actual characteristics of the users within it.</blockquote><p>The ideal area should have the ideal shape and size. Let’s consider finding that ideal shape. We could divide the geographic plane into squares of the same size, or maybe triangles, pentagons, or something else! We at Locale use hexagons instead of any other shape and you can get a glimpse of why here:</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/locale-ai/spatial-modelling-tidbits-honeycomb-or-fishnets-68a453ac455e"><div><p>Spatial Modelling Tidbits: Honeycomb or Fishnets?</p><p>If you are a two-degree marketplace like Uber, you cater to millions of users requesting a ride through your driver partners accepting and fulfilling those requests.

Uber has a well-suited library that converts lat, longs to hexes of a given size. You can find out more about it <a href="https://eng.uber.com/h3/" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>From the visualization, we can see the distribution of Market Potential across the city in a much uniform way. We can filter these hexagons by market potential to get the best area to run promotions in.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/hexes.png"><figcaption>Market Potential by Hexagonal areas</figcaption></figure><p>Another way to reduce more bias would be to not bind locations to areas initially which leads to our next section.</p><hr><h2 id="enter-geo-spatial-clustering-">Enter, Geo-spatial Clustering!</h2><p>The idea is to let data decide what the significant areas are on which MP should ideally be computed.

Then, we compute the convex hull of these areas to get area boundaries. Now, we have areas generated from the data itself, suitable for computing MP in a reduced human-bias way. Again, we filter by areas where M.P is more than 70% and get these places:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/05/infered_60.png"><figcaption>Hotspots detected by our algorithm with highest Market Potentials.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth noting that a simple density-based approach can work here because of the nature and definition of the problem.</p><blockquote>Since we consider only locations, a density-based spatial clustering extracts the underlying areas which are more closely knit in terms of the user behaviour.</blockquote><p>For this decision to be actually reliable for a business use case, instead of using just one metric, we take a set of metrics that largely affect the user behaviour in one area. For example, office-goers in an area vs university students might show completely different travel patterns.</p><p>Now, as highlighted here, using the automated learning techniques for similarity and clustering analyses that we have built at Locale.ai, our algorithms work hard to find what areas behave similarly based on the metrics that you care about (growth potential, unit economics, power users) and show you what areas to focus on for each unit of your business.</p><p>This enables you to save or export these<strong><em> areas profiles</em></strong> and keep reusing them for different kinds of analysis and then track them to maximize your revenue, demand and profitability in each of those areas rather than using arbitrarily defined boundaries.</p><p><em>The complete experiment along with the code is available <a href="https://github.com/localeai/Modifiable-Areal-Unit-Problem">here</a>. Feel free to experiment with some other dataset!</em></p><hr><p>If you’ve reached this far, here is a sneak peek into why this forms the base of our entire platform and what all techniques we have developed on top of this:</p><h3 id="similarity-analysis-and-feature-importance">Similarity Analysis and Feature Importance</h3><p>Our geospatial models not only find clusters of areas having unique characteristic, but also tell us why the area is unique. Hence, while identifying clusters of areas based on a combination of metrics, it also pin points the factors that have the most significant impact on these metrics. </p><blockquote>Two different areas don’t necessarily have to be close in order to behave similarly. You can probably use one as a test area to observe and apply the same strategies across cities.</blockquote><h3 id="real-time-monitoring-with-anomaly-detection">Real-time Monitoring with Anomaly Detection</h3><p>It doesn’t make sense is not quite enough to just know that SLAs are not being met only in Bangalore or SFO. Knowing where orders are getting delayed or cancelled, or whether an abnormally high delay in an area is caused by a sudden supply drop because of rain can be very valuable.</p><blockquote>Adding the context of location along with anomalies can make the insights very actionable for us and makes decision-making very simple.</blockquote><hr><p>At Locale, we are building an analytics and visualization product to help city and business teams get precise, real-time insights about how their operations perform without any compromises and dependencies. <em><em>then get in touch for a demo <a href="https://www.locale.ai/" rel="noopener">here</a> or get in touch with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-sinha-6b774ba9/" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/aditi1002" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">Twitter</a>.</em></em></p><h3 id="read-similar-">Read Similar:</h3><figure><a href="https://blog.locale.ai/geospatial-autocorrelation/"><div><p>Spatial Autocorrelation: Close Objects Affecting Other Close&nbsp;Objects</p><p>Deep dive into spatial autocorrelation and their industry use&nbsp;cases</p><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/favicon.png"><span>Anubhav Pattnaik</span><span>Locale.ai</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/0_m9ZlJLgXoW2u5R0S.jpg"></p></a></figure>

<p>On July 15 2020, between 20:00 to 22:00 UTC, up to one hundred and thirty <strong>high-profile</strong> Twitter accounts were compromised.</p>



<p>Some affected accounts included Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Jeff Bezos, alongside cryptocurrency accounts like CoinBase and Binance. The majority of accounts had over one million followers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/36698-68549-200715-TwitterHack-xl.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple's tweet"><figcaption>Tweet from Apple’s official Twitter account</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since this is a developing situation, we don’t know anything for certain. With that in mind, here is a summary of what we think we know so far.</p>



<p>As you can see from the image above, the scam involved trusted accounts claiming to double the amount of any bitcoin sent to a certain address.</p>



<p>Many different bitcoin addresses were used, and one address reportedly gained the equivalent of over $110,000.</p>



<h2>how did this happen?</h2>



<p>It is difficult to believe that such a well-known platform could be breached in such a way that goes undetected until hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage have been caused. With such a popular social network, you’d think the security is unbeatable.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s try to break it down.</strong></p>



<p>On the day of the attack, <a href="http://vice.com/">Vice</a> was contacted by a group claiming to be responsible for the attack, who said they paid a Twitter employee to give them access to an administrative tool that allowed them to change account’s settings which would allow them to get around security practices such as Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for these accounts.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t necessarily a reliable source.</p>



<figure><img src="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 738w, https://discsec.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-300x80.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px"><figcaption>Tweet from Twitter’s official support account</figcaption></figure>



<p>This tweet (above) from Twitter’s official support account suggests that a social engineering attack was used to gain access to “internal systems and tools” — similar to the “administrative tool” mentioned above.</p>



<p>Social engineering is when you trick a person (in this case a twitter employee) into compromising their own system. This can be through many methods. A common example of social engineering is telephone scammers, which are, for example, when someone calls you pretending to be your bank, asks for some sensitive details, claims to have fixed some made-up issue, and hangs up, leaving you clueless to the fact that they have just drained all the money from your account.</p>



<p>This technique or similar could have been used to gain access to Twitter’s systems through tricking staff into installing tools like a remote access tool (RAT) which would allow the hackers to gain access to admin tools and credentials without raising any alarms.</p>



<p>Now, this tool that the hackers had access to would allow them to edit account variables like the confirmation email address, the 2FA email address or phone number, and so on, allowing them to reset the password and gain full control over the account.</p>



<p>From there they sent out the tweets with the bitcoin scam. Each sculpted to fit the persona who tweeted them out, indicating a lot of time and thought put into this attack.</p>



<h2>something darker?</h2>



<p>I’ll leave you with something to ponder on:<br>Was money really the final motive of this attack?</p>



<p>Somebody with the ability to pull off such a sophisticated attack would surely be above a low-income bitcoin scam. <br>Personally, I think the scam is a mere cover-up for something much darker.</p>



<p>What’s your opinion? Leave a comment below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section></section><section> <article><div><p>The last fifteen years has seen a surge of interest in decentralised technology. From well-funded blockchain projects like IPFS to the emergence of large scale information networks such as Dat, Scuttlebutt and ActivityPub, this is renewed life in peer-to-peer technologies; a renaissance that enjoys widespread growth, driven by the desire for platform commons and community self-determination. These are goals that are fundamentally at odds with – and a response to – the incumbent platforms of social media, music and movie distribution and data storage. As we enter the 2020s, centralised power and decentralised communities are on the verge of outright conflict for the control of the digital public space. The resilience of centralised networks and the political organisation of their owners remains significantly underestimated by protocol activists. At the same time, the decentralised networks and the communities they serve have never been more vulnerable. The peer-to-peer community is dangerously unprepared for a crisis-fuelled future that has very suddenly arrived at their door.</p></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Good luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world. You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation.“</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“‘Torrents are down, worldwide’ said no one, ever. #centralizationisfragile“</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>How precarious are decentralised networks? Answering this requires an understanding of both the power of their political energy and history of antagonism. Conceptually, peer-to-peer technologies are not new – they are networks of digital topologies, intertwining configurations of software clients, devices, connections and protocols whose ownership is distributed. They work in concert to provide a robust alternative to centralised governance, ideally achieving data resilience without transferring the ownership of this data to a single authority. The internet itself is a decentralised network.</p></div><div><p>Often – but not always – decentralised networks emerge due to a collective desire to <label for="toggleFootnotes">rebalance societal power</label>. One of the antagonisms that brought these tensions to the boiling point was the series of legal battles over digital intellectual property rights.  This conflict – a so-called Copyright War –  had <label for="toggleFootnotes">started “offline” decades earlier</label>, but collided with digital infrastructure for the first time in 1999 with the launch of Napster. Its trajectory would last over a decade and the fallout reverberates into the present. To understand the Copyright War is to understand how close copyright reformists came to dismantling an existing centralised data ownership structure, and how they failed to appreciate the resilience of this opponent as it economically and legally exploited their peer-to-peer model. </p></div><div><p>Early file-sharing software featured simple interfaces and enormous content offerings. They arrived years before popular digital music stores, and as such Napster and its clones shook the music and movie industry into mobilising against them. These networks were tied to their client software, and by targeting their developers with litigation, were easily shut down. Copyright reformists first campaigned on behalf of Napster and similar tools, but as residential bandwidth scarcity and demand for data freedom grew, these activists saw new promise beneath the application – an opportunity embedded in the network layer. </p></div><div><p>BitTorrent’s launch in 2001 enabled file-sharing on a massive, efficient and resilient scale. By embedding the decentralised ideology beneath the desktop client, and within the protocol on which the client runs, the act of file-sharing became much more resistant to legislative attack. To many of its supporters and combatants, BitTorrent seemed unstoppable. Most of the early 2000s discourse prophesied the devastation of an existing capitalist cultural order, accelerated by significant ideological moments of the era: the establishment of the first collaborative online <label for="toggleFootnotes">music library</label>, the foundation of the Pirate Bay website, censorship-resistant document distribution, and the formation of the <label for="toggleFootnotes">Piratpartiet</label>, and its <label for="toggleFootnotes">international equivalents.</label> </p></div><div><p>The incumbent powers worked with lawmakers to draft new legislation and went after ‘leechers’ - people downloading content, but who through BitTorrent’s protocol design became unwitting <label for="toggleFootnotes">uploaders themselves</label>. Litigators discovered that by conducting surveillance on a BitTorrent tracker, they could bulk collect participating IP addresses and randomly file severe civic lawsuits, utilising harsher laws reserved for distribution. Their targets were often the economically vulnerable, including <label for="toggleFootnotes"><em>“children, grandparents, unemployed single mothers, college professors—a random selection from the millions of Americans who have used P2P networks.“</em></label> It was one piece of a broader scattershot strategy that spared no one; <label for="toggleFootnotes">infrastructure</label>, <label for="toggleFootnotes">physical media</label>, broadcast media, adjacent software projects and device manufacturers were all targeted. These tactics could manifest as copyright taxes on CD–Rs or portable media players, or in the form of legal liability, such as unsuccessful proposals for ISPs to bear responsibility for user activity. </p></div><div><p>The entertainment industry framed the conflict as a fight against movie and music “piracy.” However, this rhetoric obscures the serious implications of the tactics deployed by these giants. Central to the defeat of this particular peer-to-peer movement was that its infrastructure was vulnerable to <label for="toggleFootnotes"><em>weaponised design</em></label>, in which the network protocol directly empowers attackers through its design. For BitTorrent, this empowerment came as the protocol exposes every user’s participation in the network. This data was exploited to unmask users, ruin lives and provide justification for new legislation. The collapse of centralised power that was prophesied in the 2000s never materialised. Centralised actors outmaneuvered the reformists, shielding themselves and their own ecosystems from scrutiny. <label for="toggleFootnotes">The concentrated media companies of the 2020s now dwarf their 1999 equivalents</label>, and the innovations pioneered by decentralised infrastructure were exploited by the winners as they ascended to monopoly. </p></div><div><p>The most poetic example of peer-to-peer technologies pressed into the service of corporate giants is the story of peer-to-peer software engineer Ludvig Strigeus. Having built the popular μTorrent client and perhaps sensing the changing winds, Strigeus joined former μTorrent CEO Daniel Ek’s new startup. <label for="toggleFootnotes">Together, they built a quasi-Napster/BitTorrent hybrid that relied on a vast, unauthorised music catalog drawn from its user base</label>. Today, that architecture is long gone, but the startup – Spotify – <label for="toggleFootnotes">boasts 124 million subscribers, taking in USD$7.44 billion in revenue</label> but paying artists just USD$4.37 per 1,000 streams. </p></div><div><p>As we can see from history, blind faith in technically resilient network protocols is naïve and misplaced. The Copyright War drives home hard lessons around politics, corporate appropriation, transparency, collectivism and the urgency of network safety, all illustrated in the <label for="toggleFootnotes">decimated lives of key or adjacent reformists</label>, collateral user damage, and resulting legislation. In 2013, BitTorrent was responsible for <label for="toggleFootnotes">3.35% of all internet traffic</label>. Today the networks remain but this market share has shrunk. Torrents are down worldwide.</p></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change. When the crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.“</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><blockquote> <p><label for="toggleFootnotes">“Your objective [as a designer] should always be to eliminate instructions entirely by making everything self-explanatory, or as close to it as possible. When instructions are absolutely necessary, cut them back to a bare minimum.“</label></p></blockquote></div></div><div><p>As the Copyright War faded into the background, the iPhone paradigm – a constrained, centralised, individualised system marketed as “the individual at one with their device” – became the standard for personal computing. New and boundless design-led opportunities appeared almost overnight, powered by a bottomless injection of venture capital that fostered the accelerated growth of <label for="toggleFootnotes">platform capitalism</label>. To quote design and art historians Arden Stern and Sami Siegelbaum: </p></div><div><div><blockquote> <label for="toggleFootnotes">“Neoliberalism can be distinguished from Fordist capitalism’s mass production of consumer goods by the ways it seeks to marketize previously uncommodified sectors of human life. Indeed, one of the questions [we seek] to explore is how design might enable this process by locating new sources of extraction and accumulation by facilitating the commodification of that which was once thought to be outside the scope of the market.”</label></blockquote></div></div><div><p>Finding these new sources of extraction became a priority for centralised tech platforms. They had spent the previous decade achieving scale and resilience; now they sought to extract new value and justify their presence in daily life. Framing the mobile device as an extension of self made the emergence of the new ‘digital wellbeing’ market compelling. For example, <label for="toggleFootnotes">Safety Check</label> – a Facebook feature introduced after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami&nbsp;– encourages users in disaster-stricken areas to interact with the platform to mark themselves as safe and be connected to communication services for disaster relief. The Apple Watch – originally launched as a general-purpose wrist computer – underwent a complete rebrand as a digital health and fitness device, and <label for="toggleFootnotes">its ability to detect and call emergency services in crisis is actively marketed in emotional video testimonials</label> released by its maker. Amazon Ring and Google Nest encourage consumers to actively contribute to a growing network of community surveillance systems promising safety in exchange for ceding the household’s digital capital to a powerful, unaccountable platform.</p></div><div><p>These tech-driven efforts to respond to …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Here at Hologram, we use two main programming languages for our backend stack: PHP and Python. Our PHP component is the one that is the most visible to users since that is our entire REST API.</p><p>We do get some questions on why we use PHP in such a major role because the conventional wisdom is that PHP is outdated or clunky. My contention is that PHP suffers from this view because of two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>People learned it back in 2005 when it was a younger language and was lacking a lot of really useful or common features like classes</li><li>In order to maintain compatibility, many popular applications *cough* Wordpress *cough* didn’t take advantage of a lot of the newer stuff and people had to keep hacking on old-fashioned PHP well past the time a lot of great new features were introduced.</li></ol><p>Because of this, I want to defend PHP as a really useful language and a great fit for our needs.</p><p>I think a lot of people already know that PHP has some good built-in web server features, like a global array for getting HTTP headers or built-in session cookie support, but they may not know about a lot of other features that make it a solid language overall.</p><p>Here are some of the great pieces of PHP:</p><h2>Classes!</h2><p>Yes, back in the day PHP didn’t have classes and things could get messy very quickly. I recall long lists of include calls to pull in all the functions you’d need and having to keep passing tons of arguments around to functions with really long names.<br></p><p>Well, have no fear; PHP has great object support these days. Classes, constructors, destructors, namespaces, inheritance, and all that good stuff.<br></p><p>But it goes beyond that into what is a great feature that is more unique to PHP:<br></p><h2>The Autoloader</h2><p>PHP has a useful feature where it can automatically load the file for a class if the class hasn’t been loaded already. This means no more blocks of include/require statements at the top of all your files. If you use a class then it gets loaded.<br></p><p>On its own, this is already really nice, but what makes this a game changer is that the specific autoloading logic can be totally customized in your application and multiple autoloaders can be chained together. This means that all of your third party libraries get autoloaded as well.</p><p>In your code, you just create your classes or call their methods and everything gets pulled in for you. No need to include anything manually or fight with include paths like in other languages. In the entire Hologram codebase outside of test code, we call <em>include()</em> or <em>require()</em> maybe twice.<br></p><p>But speaking of those third party libraries…<br></p><h2>Package Management</h2><p>PHP has package management systems to rival those of other languages. The one we use at Hologram is called Composer, which is the most popular one. It’s incredibly simple to use and stores all settings in JSON files. You can give it version ranges to use for each package and it’ll generate a lockfile that could be checked into the repo if you want to be extra careful about making sure everyone is using the exact same package revision.</p><p>To add a new package into the JSON file and install it, it’s as simple as</p><p><code>
    composer install somepackage
</code></p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>PHP has a great developer community around it these days and so not only are there a ton of individual libraries to use, but full frameworks that can help make building an app much easier. At Hologram, we use the Slim Framework which has a very simple router for defining our API calls as well as other useful features, like an easy method for adding middleware which comes in handy for authentication and rate limiting code.<br></p><p>Other popular frameworks include Laravel and Symfony.</p><h2>PDO</h2><p>PHP has the best database integration of any language I’ve used and PDO is the cornerstone of that. PDO stands for PHP Database Objects and it is the preferred way to execute your SQL queries.<br></p><p>It includes all the usual functions for running queries and paging through the results. Rows can be returned as PHP associative arrays which means that all columns are properly labelled in the array itself.<br></p><p>The best part is that it supports parameterized queries and automatically sanitizes the inputs for you. This means that you can do something like this:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?;");
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute([$idnumber]);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>PDO will automatically replace that “?” with the value in <em>$idnumber</em> and it will properly escape things to prevent SQL injection attacks for you.</p><p>You can also do cool things like named parameters:</p><p><code>
    // define $database as a PDO object
    $values = ['id' =&gt; 10, 'email' =&gt; 'someemail@hologram.io'];
    $stmt = $database-&gt;prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id AND email = :email;');
    $result = $stmt-&gt;execute($values);
    $rows = $result-&gt;fetchAll();
</code></p><p>In this case, PDO will replace the parameters properly from that array while still sanitizing them.<br></p><p>PDO also exposes all the same interfaces regardless of the underlying database engine. There are of course the occasional SQL differences between engines, but most of the time you simply specify the type of database when you initially connect and then make all the same function calls you would for anything else.<br></p><h2>Phinx</h2><p>Speaking of databases, I want to mention a fantastic third party library we use called Phinx to do all of our database migrations. Anytime we need to make a schema change, we define it entirely using PHP code that Phinx then runs on the database. Migrations look like this:<br></p><p><code>
    $orders = $this-&gt;table('orders');
    $orders-&gt;addColumn('invoice_text', 'string', ['length'=&gt;256, 'default'=&gt;''])
           -&gt;update();
</code></p><p>Check them out at <a href="https://phinx.org/" target="_blank">phinx.org</a></p><h2>Lots of useful built-in functions</h2><p>One final aspect that makes things easier and faster in PHP is all of the great built-in utility functions.<br></p><p>Let’s say you have a result set from a database which would be an array of row arrays. You want to pull the name column from each one. You could of course do this with a map function, which PHP supports as well, but why not do this the easy way:</p><p><code>
$names = array_column($rows, 'name');
</code></p><p>‍<em>‍</em>That’s it. And it’s very fast, as that would all be running in PHP’s C internals.<br></p><p>There are dozens more like that, for everything from doing more array operations to parsing XML to manipulating uploaded files and PHP has great documentation on all of them.<br></p><p>A few useful ones that we like:</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk" target="_blank"><strong>array_chunk</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Break an array into smaller chunks of any size</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php" target="_blank"><strong>array_unique</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Remove all duplicate values from an array</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime" target="_blank"><strong>DateTime</strong></a> - A whole class for handling dates that can also parse plain English date descriptions like “midnight first day of next month”</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fpassthru" target="_blank"><strong>fpassthru</strong></a> - Reads a file and sends it right back out to the user</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-getcsv" target="_blank"><strong>str_getcsv</strong></a> - Part of built-in CSV parsing, this reads a CSV row from a string</p><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode" target="_blank"><strong>urlencode</strong></a> - URL encode a string</p><p>And don’t forget useful operators like <em>??</em> which allows you to check for index existence in an array while specifying a default value. </p><p><code>
$a = $some_array[$x] ?? 500;
</code></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><div><p>Consider PHP for your projects! It’s better than you think.</p></div><h3>Further Reading</h3><p>Modern PHP by Josh Lockhart (The author of the Slim Framework)</p><p><a href="https://phptherightway.com/">phptherightway.com</a> (Also by Josh Lockhart and Phil Sturgeon)</p></div></div></div>]]>

        Using custom code, the natural curvature of each tree is "corrected." Manufactured objects, i.e. buildings and power lines, twist and contort around the artificially plumbed tree. Each photo is shot on large format film, the only medium that captures enough detail to straighten the tree without pixelly artifacts. Presented as silver gelatin prints.

                <div>
                    <p>Tesla may well be the biggest driver of China’s journey towards technological self-reliance, as the “Tech Cold War” between the U.S. and China deepens. This observation wasn’t obvious to me until I listened (three times) to Elon Musk’s Q&amp;A session at the 2020 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai earlier this month.</p><p>【想看<a href="https://interconnected.blog/tesla-china-the-tech-cold-war/#chinese-version-below">中文的读者请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>While most of the media coverage focused on<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/09/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-very-close-to-level-5-autonomous-driving/"> Musk’s bold proclamation</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/07/09/elon-musk-tesla-will-have-level-5-self-driving-cars-this-year/#1cd954a32d1d"> that Tesla is</a><a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy"> very close to achieving</a> Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities, <strong>the entirety of what he said</strong> during the Q&amp;A has far-reaching implications, technologically and geopolitically.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mwe2ABPkZLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="local-hire-original-engineering-open-patents">Local Hire, Original Engineering, Open Patents</h2><p>Musk’s Q&amp;A was, first and foremost, an aggressive recruiting pitch for the engineering team that Tesla is building in China. What’s most noteworthy is his emphasis that the Tesla China team will be doing “original engineering”.</p><p>This emphasis is important for three reasons:</p><p><strong>1. Local optimization:</strong> for self-driving to work well, where your engineers are physically located play a surprisingly important role. Musk shared that Tesla’s Autopilot works best in California, because the company’s engineers are mostly in California, thus they can do local optimization most effectively to adapt to the reality in California. The plan is: once self-driving works well in California, the software can be adapted to other locations with varying degrees of further local optimization.</p><p>In order for Tesla's Autopilot to work well in China, it needs a local engineering team capable of what its team is doing in California. Thus, “original engineering” makes perfect product sense if Tesla wants to deliver self-driving cars in China -- a growing electric vehicle market where Tesla is taking a large chunk, according to research by ARK Investment. Beyond the engineering and product rationale, it is also <strong>a killer recruiting pitch for the best and brightest</strong>; no talented engineer wants to spend the day refactoring and adapting someone else’s code.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla-china-market-share-1.png 854w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>2. Friendlier regulators:</strong> In his Q&amp;A, Musk’s confidence in achieving L5 is tempered by the reality that neither he nor anyone else knows what is the level of safety that must be achieved to convince regulators. Twice as safe as a human driver? 10-times? 100-times? Or in Musk’s words, how many 9’s after 99% is needed? We don’t know.</p><p>Regulators play a decisive role in the pace of self-driving advancement, more so than most other tech sectors. For a regulator to make a judgment on the safety threshold, it’s a combination of hard evidence and political will plus incentives. Assuming we have the same safety evidence, then the Chinese government currently has more appetite to experiment with and invest in AI than the U.S. government. <strong>Thus, Chinese regulators of all levels are more incentivized to say “yes” to things, while their American counterparts are more incentivized to say “no”.</strong> This political will was on full display at this AI conference, where the Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qiang">Li Qiang</a>, more or less presided over the entire keynote session, where almost every speaker ritualistically praised his leadership at the beginning of each talk. Li’s presence is a big deal, as Shanghai tries to lead China’s AI future, having lost out on the other tech trend booms to Beijing, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. Tesla’s China GigaFactory is already located in Shanghai. It’s likely that Tesla will continue to receive more favorable regulatory treatment in Shanghai than in California or anywhere else in the U.S.</p><p><strong>3. Reduced risk of sanctions:</strong> With “original engineering”, Tesla China creates original IP that will not be subjected to future U.S. sanctions. Thus, this approach is effective for recruiting and important for Tesla’s own long-term development. China, in turn, will rightfully have access to the IP generated from Tesla China.</p><p>But what’s more important is that Tesla doesn’t care about patents anyways. In 2014, it decided to open source its entire patent portfolio related to building an electric vehicle. In Musk’s mind, patent protection is an impediment not accelerant to technological advancement. In <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">his blog post</a> announcing the no-patent decision, he wrote:</p><blockquote><em>“<strong>Technology leadership is not defined by patents</strong>, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the <strong>ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers</strong>. We believe that</em><a href="https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge"><em> applying the open source philosophy to our patents</em></a><em> will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard.” [Bold emphasis mine]</em></blockquote><p>Tesla is flexing its muscle to attract and motivate the most talented engineers in China. When they do develop the self-driving technology needed for Tesla (and yes, I believe it is a “when” not “if”), chances are all that technology will be open sourced for anyone in China and the world to do the same. <strong>Open source technology</strong>, as the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/understanding-us-export-controls-with-open-source-projects/">clarified in its whitepaper earlier this month</a>, is <strong>not subjected </strong>to the U.S. government’s various export control restrictions.</p><p>Of course, achieving self-driving is not just an algorithm and software engineering challenge, but also a hardware one. To understand that piece of the puzzle, let’s look at Tesla’s custom-designed Full Self-Driving (FSD) chip in the context of China’s current chip manufacturing capabilities.</p><h2 id="what-is-fsd">What is FSD?</h2><p>Tesla began developing its own <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">FSD chip</a> in 2016. In 2019, it began volume production and deployed these FSD chips inside Model X, S, and 3. It is an 8-bit chip (not the more powerful 32-bit or 64-bit general purpose chip), in order to satisfy the specific computation needs of a self-driving car but nothing more. Thus far, Samsung manufactures the chips using its 14nm process at its Austin, Texas foundry. A self-driving chip does not have as high a requirement in terms of form factor (or size) as a smartphone or smaller device, thus the 14nm process is sufficient.</p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/07/tesla_fsd_computer_board-small.jpg 745w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Tesla FSD board.

It’s how you do matrix multiplications -- an operation that a neural network needs to do many many times, especially for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network</a>. In order for a self-driving car to “see” what’s going on while driving, it has to do a lot of dot products to compute all the image data gathered from its surrounding, frame by frame, before deciding what to do, if anything. And the car must be able to do this constantly for a long time without overheating or slowing down performance. The FSD’s performance apparently exceeds an Nvidia alternative’s by 21-times, while consuming much less power.</p><p>Each Tesla car is installed with two of these chips to add redundancy and improve decision-making: if the two chips “disagree”, the decision is thrown out and the computer starts a new compute and inference cycle on new data. <strong>Essentially, each Tesla has two “brains” to keep each other honest.</strong></p><h2 id="can-china-make-fsd">Can China Make FSD?</h2><p>As I’ve described in a previous deep dive post, <strong>“</strong><a href="https://interconnected.blog/riscv-china-nightingales/"><strong>RISC-V, China, Nightingales</strong></a><strong>”, </strong>China’s largest chip foundry SMIC does have 14nm capabilities. In fact, SMIC’s co-CEO Liang Mong-song, who is credited with bringing the 14nm capabilities to the foundry, was a TSMC veteran and also instrumental in helping Samsung first achieve its own 14nm process, which is being used to manufacture the FSD chips right now. These chips are <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/tesla_(car_company)/fsd_chip#SoC">designed based on the ARMv8.0-A</a> instruction set architecture (ISA), which isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions since ARM is a UK company.</p><p>That being said, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/huawei-uk-5g.html">UK recently banned Huawei completely</a>, reversing its earlier decision that allowed Huawei to build the “non-core” portions of its 5G network. This decision may signal a stronger willingness by UK regulators to either push out Chinese companies or prevent technologies from going to China, as it moves closer to the U.S. in this Tech Cold War.</p><p>To further muddle the picture, Softbank <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-explores-options-for-chip-designer-arm-holdings-11594672437">who owns ARM is mulling a sale</a> after buying it for $32 billion USD four years ago. Meanwhile, RISC-V, the open source ISA, is not yet mature enough to design a self-driving optimized chip like the FSD</p><p>Needless to say, there are many moving pieces to keep track of. SMIC is facing many challenges as it grows into a world-class chip foundry. It has had trouble acquiring advanced lithography technology from the Dutch company ASML, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-usa-china-insight/trump-administration-pressed-dutch-hard-to-cancel-china-chip-equipment-sale-sources-idUSKBN1Z50HN">due to pressure from the Trump administration</a>. Without ASML’s technology, SMIC will have a hard time advancing beyond the 14nm process to 7nm or denser processes. It will also have trouble acquiring other EDA tools to scale its production capacity, because the<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7phT1v0G45m87JU6s7W5bA"> dominant suppliers are mostly American</a>. Depending on who you ask, SMIC’s future is still pretty bleak, even with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/smic-chinas-biggest-chipmaker-surges-in-shanghai-listing.html">its successful IPO</a> on the Shanghai STAR market.</p><p>But at the end of the day, Tesla needs 14nm capabilities and SMIC has them. In fact, <strong>it would make sense for Tesla to be a customer of China-made chips for its China-made cars</strong>. This arrangement will help Tesla avoid future restrictions if U.S. sanctions widen to include its current chip production in Austin. Producing FSD chips at scale for a high-caliber customer like Tesla will push SMIC to up its game on manufacturing quality and operational efficiencies. Combined with the software advancement in AI from the local engineering team, Tesla can end up giving China’s technology ecosystem quite a boost.</p><h2 id="ambition-and-pragmatism">Ambition and Pragmatism</h2><p>Tesla is not only an ambitious company, it’s also a pragmatic one. <strong>Ambitious pragmatism</strong> is what a company, and I’d argue a country, needs to both survive and thrive.

      <div>
        <div>

  

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

Q: What are Darius's abilities in League of Legends?
A: Darius's abilities in League of Legends are: Apprehend, Decimate,
Noxian Guillotine, Crippling Strike, Apprehend, and Hemorrhage.

Q: Who did Capablanca defeat to become world chess champion?
A: Capablanca defeated Lasker to become world chess champion.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,
what is in the box?
A: Two pencils.

Q: Then if …</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>There is no information or page for him on Facebook and or Twitter. However, Tyrese Devon Haspil, has been the personal assistant of Fahim for more than four years, according to people who were close to Fahim.</p>
<p>It is not clear if he deliberately deleted all personal information about him on social media before committing the alleged crime.</p>
<p>The personal assistant, Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, was expected to be charged in a criminal complaint with second degree murder and other crimes.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the motive for the killing stemmed from Mr. Saleh having discovered that the assistant had stolen tens of thousands of dollars from him, despite the fact that Mr. Saleh had not reported the man and had set up what amounted to a repayment plan for him to return the money, one of the officials said.</p>
<p>The police were expected to announce the arrest at a news conference later Friday.</p>
<p>Investigators have also concluded that Mr. Saleh was killed on Monday, the day before his body was found, and that the killer returned the next day to Mr. Salehâ€™s apartment on East Houston Street to dismember the body and clean up the crime scene.</p>
<p>Detectives believe that the killer, dressed in a black three-piece suit, white shirt and tie, wearing a black mask and carrying a duffle bag, followed Mr. Saleh off an elevator in his building and into his apartment, a law enforcement official said. He used a Taser to immobilize Mr. Saleh and then stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>Security video taken from inside the elevator shows the killer later using a battery-operated portable vacuum cleaner in an apparent effort to remove any traces of his presence, the official said.</p>
<p>New York Cityâ€™s medical examiner announced on Thursday that Mr. Saleh had died from multiple stab wounds to his neck and torso. Initially, a law enforcement official had described the killing as a â€œhitâ€� and said it looked â€œlike a professional job.â€�</p>
<p>Detectives investigating the murder believe the killerâ€™s work dismembering the body was interrupted when Mr. Salehâ€™s sister buzzed from the buildingâ€™s lobby, another official said, prompting him to flee through the apartmentâ€™s back door and into a stairwell before the sister arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Salehâ€™s family said in a statement on Wednesday that the gruesome killing was so shocking it was unfathomable.</p>
<p>â€œFahim is more than what you are reading,â€� the family said. â€œHe is so much more. His brilliant and innovative mind took everyone who was a part of his world on a journey and he made sure never to leave anyone behind.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents who eventually settled near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a small city on the Hudson River.</p>
<p>After graduating from Bentley University in Waltham, Mass., in 2009, he built an app called PrankDial that allowed users to send prerecorded prank calls. Mr. Saleh said he eventually built PrankDial into a $10 million business.</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh went on to found Pathao, a motorcycle ride-sharing start-up in Bangladesh. He left that company in 2018 to begin a similar venture in Nigeria, an app known as Gokada.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Mr. Saleh was the chief executive of Gokada and oversaw a shift in its business during a turbulent time. In February, Nigerian officials began enforcing a ban on motorcycle taxis in major commercial and residential parts of the countryâ€™s largest city, Lagos.</p>
<p>Gokada was forced to halt its ride-hailing business and laid workers off, but Mr. Saleh pivoted the company to focus on food and parcel delivery and business logistics.</p>
<p>â€œFahimâ€™s passion for Nigeria and its youth was immeasurable,â€� Gokada said in a statement. â€œHe believed young Nigerians were extremely bright and talented individuals who would flourish if just given the right opportunity.â€�</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was also the founding partner in a Manhattan-based venture capital fund, Adventure Capital, that invested in similar transit start-ups in Colombia and Bangladesh.</p>

      <p>I had a very cool surprise today while checking my GitHub profile. Some projects I contributed to have been selected to included to be part of the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">Arctic Code Vault</a> project, and I am officially an <strong>Arctic Code Vault Contributor</strong>!</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"><img alt="" src="https://sam.elborai.me/images/a/n/n/o/t/annotation-2020-07-17-162632-7375779b.jpeg"></a></p>
<p>That made me chuckle, and I now have a nice little badge under my contact info. </p>
<p>Though to be honest my contributions are really just simple corrections and fixes that I regularly do to projects I'm using or reading about. Not the majestic legacy some people would imagine when they hear of a project like this one! </p>
<p>But hey, people in 10k years will be able to blame me for a specific typo I made, isn't that great? 😁 (if they can figure out how to use git, which isn't something I would bet on).</p>

<p>This is a journey of obscure settings, red herrings, and poll vs. epoll. A story of how I had spent a couple days performance profiling and optimizing some Elixir code, only to discover that the true solution to the performance issues was an obscure setting in the Erlang VM that controlled which system call the IO polling subsystem used, and that my code-level optimizations were irrelevant. This particular setting has been made redundant by a rewrite of IO polling in a subsequent Erlang/OTP release, but still, it was a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, we <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/why-is-everyone-talking-about-mqtt/">released our MQTT protocol adapter</a>. Like our <a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/being-protocol-agnostic-at-ably">Pusher and Pubnub adapters</a>, it was implemented as an Elixir service, which sits in front of our normal service frontend and live-translates to and from Ably's own protocol.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the release, we decided to do some load testing to figure out the CPU cost per instance of holding onto substantial numbers of mostly-idle MQTT connections (driven by a customer with a large number of IoT devices).</p>
<p>Initial results were not great.</p>
<p>With 15K idle MQTT connections, on one of our usual instances (an AWS m5.large), CPU usage was reaching 60%, mostly from the adapter (with the remainder from the normal Ably frontend process). So we started trying to figure out why that was.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of ways you can get performance data out of the BEAM (the Erlang VM). To start with there's the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/debugging.html#observer">observer</a>, which you can use to view all running processes (<a href="https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html">Erlang processes</a>, not system processes), ordered by reductions (≈function calls, a proxy for CPU usage) or by memory usage. There are also various tracing facilities, which can trace all calls from particular processes, all calls to a given function from any process, and so on. (The built-in tools can be a little low-level, but there are various more user-friendly wrappers available).</p>
<p>I couldn't see anything obvious from just looking at the observer; no processes appeared to be using an excess of resources. What I really wanted was to trace the whole system, with all function calls, and then generate flame graphs out of that data, to get a sense of what was actually using up all that CPU. Doing that using traditional BEAM tracing of every function call would be very expensive; tracing adds too much overhead to do it for every function call ever. Luckily, Scott Fritchie has a great project called eflame2 <a href="https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame">https://github.com/slfritchie/eflame</a> (building off Vlad Ki's eflame <a href="https://github.com/proger/eflame">https://github.com/proger/eflame</a>), which makes some experimental changes to the BEAM to allow it to support time-sampled trace data: generating a stack trace every (say) 100ms, and using that to construct a flame graph.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/07/example-flamegraph.png"><figcaption>Example section of a flamegraph. The original is SVG, and you can click segments to zoom in on them. This is just a screenshot.</figcaption></figure><p>The results were a little puzzling. It showed the vast majority of time per the flamegraphs spent in SLEEP, even though observed CPU usage was still very high.</p>
<p>Experienced BEAMers may now be thinking "A-ha! I bet this is an sbwt issue!" The BEAM process scheduler by default, when it runs out of Erlang processes to schedule, spins for several milliseconds to stop the OS scheduler from scheduling a different OS process, to reduce latency if new work does need to be done. This is known as <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">scheduler busy wait</a>. This can be reasonable behavior if the BEAM is the only important process running on the box that it's running on — which is often the case. But in our case it isn't, it has to play nicely with our frontend processes, and others as well. This behavior often catches out people who try to benchmark Erlang/Elixir against other languages, making the BEAM appear to consume a lot of CPU, even when average latency is low. (I'm pretty sure this mistake is what led to the conclusion that "Elixir nearly saturated all 36 cores while delivering a surprisingly consistent performance" in <a href="https://stressgrid.com/blog/benchmarking_go_vs_node_vs_elixir/">this blog post by Stressgrid</a>, for example). It can easily be disabled by passing <code>+sbwt none</code> ('t' = threshold) to the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This was not the cause of my problem; I had already made that change.</p>
<p>So I shrugged, put aside for now the SLEEPs as a measurement artifact, and filtered them out of the trace output, generating some flamegraphs to see what the biggest consumers of CPU were out of all the non-idle samples.</p>
<p>One source was <code>:crypto.strong_random_bytes</code> when responding to websocket pings from our Ably frontends. The adapter connects to our frontends the same way our client libraries do: over websockets, one for each connection. </p>
<p>(Using websockets to connect two services running on the same box may seem an odd choice: the reasoning was that the translated connection would just appear and behave as a normal external websocket, the Ably frontend wouldn't have to do anything special or different for a connection via the MQTT adapter compared to a normal external websocket connection.) </p>
<p>The frontend sends a websocket ping to each client every 15 seconds, primarily as a way of detecting (and allowing the client to detect) whether the connection is genuinely still alive. When sending a message (even just a pong), a websocket feature called <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.3">masking</a> requires the client to generate a random "mask" — random bytes which are XOR'd with the payload. The point of this is to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-10.3">defeat cache poisoning attacks on proxies</a>. This is of course unnecessary for a websocket between two services running on the same instance. I disabled masking (using <a href="https://github.com/meh/elixir-socket">elixir-socket</a> this was as simple as passing <code>mask: nil</code> as an option to <code>Socket.Web.send</code>).</p>
<p>Another source of CPU usage was responding to MQTT pings from clients. The current code was responding to them in the same way it responded to all messages: decoding them into a <a href="https://github.com/suvash/hulaaki/">Hulaaki</a> Message , passing that to a main <code>MQTT.FromClient.handle()</code> function that pattern-matches on the message and sends a ping response:</p>
<pre><code>def handle(%Hulaaki.Message.PingReq{}, state) do
  Handler.send_to_client(Message.ping_response(), state)
  {:noreply, state}
end</code></pre>
<p>Not much, but do it a couple times a minute for tens of thousands of connections and it all adds up. Optimizing this was just a matter of adding a special-case to the ranch handler to recognise a ping and respond with a pong before the normal MQTT message-parsing logic is invoked. With Elixir's binary pattern matching this is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>@ping &lt;&lt;192,0&gt;&gt;
@pong &lt;&lt;208,0&gt;&gt;

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, @ping}, state) do
  @transport.send(socket, @pong)
  {:noreply, %{state | last_activity: now()}}
end

def handle_info({:tcp, socket, data}, state) do
  // handle all other packets</code></pre>
<p>(For most messages we have to handle messages spread over multiple TCP packets; for a two-byte message this is not an issue.)</p>
<p>I kept going, looking at the other (smaller but still prominent) CPU users from the flamegraphs. <code>URI.encode_query</code> was spending a fair amount of time in <code>URI.encode_www_form</code>; I replaced it with a custom query string encoder that didn't bother with that, since I knew I was already passing URI-safe strings. <code>Timex.Time.now()</code> / <code>elapsed()</code> (used to keep track of the last activity time on a connection) was showing quite a bit; I replaced it with <code>:erlang.system_time(:seconds)</code>. And so on.</p>
<p>And after all these in retrospect somewhat desperate micro-optimizations, &nbsp;I was... well, capturing flamegraphs that were now even more SLEEP dominated — having filed down everything else to the bare minimum —but system CPU was still much, much higher than it should have been.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Then, at some point I stumbled across <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2011-April/057472.html">a mailing list thread from 2011</a> about the <code>+K</code> flag (an argument to erlang runtime, like <code>+sbwt</code>). The <a href="http://www1.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html">reference manual</a> states that it "Enables or disables the kernel poll functionality if the emulator supports it. Default is false (disabled)."</p>
<p>It turns out that with this disabled, the BEAM uses the <code>poll</code> system call to check for incoming IO events on Linux; with it enabled, it uses <code>epoll</code>. Julia Evans has a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/03/async-io-on-linux--select--poll--and-epoll/">great blog post on the difference between those</a>; the short version is that for listening to events on a large numbers of mostly-idle sockets, <code>epoll</code> is <em>dramatically</em> more efficient.</p>
<p>Enabling <code>+K true</code> was the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/magic-story.html">magic switch</a> I'd been looking for. With it on, BEAM CPU usage in the idle-MQTT load test dropped by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>So all the within-BEAM profiling and tracing, all my careful optimization of MQTT ping responses and so on were completely irrelevant, all a red herring. The BEAM was spending almost all of its CPU cycles on IO polling, only a tiny fraction actually executing bytecode, and I'd been spending all my time optimizing that small fraction.</p>
<p>One might question why that wasn't the default. There apparently exist usecases where <code>poll</code> may have an edge over <code>epoll</code> (extremely active sockets), but the general advice seems to be that the vast majority of people should use <code>epoll</code>. One person in that mailing list thread suggests that it's not the default because some OSes such as Windows don't have kernel poll support, but this doesn't make all that much sense — there's no reason to cripple platforms that do have epoll/kqueue/etc. for consistency with one that doesn't. (Especially since I doubt there are many people running the BEAM on Windows servers).</p>
<p>Happily, it seems that the Erlang/OTP team had been thinking along similar lines, and coincidentally, shortly after I discovered this, they announced that in OTP 21, the IO polling implementation <a href="http://blog.erlang.org/IO-Polling/">was being completely rewritten</a>. IO polling would be moved from scheduler threads to dedicated IO threads, and kernel-space polling (using epoll on Linux) would become the default (and in fact the <code>+K</code> switch would be removed entirely; epoll would be used always unless disabled at compile-time). Erlang/OTP 21 was duly released in June 2018, and this particular issue was solved at the source for everyone.</p>
<p>This was all two years ago. I left my micro-optimizations in: while marginal they did make some difference. I haven't had the chance to work on the adapter much recently; the problem with building services in …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The uneasy Web 2.0 truce between social networks, legacy media, and brands is falling apart. Once it was held together by ad tech. But advertising spends keep going up, brand content is at peak saturation, and audiences are slowly but surely evacuating the big social media companies. Can the three forces —&nbsp;social media, content, and commerce&nbsp;—&nbsp;find a new way relate to each other?</p>

<p>Here enters the question of community.</p>

<p>As high quality content and effective brand strategy move down the long tail, “community” has become an important concept for every post-Web 2.0 player. Crypto token holders, influencer fanbases, DTC brand customers, creator audiences, and new social networks are all often referred to as communities, and each has a stake in developing community for itself.</p>

<p>A new business type here is the paid community: a direct subscription to join in. Today, most paid communities live on the outskirts of existing social platforms. But as they become normalized, paid communities are becoming a viable business model for smaller-scale social networks aiming to be both profitable and socially sustainable.</p>

<p>This emerging new media <em>thing</em>, the paid community social network, has new rules and new risks, and just as it will require new skillsets to operate, requires a new way of understanding what both business and community mean.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-paid-communities">The Emergence of Paid Communities</h2>

<p>In the last 5 years we’ve seen several interesting innovations as Web 2.0 business models recombined into new mixtures of content, social media, and commerce. Let’s take a look at each of these.</p>

<p>Content and commerce have been merging to create new publishing endeavors that make no distinction between advertising and editorial. These businesses take multiple forms: they include expensive brand-led lifestyle marketing initiatives like the WeTransfer blog and Casper’s Woolly Magazine; “native advertising” efforts like Vox’s <a href="http://theexplainerstudio.com/">Explainer Studio</a>, NYT’s&nbsp;affiliate marketing play with the Wirecutter acquisition; and the extension of lifestyle magazines into product, such as 032c’s streetwear line.</p>

<p>Content and social are also unifying, with Twitch streaming and YouTube being the biggest video players. Meanwhile paid newsletters have taken off in a big way in the last two years. In content + community, an audience connects around a specific content producer through some platform.</p>

<p>Finally, commerce and social are coming together, although to much less a degree than marketing teams who talk up “brand communities” would like you to think. In all but a few cases, “community” here is just the marketing language used to describe a microbrand’s niche Instagram fandom. To me “community” implies users regularly engaging with <em>each other</em>, a criterion which indicates that the “regular crowd” at neighborhood joints or local skate shops are much truer communities than most online brands. Nevertheless, brands are now much better at directly engaging current and future customers through social media. This merger is clearly happening.</p>

<p>Each pairing of verticals has produced some of the most interesting companies and media projects of the last few years. But what’s happening now is that all three are coming together in a new way, fusing to form a completely different type of business: <strong>paid communities.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="paid communities emerge from the combinatation of content, social media, and commerce businessess" src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/paidcommunities.png"></p>

<p>Paid communities are a still-nascent category, but the business model is familiar: free content with a subscription paywall for more (the standard model of content + social). Paid communities develop this formula further: they take the subject matter of a content producer or brand lifestyle, and pair it with a paywalled digital social space for ongoing user interaction. Here the community is not a passive audience, but one that generates its own discussion, and for users comprises much of the value in and of itself. This community often comes to re-shape the brand or content development process.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of burgeoning paid communities you might have already heard of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stratechery: paid content + members-only forum, for investors and tech strategists.</li>
  <li>Venkatesh Rao’s Art of Gig / Yak Collective: paid content + a Discord channel, for indie consultants.</li>
  <li>New Models: content aggregator + commissioned content + paid Discord channel (conducted through Patreon), for artists and cultural producers.</li>
  <li>It’s also worth mentioning that Substack is currently layering on commenting + social features for paid newsletters, so many successful Substacks qualify.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new paid communities largely live on invite-only Telegrams, Slacks, Discords, and Facebook groups, raising the question: could there be applications more suitable to these networks? Indeed, the growing popularity of paid communities has been noticed by a bunch of new venture-funded companies such as such as <a href="http://genevachat.com/">Genevachat</a>, <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/">Mighty Networks</a>, and <a href="https://circle.so/">Circle</a>, all of which want to become “the platform for communities.”</p>

<p>Ironically, these “community platforms” are themselves largely clones of Slack and Discord. They have been designed to fit what <em>already</em> exists on the market —&nbsp;to generically scale to support every possible group&nbsp;—&nbsp;in order to drive the user numbers that can support venture-scale returns. With heavy competition and no differentiation, how could any one of these new platforms become successful? This paradox reveals the limits of venture capital logic. An alternative market analysis is needed to understand this emerging space.</p>

<p><img src="https://subpixel.space/uploads/communityplatforms.png" alt="generic looking community platforms"></p>

<p>Patreon is a good example of why generic community platforms are not the future. You could certainly say that Patreon is already at the center of content, social, and commerce. But of course, Patreon has for years been getting unbundled into A, B, and C type businesses. The reason for Patreon’s erosion is that its product design is totally unsuitable for all three use cases: it’s a bad brand platform, a bad content platform, and a bad social platform. Patreon is a classic case of what Venkatesh Rao calls “<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/too-big-to-nail">Too Big to Nail</a>,” and businesses that try to follow in its stead will face similar challenges.</p>

<p>Don’t buy into the VC hype on this one. There will not be one tool to serve new internet-first communities.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, dozens of alternative social networks have sprouted up in the last couple years. With the maturation of Javascript-based web development and plenty of front-end talent, it’s become easy to build complex web applications with tiny teams. <a href="https://futureland.tv/">futureland.tv</a>, <a href="https://dialup.com/">Dialup</a>, <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish,</a> and alternative dating app <a href="https://www.bighead.app/">Bighead</a> are among these new experiments. These alternative social networks are interesting in part because they prove that dissatisfaction with mainstream web has motivated significant movement to alternatives. But they are also interesting because of their unique user communities.</p>

<p>New social networks have typically struggled to monetize due to their small audience sizes, as they are unable to achieve the scale to make meaningful revenue from advertising. Paid communities, however, supply an engaged and paying audience, providing an alternative route to sustainability for independent social networks. At the same time, social networks solve some of the deficiencies of paid content and brand communities. This is worth understanding well.</p>

<p>Businesses want to be active participants in their customers’ social landscape, because <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel/the-hyperfragmentation-of-retail-and-why-the-biggest-winners-are-digital-ad-platforms-not-5d55b26e96c">brand values are the last battleground for differentiation</a>. This is the very justification for community marketing, and the driving force behind the evolution of brand social media accounts from joke memes to increasingly woke and personal human voices. Offering a dedicated social space is a further extension of social participation. By providing a social space, brands can try to deepen their connection with users and have a place for content they produce to be discussed.</p>

<p>Similarly, the topic-specific functionality entertainers build into their streams can be seen as prototypes for rich social spaces. In journalistic media, content providers with growing audiences also need tools to manage their audience and moderate discussion. Slack’s 10,000 message limit for free accounts is a major obstruction to doing knowledge work in these spaces, and Discord’s free tier has lamentably small file upload size limits.</p>

<p>At this point, you may wonder: “why don’t users just want one place to manage all their communities?” Today’s existing tools will continue to be sufficient for some communities, and Discord and Slack’s robust bot APIs are capable of solving <em>some</em> community needs. But fundamentally, they are still based on chat, and chat simply isn’t the right core user experience for many other communities. Unique functionality and bespoke interfaces provide distinct advantages that off-the-shelf tooling can never achieve.</p>

<p>In order to understand how diverse and specialized these paid community / social networks can be, a few case studies, drawing from different scales, will be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Replit</strong><br>Replit is a community of young programmers, supported by a forum, a real-time collaborative IDE, and a library of openly forkable code projects. The deep integration between Replit’s social space and its programmer tooling enable efficient knowledge workflows and sharing of user-generated content. At the same time, it facilitates the growth of a highly collaborative culture <em>specific to this set of tools</em>. Replit has gone the venture capital route, monetizes through a premium offering including paid cloud storage and unlimited private projects.</p>

<div><p><strong>Are.na</strong><br>Are.na, founded in 2012, can claim to be one of the most successful indie social networks. (Disclosure: I am a shareholder through its Republic crowdfund.) Originally bootstrapped by a small community of NYC-based artists, it has grown to over <a href="https://www.are.na/roadmap">12,000 monthly active users</a>, largely designers, artists, researchers, and educators. For these users the restrained interface, absence of an algorithmic feed, and community of intellectuals and cultural producers have made it a popular tool. As of May 2020, Are.na took in a respectable $20,000 monthly …</p></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post will explain how you can easily create <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Lua/Dissectors">protocol dissectors</a>
in Wireshark, using the Lua programming language. This is can be useful when you’re working with
a custom protocol that Wireshark doesn’t already have a dissector for. If Wireshark looks like
this for example</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/before.png" alt="Wireshark without dissector"></p>

<p>it’s hard to tell what the various bytes in the data part represents.</p>

<p>Wireshark is written in C, and dissectors for Wireshark are generally also written in C. However,
Wireshark has a Lua implementation that makes it easy for people who are unfamiliar with C to write
dissectors. For those who are unfamiliar with Lua, it’s a very light-weight programming language
that is designed to be implemented as a scripting language in applications to extend their
functionality.</p>

<p>The downside of using Lua is that the dissector will be slower than a dissector written in C.</p>

<p>Before we start writing the dissector, let’s go through a crash course on Lua. It’s not important
to know the language in detail, but we must know the basics.</p>

<h3 id="lua-crash-course">Lua crash course</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Lua is multi-paradigm, and supports procedural style, functional programming to some degree, and
it also has some object-oriented programming features. It doesn’t have classes, prototypes or
inheritance out of the box, but they can be made by the programmer.</li>
  <li>It’s dynamically typed.</li>
  <li>Scope is either <code>local</code> or <code>global</code>. It’s global if you don’t declare it.</li>
  <li>Semicolons are not needed. Whitespace is not important like in Python.</li>
  <li>Lines that start with <code>--</code> are comments.</li>
  <li>Don’t use <code>++</code> or <code>+=</code>. Use <code>i = i + 1</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Not equal in conditionals is <code>~=</code> rather than <code>!=</code>.</li>
  <li>Its types are: string, number, boolean, nil, function, userdata, thread and table. Number
represents all numbers, both floating points and integers. Booleans are either true or false.
Strings are either single-quote or double-quote. You can forget about thread and userdata.</li>
  <li>nil is a non-value. A variable will have the value nil before it’s assigned a proper value.</li>
  <li>In conditionals: nil and false are falsy, the rest are thruthy.</li>
  <li>Lua has a type called <code>table</code>, which is also the only data structure it has. Tables implements
associative arrays. Associative arrays can be indexed by both numbers and other types, such as
strings. They have no fixed size and elements can be added dynamically. Tables are often called
objects. They are created like this:</li>
</ul>



<p>Values are assigned like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>20</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>
<span>new_table</span><span>[</span><span>"x"</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>"test"</span>
<span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span>                    <span>-- same as a["x"] = 10</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They can have functions and are generally very similar to objects in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conditional branching looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
<span>elseif</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span> <span>then</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>300</span>
<span>else</span> <span>variable</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Loops look like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is <em>i = first</em>, <em>last</em>, <em>delta</em>. <code>break</code> can be used, but continue cannot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions are declared like this:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>arg1</span> <span>+</span> <span>arg2</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and are called like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>added_number</span> <span>=</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see functions called like this:</p>



<p>then the functions <code>func1</code> and <code>func2</code> belongs to the table (object) <code>a</code>. Using colon is syntactic
sugar for passing the object itself as an argument to the function. That means <code>a:func1()</code> is
similar to <code>a.func1(a)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s the important stuff. You can read the <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/">Lua 5.3 Reference Manual</a>
if you care about the details.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>If you go to Help –&gt; About Wireshark –&gt; Folders, you’ll find all the folders Wireshark reads Lua
scripts from. Choose either the Personal Lua Plugins, Global Lua Plugins or Personal configuration
folder. E.g. <em>C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\2.4.2</em> on Windows. The script will be active when
Wireshark is started. You have to restart Wireshark after you do changes to the script, or reload
all the Lua scripts with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m using the latest version at the current date. What I’m doing here might not work on earlier
versions.</p>

<h3 id="the-protocol">The protocol</h3>

<p>The most interesting protocol to investigate in this post would probably be a custom one that
Wireshark doesn’t know of already, but all the custom protocols I’ve worked with have been work
related and I can’t post information about them here. So instead we’ll look at the
<a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/">MongoDB wire protocol</a>.</p>

<p><em>(There is already a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/Mongo">Mongo dissector</a> in Wireshark, but I will not use that one.)</em></p>

<p>According to the specification linked to above, the MongoDB wire protocol is a TCP/IP protocol
using port number 27017. The byte ordering is little endian, meaning the least significant byte
comes first. Most protocols are big endian. The only difference is the ordering of the bytes. If
we had an int32 for example, with these bytes: <code>00 4F 23 11</code> in big endian, then the little endian
version would be <code>11 23 4F 00</code>. This is something must to take into account when writing the
dissector.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll only take a look at the header of the protocol. It looks like this</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/mongodb-wire-protocol-header.png" alt="MongoDB protocol header"></p>

<p>We can see that it has four int32s, each containing 4 bytes, because 4*8 = 32.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-boilerplate-code">Setting up the boilerplate code</h3>

<p>Let’s start by setting up some of the boilerplate code that’s needed in all dissectors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We start my creating a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_Proto">Proto</a> (protocol) object and call it <code>mongodb_protocol</code>. The
table constructor takes two arguments: <code>name</code> and <code>description</code>. The protocol requires a <code>fields</code>
table and a dissector function. We haven’t added any fields yet, so the <code>fields</code> table is empty. The
dissector function is called once for every packet of our type.</p>

<p>The dissector function has three parameters: <code>buffer</code>, <code>pinfo</code> and <code>tree</code>. <code>buffer</code> contains the
packet’s buffer and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_Tvb">Tvb object</a>. It contains the data we want to dissect. <code>pinfo</code>
contains the columns of the packet list and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Pinfo.html#lua_class_Pinfo">Pinfo object</a>. Finally, <code>tree</code> is
the tree root and is a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tree.html#lua_class_TreeItem">TreeItem object</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/columns.png" alt="Columns in packet list "></p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/tree.png" alt="Tree in packet details pane"></p>

<p>Inside the dissector function, we start by checking the length of the buffer and then returning if
it’s empty.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>pinfo</code> object contains the columns in the packet list. We can use it to
set the protocol name when we receive a packet of MongoDB type. On the script’s first line we set
the name of the protocol to be “MongoDB” (by passing the name to the constructor). We set the
protocol column name here</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the protocol column name changes from TCP to MONGODB:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/protocol-column.png" alt="Packet list protocol column"></p>

<p>We must then create a sub tree in the tree structure found in the Packet Details pane. It done by
adding an additional tree item to the tree object that was passed as an argument to the dissector
function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The string is the name of the sub tree. Without having added any fields it will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/packet-pane-1.png" alt="Packet pane with MongoDB but without fields"></p>

<p>Finally, we must assign the protocol to a port. In my case, I’ll use port 59274, because that’s the
port I use to connect to the Mongo database.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>"udp.port"</code> can also be used, if the protocol uses UDP rather than TCP.</p>

<h3 id="adding-fields">Adding fields</h3>

<p>The script already runs at this stage, but it isn’t doing anything useful. For the script to do
something useful we have to add the fields that we want to parse. Fields are made by creating
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_class_ProtoField">ProtoField</a> objects. We can start off simple by adding only the first field.
The first field in the MongoDB wire protocol specification is the message length, which is an int32.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proto</span><span>(</span><span>"MongoDB"</span><span>,</span>  <span>"MongoDB Protocol"</span><span>)</span>

<span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>

<span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>dissector</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>,</span> <span>pinfo</span><span>,</span> <span>tree</span><span>)</span>
  <span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>buffer</span><span>:</span><span>len</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> <span>end</span>

  <span>pinfo</span><span>.</span><span>cols</span><span>.</span><span>protocol</span> <span>=</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>subtree</span> <span>=</span> <span>tree</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(),</span> <span>"MongoDB Protocol Data"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>tcp_port</span> <span>=</span> <span>DissectorTable</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"tcp.port"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tcp_port</span><span>:</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>59274</span><span>,</span> <span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add the following above the dissector function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProtoField</span><span>.</span><span>int32</span><span>(</span><span>"mongodb.message_length"</span><span>,</span> <span>"messageLength"</span><span>,</span> <span>base</span><span>.</span><span>DEC</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first argument is used as a label in the filter settings, second is used as a label in the sub
tree and the last is used to decide how the variable’s value should be displayed. In this case I
want to show the value in decimal, but I could also use <code>base.HEX</code> to show it in hexadecimal format.
Hexadecimal format doesn’t work for int32 though.</p>

<p><code>ProtoField</code> has several types of functions we can use: <code>uint8()</code>, <code>uint16()</code>, <code>string()</code> and so on.
We have to use the one that matches the specification. A list of all the functions can be found
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Proto.html#lua_fn_ProtoField_char_abbr___name____base____valuestring____mask____desc__">here</a>.</p>

<p>We then add the field to the <code>fields</code> table of the protocol:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mongodb_protocol</span><span>.</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>message_length</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and finally add the field to the sub tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>subtree</span><span>:</span><span>add_le</span><span>(</span><span>message_length</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I use <code>add_le</code> rather than <code>add</code>, because we are working with a little-endian protocol. If the
protocol was big endian we would have to use <code>add</code>. The function takes two arguments: the field we
made further up, and a <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/lua_module_Tvb.html#lua_class_TvbRange">buffer range</a>. We can get a range of the buffer by using
the range function that is a part of the buffer object. <code>buffer(offset,length)</code> is the short form
for the range function. <code>buffer(0,4)</code> means we want to start at the first byte, and then take 4
bytes. The reason we want to start at 0 is because we’re dealing with the first field in the header.
We take 4 bytes because that is the size of an int32.</p>

<p>After reloading the Lua script with <strong>Ctrl+Shift+L</strong> Wireshark should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mika-s.github.io/assets/creating-wireshark-dissectors-1/messageLength-added.png" alt="Message length added to sub tree"></p>

<p>We can see that it parses the messageLength correctly. We can also see that we don’t …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody"> <center> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pOZhmE42D1WrCWATLK/giphy.gif"> </center><p>If you ever told me you are learning to code (or anything, really), chances are I told you you should have your blog and write in it. Although I discussed this topic in person with a lot of people, there are only small texts about it on blog posts I wrote about other topics (<a href="https://leportella.com/my-experience-with-blogs.html">[1]</a>, <a href="https://leportella.com/boosting-your-career.html">[2]</a>). This blog post is dedicated to <em>why you should have your own (independent) blog</em>. Because people have different ways of seeing the world I divided it into two sections of <em>why:</em></p><ul><li><a href="#philosophical-reasons">Philosophical reasons to have a blog</a></li><li><a href="#selfish-reasons">Selfish reasons to have a blog</a></li></ul><p>I also wrote a section on <a href="#excuses">common excuses</a> that people give me to not write a blog post and my answers to them!</p><p>And finally, if you are convinced, there is a section dedicated to <a href="#what"><em>what</em> to write about</a>.</p><h2 id="philosophical-reasons">Philosophical reasons to have a blog</h2><h3 id="you-should-have-your-own-place-in-the-internet">You should have your own place in the internet</h3><p>If you notice, the internet of today is basically made of a couple of big websites that try to gather every content there is. Have you ever talked to an older person that thinks Facebook IS the internet? Yes, that’s exactly what I am talking about.</p><p>Having your <em>independent</em> blog is an excellent way to share what you think in a decentralized way, independent of any major company that may add a paywall to it (Medium, I am looking at you). On his post “<a href="https://ramalho.org/wiki/doku.php?id=porque_cada_pessoa_deve_ter_seu_site_na_web">why every person should have their own website on the internet</a>”, <a href="https://ramalho.org/">Luciano Ramalho</a> writes something that summarizes what I think:</p><blockquote><p><em>“If everybody starts to create their own website, we will start the long and essential process of taking back the control of the Web: the Web is ours to use it as we like, and not to be controlled by half dozen of mega industries with their opaques algorithms.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Writing is a way of sharing knowledge and a way to increase opportunities for learning to other people. Not everyone had access to a good university or the best books available. Sharing things you have learned can help others grow, can help change their lives and relate to your story or learn with you. Of course, not everyone has access to the internet, but it a good way of starting something for a greater good.</p><p>If you come from a country whose first language is not English, you can create opportunities for people that didn’t have the opportunity to learn that language! The best content is usually written in English, but for third world countries, learning English is quite a privilege, so imagine the impact of writing good content on your language!</p><h3 id="each-person-should-drive-their-presence-on-the-internet">Each person should drive their presence on the internet</h3><p>More and more it becomes really hard to stay away from the internet and social media. It is important to create a digital presence that associates your name to good things and to what <em>you</em> want your name to be associated with. Creating a blog and sharing what you know is an excellent way to position yourself online, and making sure people know you for something better than just social media.</p><h2 id="selfish-reasons">Selfish reasons to have a blog</h2><h3 id="writing-as-a-tool-for-learning">Writing as a tool for learning</h3><p>Writing is an excellent tool for learning. When you decide to write a blog post about what you are learning, not only you need to understand it well enough to make it clear, but also you need to create a structure for the post, which helps you structure your studies in the meantime.</p><p>Let’s take <a href="https://leportella.com/julia-language.html">my blog post about the Julia Language</a> as example. I needed to study the language for an episode of my podcast. After a couple of lines of code, I thought it was good enough, but then I decided to write the post. After that, I realized so much I haven’t studied yet! Who created the language and why? What is considered the best feature of the language? How can I integrate with Jupyter notebooks? And so on. I spent a few more hours understanding the language in order to create the post and this experience was so much better than just following some tutorial and write some lines of code.</p><p><strong>Practice leads to perfection</strong> Like anything in life, you can only get better if you practice. Your first blog post will probably not be great, nor your second, maybe not even your third. But you should write them anyway. The more you write, the more you can improve your writing. You will need to read other blog posts and articles and incorporate different ways of writing to your own. You can only be a good writer, if you practice. So… practice on your own blog!</p><h3 id="feedback-is-a-gift">Feedback is a gift!</h3><p>If you are insecure about writing a blog post, you can share it with your friend and ask for feedback! It is an excellent way of improving your writing while you are developing your skills. So use this opportunity to learn how to take constructive criticism. It is important to understand that feedback is a gift, and that a person took time from their lives and gave you feedback to help you improve. So use your blog posts to get feedback from your friends (and even people that comment on your posts) and learn how to grow through it. You can only gain from it!</p><h3 id="build-your-career">Build your career</h3><p>In today’s world, being visible is an excellent way to stand out and get better jobs in better companies. In tech there are several ways of doing this, you can organize meetups, give talks in conferences, have a Youtube channel, a podcast, etc. However, not everyone wants or is comfortable with this kind of exposure. In my opinion, a blog is the best way of share your work with minimal personal exposure. You don’t even need to add a personal photo to have one! You can improve your career even if you are too shy to give a talk 😉</p><h2 id="excuses">Common excuses not to write</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Excuse</strong></th><th><strong>My answer</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>“I am not an expert”</td><td>That’s ok! You don’t have to be an expert to explain something you know! On every blog post that I am not completely sure of what I am writing I make it explicit that this is based on my knowledge. Just make sure to be open to criticism and feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>“Everybody know this”</td><td>Even if something was written a thousand times, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t write about it. I usually search for different articles on a single topic to help me understand something! Not always what was written before works for everyone. Maybe what you wrote will be good for a specific person. And that’s all you need</td></tr><tr><td>“What if I make mistakes?”</td><td>No problem at all. Life is full of mistakes. Make sure you add a comment on the beginning of an old post or even change the text. You don’t have to be right all the time and you didn’t write in stone. If you make a mistake, go back and fix it. You will only grow from the experience</td></tr><tr><td>“I have nothing to write about”</td><td>I made a whole section about it 😉</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="what">What to write?</h2><p>If you are here I am assuming I was able to convince you to start blogging! Congratulations! That’s a huge step! Here are the topics you can write about (based on my personal experience):</p><ul><li><strong>You can share a part of your life that was important to you and that can be used as inspiration by others!</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html">I wrote about how I changed careers from oceanographer to developer</a> and how hard that decision was.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you see something online (like a Twitter thread) that talks about something that deserves to be more than a transient topic in someone’s timeline</strong><ul><li>Example: One guy asked on Twitter for arguments he could use to convince his company to engage in a tech community. The answers were so amazing that I thought it would give <a href="https://leportella.com/why-you-should-be-in-communities.html">an excellent blog post</a>!</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you want to study something and want to structure your thoughts</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/julia-language.html">I wrote a blog post about Julia language</a> so I would know the minimum of the language to interview a guest on my podcast. Without the blog post, I was through with my studies after a couple of lines of code, but when I decided to write a blog post about it I realized how much I was missing and started all over!</li></ul></li><li><strong>When you had some interesting experience</strong><ul><li>Example: <a href="https://leportella.com/new-eng-stripe.html">my first 6 months at Stripe</a> were a surreal experience that I loved! It was something so different from what I have lived as an onboarding experience so far that I thought it was an amazing thing to share with my friends.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When it took you more than an hour to find an answer for a problem</strong><ul><li>Example: I needed to add a relationship model to an SQLAlchemy table that already existed. This problem took me 3 days and I asked for help from multiple people. The final answer was <em>extremely</em> simple, but <a href="https://leportella.com/relationship-sqlalchemy.html">I decided to write it anyway</a>. A couple of months ago someone commented that I saved their day because of my blog post.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When it took you more than 5 minutes to answer a question someone made you</strong><ul><li>Example: One time a guy came to my Telegram and asked me: “should I have my blog in Medium or somewhere else?” My answer to him was long and detailed and took me several minutes, so <a href="https://leportella.com/my-experience-with-blogs.html">I decided to write about it on a blog post</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed the post and let me know if you started a blog after reading it!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How do you make a highly scalable, highly performant blogging service for as little server cost as possible?</p>
<p>On-demand static site generation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Recently on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tl.gd&amp;src=typed_query">I've seen a lot of people use TwitLonger</a>. TwitLonger is a site separate from Twitter that lets users log in with their Twitter account and create longer, more traditional blog-style type of posts.</p>
<p>TwitLonger is a free-to-use service, however, it's littered with ads to pay for the server maintenance costs. TwitLonger is a self-funded project run by <a href="https://twitter.com/stuartgibson">one person</a>, so I mostly believe their claim that the ads are required to keep the site alive.</p>
<p>Oh also: TwitLonger is also <a href="https://twitter.com/twitlonger/status/18896126622?s=20">well over 10 years old</a> (crazy)!</p>
<p>Given that, the question that comes in mind is: <strong>Can we make a TwitLonger alternative that is ad-free in the year 2020?</strong></p>
<p>Short answer: yes! — via on-demand static site generation (SSG).</p>
<h2>The JAMstack</h2>
<p>In case you've haven't been paying attention to recent trends in web development, many engineering teams have been adopting the "JAM stack" — short for javascript, APIs, and markup.</p>
<p>The name and the components of that "stack" aren't really important. In fact, I would say it's less of an actual stack and more of general architecture philosophy that exploits one thing:</p>
<p>How cheap and fast it is to serve static assets over a CDN.</p>
<p>With the JAMstack, you pre-render all your site's pages to static HTML during build time so that the resulting assets of your site are primarily static HTML pages. When content changes, the site is simply re-built.</p>
<p>The end result is extremely performant and scalable websites that cost near nothing to host.</p>
<h2>Taking the JAMstack further: On-demand SSG</h2>
<p>For a user-generated blog site like TwitLonger, the JAMstack in this traditional sense won't work. There will be a point when re-building the whole site (even with an incremental approach) isn't feasible and another technique is needed.</p>
<p>So what do we do now?</p>
<p>Instead of re-rendering the whole site, we pre-render a single static HTML page on each new post. The resulting HTML page can then be saved in some storage bucket and served over CDN.</p>
<p>That's what on-demand SSG is — at the point in time when a user creates content, pre-render it.</p>
<p>If hooked up correctly, this approach does not require <em>any</em> backend code in order for the page to be viewed and scales extremely well.</p>
<h2>The implementation —&nbsp;<a href="http://longtweet.io/">longtweet.io</a></h2>
<p>You're looking at it.</p>
<p>You can login and <a href="https://longtweet.io/">create a new post now</a>.</p>
<p>When you create a new post, it calls an AWS lambda function. In that function is where this service takes your content, pre-renders it to a static HTML file, and saves it to an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>From there, S3 and CloudFront handle the rest. The site is set up to be hosted from this S3 bucket so after the file gets dropped in, it's live.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>It's excellent.</p>
<p>Viewing a post is highly optimized and virtually free. When any user from around the world views a page, it's readily available at network edges via CloudFront.</p>
<p>I maxed out what I could for free on <a href="https://k6.io/cloud">k6 cloud</a> and longtweet was able to handle sub 10 millisecond response times at 50 requests per second for 5 minutes — all while still on the free tier in AWS.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/load-test-result.png" alt="Load test result"></p>
<h2>Taking performance further with minimalism</h2>
<p>For both performance and cost reasons, longtweet serves a very small bundle.</p>
<p>Longtweet posts are almost entirely static content with just a tiny bit of javascript used to show author controls.</p>
<p>The CSS and JS are inlined into the post's HTML making this beautiful network tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/longtweet-network-tab.png" alt="longtweet network tab"></p>
<p>In 6.4kB in one request, the whole site is loaded (and we could push this minimalism further if we wanted to).</p>
<p>The minimalism makes a big difference for performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://longtweet.io/lighthouse-vs.jpg" alt="lighthouse scores. longtweet vs twitlonger"></p>
<p>Pictured left are the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a> scores for longtweet and on the right are the lighthouse scores for TwitLonger (with ads).</p>
<p>The rest of the pages on longtweet are client-side rendered with <a href="https://preactjs.com/">preact</a>. The resulting bundle there is around 30kB.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<p>So at this point, you might be asking the big question: how do you change the pages after they've already been pre-rendered?</p>
<p>Well the simple answer is just render them all again.</p>
<p>Doing migrations of a site like this would require all of the users posts to be re-rendered. In order to make that possible, save the raw content to some DB explicitly for a migration.</p>
<hr>
<p>Longtweet is also open-source. <a href="https://github.com/ricokahler/longtweet.io">Check out the source code here.</a></p>
<p>Feel free to suggest ideas and contribute in any way. Transparency and simplicity are at the heart of this app. There are no plans on monetizing this.</p>

          <div role="main">
            
  <div id="managing-remote-unix-and-windows-machines-via-ssh">

<p><span>New in version 2020.7.0.</span></p>
<p>Using <em>salt-sproxy</em>, besides regular Minions, regular Proxy Minions, and
standalone Proxy Minions (managed by <em>salt-sproxy</em> itself), you can also manage
arbitrary machines via SSH, in the same way as you’d normally do through
<a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/">salt-ssh</a>. In fact, this
is actually done through the <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proxy/ssh.html#ssh-proxy"><span>SSH Proxy Module</span></a> shipped together with this
package, which in turn invokes <em>salt-ssh</em> internals. While <em>salt-ssh</em> has
been part of the Salt suite for years, it has always been decoupled from the
rest. One of the evident implications is that you manage some devices by
running <code><span>salt</span></code>, and others by running <code><span>salt-ssh</span></code>. <em>salt-sproxy</em> aims to
abstract that away, and provide a single, uniform methodology for managing
whatever flavours of Salt you want, through the same command and offering the
same features.</p>
<p>In essence, using the <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proxy/ssh.html#ssh-proxy"><span>SSH Proxy Module</span></a>, <em>salt-sproxy</em> spins up a temporary
Proxy Minion locally, which means you can use it to manage arbitrary machines
over SSH, and you can continue using the usual <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/targeting.html#targeting"><span>Targeting</span></a> mechanisms, or
execute Salt commands over the REST API (see also <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salt_sapi.html#salt-sapi"><span>salt-sapi</span></a>).</p>
<div>
<p>Important</p>
<p>As this feature depends on two external modules, provides with
<em>salt-sproxy</em>, you will need to make sure your installation is aware of
those. You ave multiple options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute passing the <code><span>--sync-proxy</span></code> and <code><span>--sync-executors</span></code> on the
command line.</li>
<li>Set <code><span>sync_proxy:</span> <span>true</span></code> and <code><span>sync_executors:</span> <span>true</span></code> in the Master
config file.</li>
<li>Configure the <code><span>file_roots</span></code> on the Master, as detailed in <a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runner.html#runner"><span>The Proxy Runner</span></a>,
then execute <code><span>salt-run</span> <span>saltutil.sync_all</span></code> (or
<code><span>saltutil.sync_proxymodules</span></code> + <code><span>saltutil.sync_executors</span></code>, if you only
want the SSH code, ignorning anything else). See also
<a href="https://salt-sproxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html#best-practices"><span>Salt SProxy Best Practices</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="pillar">
<h2>Pillar<a href="#pillar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The configuration is aligned to the general Proxy Minion standards: put the
connection details and credentials under the <code><span>proxy</span></code> key in the Proxy config
or Pillar.</p>
<dl>
<dt><code><span>host</span></code></dt>
<dd>The IP address or the hostname of the remove machine to manage.</dd>
<dt><code><span>port</span></code></dt>
<dd>Integer, the port number to use when establishing he connection
(defaults to 22).</dd>
<dt><code><span>user</span></code></dt>
<dd>The username required for authentication.</dd>
<dt><code><span>passwd</span></code></dt>
<dd>The password used for authentication.</dd>
<dt><code><span>priv</span></code></dt>
<dd>Absolute path to the private SSH key used for authentication.</dd>
<dt><code><span>priv_passwd</span></code></dt>
<dd>The SSH private key password.</dd>
<dt><code><span>timeout</span></code>: 30</dt>
<dd>The SSH timeout. Defaults to 30 seconds.</dd>
<dt><code><span>sudo</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Execute commands as sudo.</dd>
<dt><code><span>tty</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Connect over tty.</dd>
<dt><code><span>sudo_user</span></code></dt>
<dd>The username that should execute the commands as sudo.</dd>
<dt><code><span>remote_port_forwards</span></code></dt>
<dd>Enable remote port forwarding. Example: <code><span>8888:my.company.server:443</span></code>.
Multiple remote port forwardings are supported, using comma-separated
values, e.g., <code><span>8888:my.company.server:443,9999:my.company.server:80</span></code>.</dd>
<dt><code><span>identities_only</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Execute SSH with <code><span>-o</span> <span>IdentitiesOnly=yes</span></code>. This option is intended for
situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities and allow ssh
to ignore those identities and use the only one specified in options.</dd>
<dt><code><span>winrm</span></code>: <code><span>False</span></code></dt>
<dd>Flag that tells Salt to connect to a Windows machine. This option requires
the <code><span>saltwinshell</span></code> to be installed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, let’s say you put the following in the Pillar:</p>
<p><code><span>/srv/salt/pillar/ssh.sls</span></code></p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>proxy</span><span>:</span>
  <span>proxytype</span><span>:</span> <span>ssh</span>
  <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>srv.example.com</span>
  <span>user</span><span>:</span> <span>test</span>
  <span>passwd</span><span>:</span> <span>test</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code><span>/srv/salt/pillar/top.sls</span></code></p>

<p>Assuming that your configuration is correct, you can then start executing Salt
commands as usual, to manage the remote machine:</p>

<p>Character LCDs have been around for a long time. These displays contain a number of discinct blocks—each capable of displaying a single character—so displaying
scrolling text would traditionally involve just shifting characters left one block at a time.
That’s fine and all, but why not take advantage of free time during quarantine to raise the bar.. 😉</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Most character displays utilise the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller">Hitachi HD44780 controller chip</a>,
which has the neat feature of letting us define and use up to eight custom characters, each 5x8 pixels in size.
Mine uses this chip, so I’ll be taking advantage of repeatedly rendering custom characters to pull off smooth scrolling text.</p>
<p>I connected an Arduino Leonardo to my <a href="https://joeraut.com/posts/interfacing-salvaged-lcd-display/">salvaged display</a> over its 4-bit interface, and got to work on the software side.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>As we use an Arduino, the software written is in C++. Source code available at the end of the article.</p>
<p>We allocate memory for a canvas that will contain the raw pixel data for the message we want to display. We make use of a
<a href="https://github.com/Ameba8195/Arduino/blob/master/hardware_v2/cores/arduino/font5x7.h">5x7-pixel ASCII font</a>, and for each ASCII character
in the message string, we place the corresponding character at the appropriate location on the canvas using the <code>memcpy</code> function.</p>
<p>In order to display our canvas on the LCD, we define a function to generate display-ready custom characters by grabbing pixel data from appropriate locations on
the canvas. For each frame of the scrolling process, we can simply increment the horizontal index of the location on the canvas by one, which results
in the message on-screen scrolling left by one pixel. These custom characters are then pushed to the display, and presto—smooth-scrolling text!</p>
<p>There was a slight complication I glossed over—the memory structure of custom characters differs to that of the font and canvas. The font and canvas use five
bytes to represent each character, with each byte representing one 7-pixel column (the most significant bit is ignored). The custom character format,
however, uses 8 bytes—each representing one row of the character. To solve this issue, we define a function <code>transpose</code> which takes care of mapping
the canvas format to the custom character format.</p>

<p>The Arduino sketch is available here: <a href="https://joeraut.com/files/posts/smooth-scrolling-text-on-character-lcds/SmoothScrollingText.ino">SmoothScrollingText.ino</a>.</p>
<p>It should run on most Arduino devices, but I have only tested it on an Arduino Leonardo. Be sure to modify the LCD pin setup for your hardware.</p>

Focus. Flow.</p><p>They are all essential for productivity, but many of us have the wrong idea about them.</p><p>We think we should focus on a single task for&nbsp;<em>hours</em>&nbsp;at a time.</p><p>That idea is outdated.</p><p>Few of us are able to focus for even 1 hour without any interruptions, from others or ourselves.</p><p>While training our focus and lengthening our attention span is an important and useful daily practice, it's foolish to expect ourselves to work 1, 2, or 4 hours at a time, totally focused. Our mind has its limits.</p><p><strong>We aren't computers. We can't go at full speed 24/7. We're humans and we need breaks.</strong></p><p>If we want to perform at a high level consistently, breaks are necessary. Elite athletes don't train all day long without rest. They focus on recovery nearly as much as at their actual performance.</p><p>According to DeskTime, an app tracking people’s activity on their computer, the top 10 % most productive people work on average for 52 minutes and then&nbsp;<a href="https://desktime.com/blog/17-52-ratio-most-productive-people">take a break for 17 minutes.</a></p><p>So let's take a look at how we can use good breaks to improve our mental performance.</p><h2>What is an effective break (and what is not)?</h2><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/good_vs_bad_breaks_bg_tw.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Good breaks vs bad breaks - bad breaks derail the day"></p><p>We'll start with bad breaks—breaks that make you feel worse or lead to unproductive states of mind.</p><p><strong>Bad breaks:</strong></p><ul><li>Social media use (without effective boundaries in place).</li><li>Watching YouTube, Netflix, Twitch,...</li><li>Eating junk food</li><li>Browsing shopping sites aimlessly</li></ul><p>You can do all of these activities during your leisure time, no problem there, but if you try to fit them into your work day as a break, they often derail it.</p><p><strong>Avoid highly stimulating, addictive activities during your breaks.</strong></p><p>Instead, choose break activities that give your mind a chance to relax.</p><p>What's a good and effective break?</p><p>Here are some ideas for you!</p><p><strong>Good breaks</strong>:</p><ul><li>Brew coffee or tea.</li><li>Do a breathing exercise or meditate.</li><li>Stare out of a window.</li><li>Read a page of a book or a blog post.<br>This can be a good substitute for social media checking.</li><li>Tidy up a part of your room.</li><li>Lie down your eyes closed or nap.</li><li>Stand up and stretch.</li><li>Take a short walk.<br>(Studies say that taking a walk through nature boosts your ability to      concentrate by as much as 20 % and at the same time reduces your stress      levels.)</li><li>Have a chat with a roommate or a colleague.</li><li>Call someone.</li><li>Do a quick workout.</li><li>Take a nap.</li><li>Take a shower.</li><li>Eat a healthy snack.</li><li>Doodle.</li></ul><p>All of these activities let your mind switch from concentration to relaxation.</p><p>Whichever activity you choose, do something that doesn't stimulate the same part of the brain you're using for work.</p><p><strong>When you let your mind wander more often, you can stumble upon new insights that wouldn't occur to you in the heads-down work mode.</strong>&nbsp;Many creative people report they have their best ideas in a shower, in a bath, or while doing menial work.</p><p>In fact, one of the best break options is to not using your brain at all for a moment—<em>by taking a nap.</em></p><h3>Nap your way to increased productivity</h3><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/napping.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Nap your way to increased productivity"></p><p>Napping is an awesome skill to develop.</p><p>Many people say they don’t like napping or sleeping during the day in general.

That way, we wake up with new energy without feeling tired.</p><p>Even people who sleep all night can enjoy the positive effects of power naps on mood, alertness and mental performance (studying, work).</p><p><strong>How to take a power nap:</strong></p><ol start=""><li>Find a place that is as quiet and dark as possible</li><li>Set a timer on your phone for 25 minutes (it takes a few minutes for you to fall asleep)</li><li>Lay down and relax (don’t tell yourself you have to fall asleep, that way you won’t, maybe try slowing down your breath)</li><li>Wake up refreshed!</li></ol><p>This is how you take a power nap.

    <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p><em>n.b.: None of these ideas are mine alone. Shoulders of giants. Follow the links and use landscape mode for optimal reading experience.</em></p>

<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

</center>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

</center>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

</center>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://brea.ndan.co/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>. Our contributions were using algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>

  <li><strong>Directed graphs</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">State machines</a>, <a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/">λ-calculus</a>, <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/The_web_as_a_directed_graph">the web</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">RNNs</a></li>
  <li><strong>Hypergraphs</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">Knowledge</a>, <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">Zettelkasten</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">categories</a>, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">physics</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkpACe1lx">hypernetworks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<img width="60%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Thistreeisillustratingtherelation%28PSG%29.png">
</center>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Glaucon joins the agora with its usual 30–40 patrons present, most of whom are idling or spectating.  Glaucon has ambitious and unusual goals for his computing environment, and high standards of openness and freedom for the hardware he wants to use, but isn’t sure where to start implementing what he wants.  Socrates, one of the regulars, having experience in this area, explains to Glaucon some of the subtleties of hardware being “open” or “closed”, and clears up some surprising misconceptions that Glaucon likely shares with others in his position.</p>

<h2 id="dramatis-personae">Dramatis personae</h2>

<p>In order of appearance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Glaucon:</strong> A Cretin visitor to the agora, with grand ideals of freedom and minimalism in computing</li>
  <li><strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> A self-taught Ithacan sysadmin with no engineering knowledge</li>
  <li><strong>Socrates:</strong> Famed philosopher-engineer of Athens</li>
  <li><strong>Adeimantus:</strong> Another Cretin, a regular visitor, impatient with his countryman’s idealism</li>
  <li><strong>Polemarchus:</strong> A Spartan</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> why hello<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I need some help with something <br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Does anyone know of any completely free hardware computers? I’m looking and I can’t find any<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Who wants to tell him<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I thought there were at least one or two<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> like a weak 16-bit/32-bit one at least<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thrasymachus: why didn’t you mention POWER?<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> ?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> POWER is a remarkably open architecture<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I wonder if it would meet Glaucon’s high standards<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it’s too new<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> only the oldest workable tech will do, because performance is bloat<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thinkpad with pre-ME CPU, Libreboot, and Trisquel<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> no networking because I haven’t found an ISP that will give me the source to their CRM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> people on /g/ are saying system76 but that’s not at all what I’m looking for<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> they’re all Intel or AMD CPUs<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> Pinebook is closer</p>

<h2 id="the-spectre-of-management-engines">The spectre of management engines</h2>

<p><strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Socrates may be able to help you<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> hi Socrates<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://www.raptorcs.com/content/TL2B01/intro.html">https://www.raptorcs.com/content/TL2B01/intro.html</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> &gt;OpenPOWER<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> BEAUTIFUL<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> POWER arch, auditable/disablable management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is exactly what I was looking for<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Socrates wins<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> management?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> like IME?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OpenBMC<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc">https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> this is its own OS?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I’m still a bit lost<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Intel ME is a small CPU tacked on the side running Minix<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like it or not, management is actually pretty cool and useful<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the reason why ME is shit is because it’s not owned by you, so while you can control it (and it is useful for everybody), people don’t trust Intel to make it secure and safe against economic/political pressures<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> what if I wanted to avoid it entirely<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s why I bought a 2003 Tower to begin with<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> then disable it<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> there must be an option to have it not be there at all<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> probably, if you email them they’ll probably ship it nulled out<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> or give you instructions on how to do the same<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> do you know of any other boards like this you could link?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> nothing at this level ships without management<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (its not inherently bad)<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> its basically just Wake-on-LAN but extended<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> what does ship without management<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> to get stuff that ships without management you have to go into the low end devices that are used by people who don’t care about openness<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but genuinely, management is orthogonal to openness/security<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> such as?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> ah shit, this board is $4k<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> lmao<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I mean, if you buy old pre-ME business laptops, they’re probably the best trade-off between good devices<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s what I figured<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but really, don’t ask for “no management”, ask for management you can control<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> its the difference between &lt;manufacturer BIOS&gt; and Libreboot, etc<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBMC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBMC</a> is probably a better explanation<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> so there essentially aren’t affordable options for open source CPUs at all<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> OpenPOWER<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> as was linked<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if you want to wait another decade, we might get some traction in RISC-V<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but for now, RISC-V competes with ARM, not Intel/AMD<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that thing was 4000 bux<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> listen bud freedom doesn’t come free<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://fglt.nl/assets/img/agora/freedom-aint-free.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/856/704/8b2.jpg</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> praise Jesus<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> fugg</p>

<h2 id="the-economics-of-open-hardware">The economics of open hardware</h2>

<p><strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand why I can’t get an SBC with an open source CPU<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> that’s because you don’t understand market economics, but that’s ok<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> if SBC grade is what you’re looking for, you can get RISC-V now for a shit perf:$ ratio, but a low absolute cost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> okay<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but a few hundred dollars would be possible<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> not just 4k<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> probably we’re talking Raspberry Pi perf for the cost of a decent laptop<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah that’s reasonable<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> and no software support<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards">https://www.sifive.com/boards</a><br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I think I need to learn something about RISC-V<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> basically just imagine the ARM product line but open source<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> I ain’t mad at that<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> looks like you can get an unleashed board for ~$1000<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> still a bit high<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> but much more reasonable<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> maybe I’ll take the dive eventually<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> sadly, that’s the two ends of the spectrum right now<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> It’s getting better<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you can get an Raspberry Pi for $1000, or you can get a POWER workstation for $5000<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I might just get one of those Rockchip SBCs instead<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> or ARM SBCs<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t have 1000 bux to drop on a PC I want to use rarely<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Rockchip is ARM<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> right<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> well either way<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> is Mali open source?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I thought it needed blobs<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> oh, ARM give you some open source userspace drivers<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> standby for 0 perf lmoa :(((<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I was gonna just get an ARM SBC do you have any suggestions<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I know the banana pi is mostly open software/hardware<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> what’s your use case?<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I need about 1GHz CPU and 1-2GB of RAM, I’ve been using an old 2003 Dell Tower for minimalist Linux, right now Alpine, and a simple web browser, text-based email client, text-based torrent client, text-based IRC client, and like mpv or something<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s about it<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> no, tell me your use case<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s my use case<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> what you’re upgrading from<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t understand<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s what I’m upgrading from, that tower, do you want the model<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> ok<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> just get whatever the most-FOSS SBC you can find is<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> but just remember that half of them aren’t actually FOSS<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> (either because they are crippled when running FOSS only, or they ship violating blobs)<br>
<strong>Thrasymachus:</strong> Way to crush his dreams, Socrates<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> yeah it’s not a great situation right now<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> Thrasymachus: he wants everything for nothing, the only solution they have is to pay and support showing that its a workable market, or to just deal with compromise<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> or sit on his hands and hope the rest of the world carries them I guess<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> <a href="http://nonfree.pizza/">http://nonfree.pizza/</a><br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t want everything for nothing<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I want to know what my options are<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t know much about open source hardware so I’m learning<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I only just jumped off from using Windows 10 daily lmao<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> I really suggest you understand what management is though, because you went from “I don’t know where OpenBMC sits in the stack” to “management bad”<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> so you p much only know the “IME is bad” bit of the story, which is absolutely true, but only one page of a very large book<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I never said management bad<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I asked if there was anything I could get with no management<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> to understand the range of these devices<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you said you didn’t want management at all, which pigeonholes you to “very old” or “very low end”<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t mind very old<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> the problem is very old is often very proprietary as well<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> management is now the default, so you need to make some compromise: remove it, at cost, or pick something old, at a performance penalty, or pick something low end, at a perf penalty, or pick something where the management is open, at a cost<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I also wanna avoid x86 bc then I can pigeonhole myself into only using Linux/BSD<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> interesting statement<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> pick x86_64 and you get to run anything, including a better range of Linux, and other interesting stuff like Haiku, Plan 9, etc<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s the opposite of what I want<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I don’t want to run anything<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> if I did I’d have kept my gaming PC<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> then why are you even here?<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> ascetic minimalism and restriction comes at the cost of your own experience<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> perfect<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> that’s exactly what I want<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> then get a Filofax and some stamps<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the computing world is not for you<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you’ve been had, and you’re taking the /g/ minimal desktop thread meme way too hard<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> nah, I’m enjoying myself<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> I just want to take the next step and get more open hardware<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> well<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> you say that but you’re not willing to take what comes with that<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> buying cheap SBCs is usually non-free, even when they have “FOSS” on the sticker<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> usually by taking the allwinner route<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> because it doesn’t have to be expensive<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it is currently<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> the only way to make it not expensive is to support the market now<br>
<strong>Adeimantus:</strong> it has to be expensive when you have low demand and high costs due to lack of scale<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> nah<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like, Raptor are seriously, seriously thinking about pulling from the market<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> because they cant make the economics work<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> because of what Adeimantus said<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> then buy it yourself? I’m not gonna buy a 1000 dollar PC<br>
<strong>Glaucon:</strong> it doesn’t have to cost that much<br>
<strong>Socrates:</strong> like I said, you don’t …</p></div></div>

<p>Resilience is something those who use Kubernetes to run apps and microservices in containers aim for. When a system is resilient, it can handle losing a portion of its microservices and components without the entire system becoming inaccessible.</p>



<p>Resilience is achieved by integrating loosely coupled microservices. When a system is resilient, microservices can be updated or taken down without having to bring the entire system down. Scaling becomes easier too, since you don’t have to scale the whole cloud environment at once.</p>



<p>That said, resilience is not without its challenges. Building microservices that are independent yet work well together is not easy. You also have to create and maintain a reliable system with high fault tolerance. This is where Chaos Engineering comes into play.</p>



<h2>What Is Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Chaos Engineering has been around for almost a decade now but it is still a relevent and useful concept to incorporate into improving your whole systems architecture. In essence, Chaos Engineering is the process of triggering and injecting faults into a system deliberately. Instead of waiting for errors to occur, engineers can take deliberate steps to cause (or simulate) errors in a controlled environment.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering allows for better, more advanced resilience testing. Developers can now experiment in cloud-native distributed systems. Experiments involve testing both the physical infrastructure and the cloud ecosystem.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not a new approach. In fact, companies like Netflix have been using resilience testing through Chaos Monkey, an in-house Chaos Engineering framework designed to improve the strength of cloud infrastructure for years now.</p>



<p>When dealing with a large-scale distributed system, Chaos Engineering provides an empirical way of building confidence by anticipating faults instead of reacting to them. The chaotic condition is triggered intentionally for this purpose.</p>



<p>There are a lot of analogies depicting how Chaos Engineering works, but the traffic light analogy represents the concept best. Conventional testing is similar to testing traffic lights individually to make sure that they work.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, means closing out a busy array of intersections to see how traffic reacts to the chaos of losing traffic lights. Since the test is run deliberately, more insights can be collected from the process.</p>



<h2>Why Use Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Let’s start this part by accepting the fact that chaos engineering and fault testing have a lot of overlaps, but the latter tests a specific condition instead of real chaos. Chaos Engineering actually lets you garner more insights, down to identifying nodes that are not behaving as intended and generating errors under certain conditions.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is not for testing every condition, but it covers a lot of ground. There are several things you can learn about the system through chaos testing.</p>



<ul><li>Inter-service latency causing bottlenecks and grinding the system to a slow pace can be discovered through Chaos Engineering.</li><li>Routine driver checks to identify how drivers of different versions or variations affect system performance and stability.</li><li>Memory and CPU usage being maxed out and how the condition affects your system, particularly in scalable Elastic environments.</li><li>Fault injection, particularly the introduction of multiple faults at the same time.</li><li>Simulating catastrophic failure of the entire cloud architecture or datacenter.</li></ul>



<p>Chaos Engineering, on the other hand, is not very effective when used to test specific faults, especially when the faults are siloed in one or two microservices. Chaos experiments are also more suitable for revealing effects and impacts that you are not aware of and confirming your suspicions after running into several similar errors.</p>



<h2>The Principles of Chaos Engineering</h2>



<p>From the previous explanations, it is clear that Chaos Engineering is meant to uncover faults and weaknesses in a system. You want to run the Chaos experiment in a controlled and close-to-ideal environment so that there is no bias to worry about.</p>



<p>To run the experiment, there are several principles that you need to follow.</p>



<h3>Formulate a Hypothesis</h3>



<p>This is the start of the experiment. You begin by making assumptions about how the system will react when certain faults and conditions are introduced. The hypothesis lets you identify which metrics to measure.</p>



<h3>Identify Variables</h3>



<p>Chaos Engineering relies on real-life events; the Chaos experiment reflects real-life events and potential situations that you want to anticipate. When choosing variables, you have to think about the probability of those variables manifesting and their estimated impact on your system.</p>



<h3>Automation</h3>



<p>Automated orchestration is another important component of Chaos Engineering. Using automated orchestration, you can perform state condition checks and analyze application and data integrity more comprehensively than when you do everything manually. In fact, manual experiments are far from sustainable.</p>



<h3>Reduced Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The next principle is reduced blast radius, which means running the Chaos experiment in a controlled environment to minimize the damage and influence caused by the test. Most developers run Chaos experiments on their production environment, but with added measures put in place to prevent catastrophic failures. Alternatively, you can create a robust testing environment to further reduce the blast radius.</p>



<h3>Scaling the Blast Radius</h3>



<p>The blast radius can be scaled to further identify system faults. Limiting the blast radius too much may not always yield the best results, which is why it is sometimes necessary to scale the blast radius up in order to identify faults that relate to real-life behaviors of the system.</p>



<p>The principles governing Chaos Engineering, when implemented thoroughly, creates the perfect chaos. It is a lot easier to identify faults and understand their impacts when you have a controlled chaos, a robust monitoring routine, and the ability to observe real-life system behaviors when faults are introduced.</p>



<h2>Are You Ready for Chaos Engineering?</h2>



<p>Lastly, it is important to understand whether your organization is ready for Chaos Engineering. Chaos Engineering requires the basic weaknesses to be plugged first. This means getting your system to a point where it is resilient enough to handle network spikes and service failures. Once the prerequisites are met, you can run Chaos experiments to uncover other weaknesses.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering also requires your system to have maximum visibility. Fortunately, most cloud architectures and environments are compatible with monitoring tools that maximize system visibility. Optimize Chaos Engineering to review your systems, seek out new systemic weaknesses and improve your infrastructure’s fault tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When browsing the web, it can often feel like your privacy is being constantly invaded and your data misused; in the most by companies spying on you to advertise things you don’t really need. </p> <p>As the Moneyed app enables users to view their financial data, it’s vital that privacy and security are built into the core of our tech. One security consideration is cookies: if an attacker stole your session identifier, they could pretend to be you, and potentially view your data. </p> <p>Below is a list of some of the cookie-related procedures we follow at Moneyed. To keep everyone’s data safe, other companies should be doing the same with their cookies (but, as the title suggests, they probably aren’t). </p> <h4>1. Use cookies over sessionStorage or localStorage</h4> <p>The session identifier could be stored in a cookie, sessionStorage, or localStorage. Given that the session identifier is only required by the server, access should be restricted to it; this is possible to do with cookies (see number 4), but not possible with sessionStorage and localStorage. </p> <h4>2. Use only strictly necessary cookies</h4> <p>Strictly necessary cookies do not require consent from the user[1]; this avoids the need for an annoying cookie permission popup and signals to the user that you care about their privacy. </p> <h4>3. Set the secure attribute</h4> <p>The secure attribute requires that the browser only accepts the cookie and only shares the cookie if the site is secure, e.g. served over HTTPS, making it harder for a man-in-the-middle attacker to steal the cookie[2, 3]. </p> <h4>4. Set the HttpOnly attribute</h4> <p>The HttpOnly attribute requires that the browser only share the cookie with the server (via HTTP requests) and specifically prevents scripts running in the browser from accessing the cookie; this makes it harder for a cross site scripting (XSS) attacker to steal the cookie[2, 4]. </p> <h4>5. Set the path attribute to '/'</h4> <p>The path attribute specifies which URL paths the cookie is shared with. Setting the path attribute to '/' means the cookie is shared with any path on the domain[2]; this is best practice as most security measures are based on the origin (rather than path). </p> <h4>6. Don’t set the domain attribute</h4> <p>The domain attribute specifies which URL domains the cookie is shared with. Not including/setting the domain activates the host-only-flag, ensuring that the cookie is only shared with the host that set it; this is preferable to explicitly setting the domain as it excludes subdomains. </p> <h4>7. Set the SameSite attribute to Lax or Strict</h4> <p>The SameSite attribute controls when a cookie is shared with cross origin requests. Strict should be used in preference as it prevents any sharing, whereas Lax allows for top level navigation i.e. when a user follows a link from an external site. </p> <h4>8. Use the '__Host-' name prefix</h4> <p>Adding <code>__Host-</code> as a prefix to the cookie name requires that the Secure attribute is set, the Path attribute is set to '/', and the domain attribute is not set; this acts as a failsafe ensuring that the cookie cannot exist without these attributes. </p> <h4>9. Don’t set max-age or expires</h4> <p>By not setting max-age or expires the cookie becomes a session cookie; this ensures that the cookie is deleted when the user’s session ends. The alternative is needing to remember to delete the cookie, or predict the perfect time in the future to schedule a deletion. </p> <h4>10.

    </span><br></undefined><p>It's a PICO-8 implementation of tennis, and it's really good!</p><p>You can play it on mobile through the BBS. I'll give you a few minutes to check it out:</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31450" target="_blank"><em>Play Pico Tennis here</em></a></blockquote><hr><p>Back? Great!

The player returns.</p><p><em>Ad infinitum.</em> Until either the player or opponent breaks the loop, because they failed to return the ball.</p><p>Tennis folks call this a rally, but for us, this repeating structure is the game's core loop. It's exactly what we were looking for.</p><p>A core loop is the game's <em>essential activity</em>. Every sport has one, and every game has one:</p><ul><li>Baseball: a pitcher pitches a ball; a batter hits the ball, or misses.</li><li>Football: a quarterback receives the ball, and makes a play.</li></ul><p>Games have larger loops of course! In baseball, runners run to bases around a diamond. There are innings. There are game series.</p><p>But we seek the smallest, tightest loop of the game. Such that if you take this loop away, the game won't work.</p><p>Can you find a game that <em>doesn't</em> have a core loop? Heck, one can argue that visual novels –&nbsp;which are heavily story-based –&nbsp;have a core loop of dialogue navigation.</p><p>Since <a href="https://teamavocado.co/sports-game">we're making a boxing game</a>, let's identify the core loop:</p><ol><li>A boxer throws a punch.</li><li>An opponent evades or blocks the punch, or throws a punch back.</li></ol><p>From that core idea, we can scope our project.</p><h2 id="define-project-milestones">2. Define project milestones</h2><p>When game developers say to build on a strong core, they refer to core loops.</p><p>Wanna know why?</p><p>Once you've identified your game's core loop, the path forward is clear:</p><ol><li>🧭 <s><strong>The Goal.</strong> Do you want to tell a story? Express a feeling? Fulfill a game jam prompt? Make a game for a certain demographic?</s></li><li>🍏 <s><strong>The Core Loop.</strong> What's the essential activity that defines your game?</s></li><li>👩 <strong>The First Playable.</strong> Get stuff moving on screen ASAP. Code up your core loop so that your mom can play it.</li><li>🥞 <strong>The Horizontal Slice.</strong> Full gameplay. All game mechanics finalized, including progression and leveling mechanics.</li><li>🍰 <strong>The Vertical Slice.</strong> Full user experience with all game states. Includes menus, and win-lose conditions.</li><li>💅 <strong>Polish.</strong> Juice up your feedback. Add more content.</li><li>🎂 <strong>The Full Cake.</strong> The final game.</li></ol><p>Oh, and if you're using PICO-8, you might need to optimize tokens in between steps. 😛</p><p>These milestones will guide us through the rest of the tutorial series, so keep it in mind!</p><h2 id="design-your-game-loops-length">3. Design your game loop's length</h2><p>I think a <strong>good</strong> game is one where the total player time far exceeds the development time.</p><p>Why? Because players can replay your game over and over if it's genuinely fun. On the other hand, you only had to make the game once.</p><p>You get a lot more bang for your buck.</p><p>Part of that comes from the length of the higher-level game loop.</p><p>If you recall Pico Tennis, the <em>essential activity</em> is hitting the ball back and forth. But the higher-level <em>game</em> loop is the <em>rally</em>.</p><p>And in Pico Tennis, a rally lasts maybe a minute. This is important!</p><p>If you're designing for busy people who play games in pockets of time, maybe you want minute-long game loops. So players can play several rounds within the span of a coffee break.</p><p>(An interesting take: Jan Willem Nijman's <em>Minit</em> has game length in its name. Its game loop lasts exactly 60 seconds.)</p><blockquote><p><em>"Man, that's deep. Can I get some dog treats now?"</em></p><p><em>– Paraphrasing my dog, as she stares intently into my soul.</em></p></blockquote><p>Once you understand the idea of a core loop, you start to see them everywhere.</p><p>Take the game of life.</p><p>Not Conway's Game of Life! But actual day-to-day life.</p><p>The core loop of life is a <em>day</em>. And within those iterations lies a life <em>story</em>.</p><p>(From now on, maybe you'll think twice before creating a recurring event in Google Calendar.)</p><p>That's what we're aiming for. With a game's core loop, we tell a story.</p><p>What story do you want to tell?</p><p>In the next blog post, we'll discuss how to go from core loop to <a href="#define-project-milestones">First Playable</a>.</p><hr><h2>🏃‍♀️ Exercise</h2><p>Try it!</p><p>Head over to the PICO-8 BBS.

July 17, 2020 | https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexkondov.com/how-a-chrome-extension-broke-my-web-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a long break from personal projects, the situation around the virus inspired me to build something on the side again. I’ll spare you the details but I decided to build a new kind of job board that would let developers browse open positions based on the technologies they are interested in.</p>
<p>It’s a straight forward full-stack JavaScript application that uses React in the browser, Express on the server and Dynamo for storage. As much as I wanted to give Go, or Svelte a try I wanted to ship something fast. Learning a new technology on the go wasn’t compatible with that goal.</p>
<h2>The First Tests</h2>
<p>So I invested around 40-50 hours in an alpha version that had all the basic functionality in place. It wasn’t visually fascinating but it got the job done. I decided to Heroku for the Express app and Vercel for the React one.</p>
<p>Once the alpha version was ready, I entered a few commands in the terminal and I it deployed for the world to see. I sent it to a couple of my friends to get some feedback. They told me what they liked and what they didn’t and uncovered a few bugs along the way. I had plenty of work to do.</p>
<h2>“Probably nothing serious…”</h2>
<p>One of the bugs they discovered was quite unfortunate. The most important feature of the app was a rich, long form which had a lot of client side functionality. It has different fields, WYSIWYG editors, file uploads, drag and drop elements and what not. Turns out the whole form didn’t on Chrome.</p>
<p>The app was still in its infancy so I didn’t pay much attention to that. I had probably broken something small by accident just before deploying. I didn’t even open the console because I expected to see <code>cannot read property state of undefined</code> or something in those lines. You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Probably nothing serious. So did I think…</p>
<h2>The Plot Thickens</h2>
<p>A couple of weeks later I had made some improvements and fixes. I settled on a name, picked fonts and colors and gave the app a bit of personality. It was time to ship the next version. I tested locally and everything worked fine, including the form.</p>
<p>I run a few commands, type the domain name in the browser and there it is. Everything looks great. I send out the links again and wait for the responses, tapping my foot on the floor. The three dots signaling that someone is writing appeared in the chat box. A couple of seconds later the first message popped up - “The form doesn’t work again”.</p>
<p>That’s not right I tested multiple times. I checked the console and there weren’t even warnings. I didn’t want this to be a blocker for the test so I rolled my sleeves up and started digging. I opened the form on the production environment. Wrote a few letters in one of the text fields - and the form didn’t work.</p>
<p>There’s a small preview widget on the side that should be updated as you type but it wasn’t working. No errors in the console either. I run the app locally and everything works seamlessly. There’s something wrong with the production environment.</p>
<p>But how could that impact the page? I didn’t use any environment variables there, nothing platform specific either. I decided to check the behavior in different browsers. Started Firefox, went to the app and opened the form. It worked. Everything was updated as expected. I started Safari and checked the form there. Everything works again.</p>
<h2>We Knot Who, But We Don’t Know Why</h2>
<p>My friend experienced the same behavior - the bug was only in Chrome. I was completely puzzled. I never thought that Chrome of all browsers would be causing unexpected bugs. It’s usually the others that require special attention. At least I know where the problem is - time to dig.</p>
<p>I rolled my sleeves up and opened the dev tools. I wasn’t using any unsupported browser APIs so it’s not that. No application errors but in the Network tab I see that some of the requests are marked as blocked without a status code for the response. Huh?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those requests are for the JavaScript bundles that make the form page functional. The other pages are working fine, though. Their JS gets downloaded successfully. The one for the form, however, is marked as blocked without any message or any response.</p>
<p>My first thought was that a security rule in Chrome could be blocking the files for some reason. I did some reading around cookies, CORS, checked the configuration in Vercel but found no leads there. I scoured the web (and by that I mean Stack Overflow), searched for different phrases and problems that could give me some insight into what is happening.</p>
<p>No thread, or documentation page held any answers for me.</p>
<h2>On The Verge Of Desperation</h2>
<p>What I thought would be a trivial problem related to a missing check in JavaScript turned out to be a massive blocker. I can’t ship the app without the form. If it was failing only in Safari I could live with it. But this is Chrome - everybody’s using it.</p>
<p>At this point I had already spend my Saturday afternoon with no success. The wise thing here would be to call it a day and go back tomorrow with a clean mind. But since I was so invested I pressed on and continued to jam random words related to the problem in the search bar.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Somehow I put the correct combination of words, the stars aligned and at the top of the list I saw a link. It still had the blue color of a page that I still hadn’t opened. It was a question on Stack Overflow, of course.</p>
<p>I had already opened around 10 such threads, all with similar names, but hope dies last. I click on the link, hold my breath and start digging through the comments. Most of the responses and ideas I had already tried, they were of no help. But as I was about to click the back button, my eye was caught by one of the responses lower on the list. </p>
<h2>A New Hope</h2>
<p>It had the meager 7 upvotes but it was worth the try. All it said was to check the Chrome extensions since one of them could be interfering with the network call. Up until this moment I hadn’t even thought about them. They have access to everything on the page but in my 6 years of web development I hadn’t experienced any problems because of an extension.</p>
<p>But at this point I couldn’t rule it out.</p>
<p>I once again examined the unfortunate bundle. They are all named with an identifier, followed by a hash and the file extension - <code>index</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>listing</code>, <code>advert</code>. The blocked one that was breaking the form page was the <code>advert</code> bundle. I looked at the name for a second. Then I looked at the line of extensions next to the address bar. I looked at the name again. Then back to the extensions. Oh no…</p>
<p>A small red icon on the extension bar caught my attention - the AdBlocker. Could this be it? I disabled the AdBlocker and lo and behold - the page was fully functional. My friend got the same result. Apparently because the file contained the word <strong>advert</strong> it was getting blocked by the extension.</p>
<p>Everyone that tested on Chrome experienced the problem with the form. That’s because that’s their default browser and they most likely have some ad blocking add-on. Once they switched to another browser which they didn’t use and had no extensions installed, everything would work.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect AdBlocker to be that unforgiving but as a person who is not that fond of ads, I should be careful what domain language I use in my applications.</p>
<h2>Live To Tell The Tale</h2>
<p>So, this is it. The result of a Saturday afternoon spent debugging obscure problems. After such a session you usually go out of the room with a stern look on your face. Walking like a veteran with all your knowledge and the things you’ve seen. Well, I can’t say I learned anything new but I’ll be really careful with how I name my files from now on.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was always interested in the RF world, the fact that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of invisible waves that carry information is intriguing. A lot has changed over the years, the technology advanced and today you can easily dive into the electromagnetic realm without fiddling with mountains of equipment and burning your pocket.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll explore using RTL-SDR to read live temperature and humidity stats from cheap 433.92Mhz modules, feeding them to InfluxDB using rtl_433, MQTT and Telegraf on a Raspberry Pi (but any Linux based device can work)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR</a></strong></p>
<p>The definition of SDR is “Software Defined Radio”, it’s a radio-communication system where instead of using components that were traditionally implemented in hardware - software is used, allowing greater flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>RTL-SDR is a high quality USB dongle (but relatively cheap at ~$25) that can be used to scan and receive radio signals from 500Khz (24Mhz for the device I used) up to 1.75Ghz. It was designed and built by the awesome dudes over at <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR.com</a> based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles. I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> kit which included two modular dipole antennas.</p>

<p>Almost any RF based wireless thermometer / humidity sensor is probably readable by <code>rtl_433</code>. Since we’re talking about cheap hardware you can’t really get any assurances, checking the RF frequency is probably enough - if it says 433.92Mhz, you are 99% good. I’ve used <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33006820989.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1b754c4dDEUyyf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my indoor sensor and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000872896502.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.419a4c4duApRRx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my outdoor, for monitoring my garden soil humidity level and outdoor temperature</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CubicSDR for MacOS</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an awesome free open-source software for SDR. It wasn’t easy finding one for MacOS, most of the commonly-used projects are made for Linux and Windows. It’s not really required for decoding 433.92Mhz signals, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and look on live RF, it’s pretty neat (and of course to test the device is actually working!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl_433</a></strong></p>
<p>An amazing project that can be used to decode a variety of RF-based devices on various frequencies (433.92 MHz, 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands). This is the software that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mosquitto</a></strong></p>
<p>Very simple MQTT server and client implementation, we’ll be using that as the output of rtl_433 and input of Telegraf to stream the metrics to a remote InfluxDB instance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Telegraf</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent for collecting and writing metrics. It will subscribe to our MQTT queue, parse and transmit the metrics to InfluxDB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-signal">Getting a signal</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-the-antennas">Connecting the antennas</h3>
<p>Let’s start by quickly testing our shiny RTL-SDR receiver, I’ve used the two short 5cm dipole telescopic antennas for this test, you should definitely read <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-our-new-dipole-antenna-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this great guide</a> that the awesome dudes over at rtl-sdr.com wrote on using the provided antennas. The antenna used is critical for getting high-quality signal in some cases. For our radio FM test any antenna will probably suffice, but if you want to receive <a href="http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">weather satellite signal running on 137Mhz</a>, you’ll have to be more specific.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve ended up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="listening-to-radio">Listening to radio</h3>
<p>Now you can connect the dongle to your usb port, launch CubicSDR, choose “Generic RTL2832U OEM” and hit “Start”, you can ignore the extra settings you see on the right for now. You should see a pretty moving signal heatmap, you can change the center frequency by hovering over it and tapping space (the key), I chose a local FM radio station that is broadcasting on 88Mhz (FM).</p>
<p>Now your bandwidth setting should be set to 200Khz, you should get a nice signal and when you hover your mouse over it the band will “encapsulate” the signal, click and you should start hearing radio!</p>
<h3 id="checking-frequency-43392mhz">Checking Frequency 433.92Mhz</h3>
<p>Let’s get ready to use <code>rtl_433</code> by looking at the frequency and making sure there are devices there. Usually they will transmit information in 30 second bursts, you can change the center frequency to 433.92Mhz and check that you see data. Near the end of the video above you can see the signal bursts when I switch to 433.92Mhz</p>

This post briefly covers each type and discusses the situations where you would use either one.</p><p>We'll cover some of the many tools you can use for Postgres backups in future posts.</p><h2>Logical Backups</h2><p>This form of backup is typically achieved by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html">translating all the data into a set of SQL commands and writing it into a single file</a>. This can then be fed to any database cluster to recreate everything. In your CLI, performing logical backups can be as easy as:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dump db_name </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for a single database, and:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>pg_dumpall </span><span>&gt;</span><span> file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>for an entire database cluster. Both the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html">pg_dump</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pg-dumpall.html">pg_dumpall</a> utilities have their respective additional options for you to choose from and set up your desired logical backup setting. Recovering from them is comparably as simple:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>psql -d db_name -f file_name.sql</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>Simpler and quicker way of performing backups</h4><p>As shown above, a single command is enough to perform a logical backup and another to recover from it. As a novice with databases, this would be an ideal and non-intimidating ensure that your database is backed up at all times.</p><h4>Migration between different major versions of Postgres</h4><p>If you are planning to migrate to a different major version of Postgres (for example, from Postgres 11 to Postgres 12), logical backups via <code>pg_dumpall</code> would surely be your <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">tool of choice</a>. This is mainly because internal data storage formats may differ between major versions. This is the basis of physical backups, eliminating it as an option when upgrading. We'll go deeper into migrations and how to perform them in another post.</p><h4>Backing up a single specific database</h4><p>With <code>pg_dump</code>, you can constantly back up a single, targeted database.</p><h2>Physical Backups</h2><p>Physical backups pertain to the actual set of files or file systems where your database data is stored. One option for physical backups involves <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-file.html">taking a snapshot</a> of your data files by making a copy of them.</p><h3>What is it good for?</h3><h4>More ideal for larger databases</h4><p>As your database grows to the size of a few gigabytes, backing it up through physical backups is more ideal than through logical backups. As explained <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-data-safety-and-continuous-protection#the-performance-impact-of-logical-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, over time, performing logical backups in large databases could lead to degraded performance for other queries. Given the long run time as well to successfully perform a logical backup on a large database, errors have a higher chance of occurring, making the eventual backup unusable.</p><h4>Achieving Point in Time Recovery</h4><p>Postgres also generates <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">Write Ahead Log</a> (WAL) files, which can be used together with a backed-up file system to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html">recover a database up to any chosen point in time</a>. When disaster strikes, this is one of the best options for recreating your database up to the point right before the unfortunate happens. This greatly minimizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/business-continuity/rpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</a> along the way. Even better, tools such as <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAL-G</a> are readily available to simplify the steps involved in setting this up.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all, logical and physical backups are generated differently from one another. Neither has an advantage over the other. Depending on your needs, each brings unique uses to the table:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Logical</th><th>Physical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Simpler way of getting started with backups.</td><td>Better way of handling backups for larger database clusters.</td></tr><tr><td>Using it to migrate between different major versions of Postgres.</td><td>Using it for Point in Time Recovery.</td></tr><tr><td>Having the option to back up a single database.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p><span>The word trust is a common theme in cybersecurity when it comes to network breaches, yet the idea of lack of trust is what’s highlighted in these breaches. A company’s feeling of safety and security can disappear in a nanosecond once their network has been infiltrated, and all control of networks and applications is lost. For all tech-forward organizations, the feeling of lost control becomes more universal with every new breach to hit the headlines.</span></p>
<p><span>While in some industries this scary feeling may be up and coming, in the network security landscape it is not a new phenomenon. Whether from malware, ransomware, or your classic unauthorized access network breach </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/news/the-capital-one-data-breach-how-crisis-could-have-been-averted/"><span>like we saw with Capital One</span></a><span>, zero optimism is entertained concerning the safety of companies and individuals from hackers. Awareness of one’s level of a vulnerability is a prerequisite to safety and enables one to take pragmatic steps to secure their data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Rethink the Approach for Network Security&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Until recently, the organization’s IT and security teams primarily focused all their security efforts on fighting off different attacks on the perimeter. While this was the right approach when everyone worked in the same office, times have changed. Due to COVID-19 accelerating the “work from anywhere” approach, we need to rethink network security strategies and pivot them around the user instead of where the network is based.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With more employees working outside the physical office, there is a quickly growing number of endpoints for hackers to attack. In most organizations, the typical employee uses multiple devices to do their daily job. Is each device secure? The answer is probably yes – but you can’t be certain. With each unsecured every device, organizations’ networks are taking an unnecessary risk. When networks are breached, the process of understanding where and how access was gained is not instant and by the time you have your answers, it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span>IT and security teams need to change their approach, and instead of solely emphasizing perimeter security, transform their employees’ permissions and access policies. One of the most common mistakes organizations make is trusting their users when it comes to authorized access. When you provide unrestricted access to any user or device in your network, you simply open the gates for your organization’s network to be breached.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once a user or organization is compromised, their credentials can easily be used to infiltrate the network, especially with different attacks. This presents the idea that organizations need to have better visibility when it comes to authorized user access to their network. So how can organizations trust their employees once again?</span></p>
<h2><span>Zero Trust Helping Us Trust Again&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Can we trust our employees once again, and reduce their responsibility and impact as guards of the organization’s network against hackers? I believe we can, as humans are meant to be trusted even though in many instances human error puts that trust in doubt. People aren’t perfect, we all make mistakes, but we must account for them proactively.</span></p>
<p><span>A common approach that has gained popularity over the past decade for secure network access is by implementing the <a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/zero-trust-security">Zero Trust model</a>. Zero Trust was </span><span>originally proposed by Forrester in 2010, with the motto </span><span>“never trust, always verify”. This is the idea that until the user can verify him or herself via authentication, they will not receive access to the network. </span><span>Adopting Zero Trust is not a specific product or architecture, instead, it’s taking a more modern approach of setting up organization-wide guidelines inside the company’s resources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By implementing the ZTNA model for secure network access, IT teams will have full control over who is granted access, enters and leaves the network at all times. For each network, resource or application, there should be a set of rules and policies in place enforced by the key elements of the Zero Trust model: multi-factor authentication, proper device management, limited privileged access and network segmentation using software-defined architecture.</span></p>
<h2><span>ZTNA The Approach Not the Model&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Organizations that take the right approach with ZTNA can erase the concept of trusting in their employees and won’t fear to grant access. To achieve secure network access inside your organization you will need to have the proper principles implemented and distributed throughout the company. Treat </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> as a manual for how organizations should strategize and “trust” their employees with the keys to the kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <section>
                <p>I learned how to build websites the old fashioned way: looking at website source code and trying to replicate the things I saw. I threw in the odd book for the stuff I couldn’t <em>see</em> (like PHP/MySQL), and I was on my way.</p>

<p>This was back in 1999, when we’d write things like <code>&lt;font size="4" color="#000000"&gt;</code> and DHTML was a <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>When CSS came along my approach to learning didn’t differ. But I <em>really</em> wish I’d taken the time to learn CSS properly: there was so much fundamental stuff I missed.</p>

<p>Here are some things I didn’t know that I wish I’d learned earlier.</p>

            </section>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
        
        
                        
<h2 id="block-inline-and-inline-block">Block, inline and inline-block</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>Even though I <em>knew</em> about these properties, I didn’t fully understand them for a long time.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>block</code> elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line (like a heading). We can apply vertical margin to these.</li>
<li><code>inline</code> elements expand horizontally just enough to contain their content (like <code>strong</code> or <code>em</code> elements). We <strong>cannot apply vertical margins to these</strong> and they should usually be placed inside a <code>block</code> element.</li>
<li><code>inline-block</code> elements are like <code>inline</code> elements, <strong>but you can apply vertical margins to these</strong> (making them useful for things like buttons).</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>block</code> elements have a blue border, <code>inline</code> elements have an orange background, and our <code>inline-block</code> element has a red border.</p>

                <p>Images <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Styling_with_CSS">being inline by default</a> isn’t a problem, but it can cause confusion when trying to position them or add vertical margins.</p>

<p>If your CSS reset doesn’t include this already, I’d suggest adding the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>img {
    display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will make their behaviour much more predictable. You might also want to add <code>max-width: 100%;</code> to stop them breaking out of their container, too.</p>

<h2 id="how-height-and-width-are-calculated">How height and width are calculated</h2> 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
            
                    <section>
                <p>By default, the width/height of a box is calculated by adding together the dimensions of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content area</li>
<li>Padding area</li>
<li>Border area</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t usually a problem for an element’s height: we’re usually not too bothered about how content reflows vertically. The problems usually occur when trying to calculate an element’s width, especially if there’s more than one element in a row.</p>

<p>If we had the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.some-class {
    width: 50%;
    padding: 2em;
    border: 0.1rem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The total calculated <code>width</code> for <code>.some-class</code> would be:</p>

<p><code>50% + 4em + 0.2rem</code></p>

<p>That’s because of a property called <code>box-sizing</code> which has a default value of <code>content-box</code>. This value means the <code>width</code> property <strong>applies to the content area</strong>: everything else is added on top of this.</p>

<p>We can change this for all elements with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Returning to our example, the element’s width would now apply to the <code>border</code>, so our element’s total <code>width</code> would be <code>50%</code>.</p>

<p>What happens to the <code>border</code> and <code>padding</code>? Those properties/values still apply, but they don’t affect the total <code>width</code> of the element: they sit within the defined area.</p>

<p>Check out this Codepen to see this in action:</p>

                    <p>We haven’t discussed <code>margin</code> here because <strong>margin is the space between elements</strong>. For that reason, it is never part of this calculation.</p>

                    <section>
                <p>If an element has no <code>background</code> or <code>border</code>, it can appear that <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> are the same. They are not!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code> is the space <strong>between</strong> elements</li>
<li><code>padding</code> is space <strong>inside</strong> an element</li>
</ul>

<p>That makes <code>padding</code> useful for elements that have a <code>background</code>. We often don’t want the content to be close to the edge of the element’s box and <code>padding</code> helps us achieve that.</p>

                <p>This has been the source of frustration for CSS newcomers for a long time. Rachel Andrew <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/07/margins-in-css/#margin-collapsing">describes the behaviour</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When margins collapse, they will combine so that the space between the two elements becomes the larger of the two margins. The smaller margin essentially ending up inside the larger one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we have two block elements with <code>margin-bottom: 1em</code> on one element and <code>margin-top: 1.5em</code> on the element directly below it, the total space between the two elements would be <code>1.5em</code>.</p>

<p>We can see that here:</p>

                <p>When two margins meet, the larger margin absorbs the smaller margin. If the margins are the same value, they absord each other.</p>

<p>As soon as we know this, <code>margin</code> calculations become easier. It might also change our approach to managing them, and that’s where something like <a href="https://cssfordesigners.com/articles/managing-vertical-margins-in-css">the Lobotomised Owl selector can be useful</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Margins don’t collapse when the parent element is set to <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code>.</p>

                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It’s no surprise therefore that the <strong>cascade</strong> is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.</p>

<p>Though we might be aware of how our own stylesheets interact with each other, we have to remember that there’s <strong>always a default browser stylesheet</strong>. This is loaded <em>before</em> any custom stylesheets, making it easy to redeclare existing values.</p>

<p>The declared styles vary by browser, but they’re the reason that, by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Headings have different sizes</li>
<li>Text is black</li>
<li>Lists have bullet points</li>
<li>Elements have any <code>display</code> property (such as <code>block</code> or <code>inline</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other things.</p>

<p>Even if a website only has a single stylesheet, that stylesheet will always be merged with the browser’s default styles.</p>

                <p>Using pixels (<code>px</code>) is tempting because they’re simple to understand: declare <code>font-size: 24px</code> and the text will be <code>24px</code>. But that won’t provide a great user experience, particularly for users who resize content at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html#Update02">the browser level</a> or zoom into content.</p>

<p>I started using <code>em</code> (and later <code>rem</code>) for font sizing early. It took much longer to feel comfortable using <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> for other things such as <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code> and <code>border</code>.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> is critical to making relative units manageable. For instance, we might use <code>em</code> for <code>@media</code> queries and vertical margins, but <code>rem</code> for consistent <code>border-width</code>.</p>

<p>The benefits of going all-in on relative sizing are well-worth the small adjustment in thinking that requires.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Snap Search completes one year today 🥳</p><p>To be absolutely correct, it’s been a year since Version 1.1.1 went live on the store, I’m not even sure when I started working on it – but I assume at least 1 week before release.</p><p>This has been an amazing journey. I’ve made many apps/websites/products before – but never have I been so committed to something for so long. I usually get ‘bored’ after releasing and barely hold on for a month or so.</p><p>I’m going to try to share as much as I can about the inception of the idea, the process, what I learnt, future plans and then some numbers 📈</p><p>BUT, before I start – if you don’t have Snap Search and you have an Android device – consider downloading it: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cybersky.snapsearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play Store</a>.</p> <h2>Why a Browser for Android??</h2><p>Building a browser for Android was never the plan. Snap Search did not start as a browser. The idea was born as a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snap-sarch/diidgminbhdappppdmgglehmdoeiaheg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">browser extension</a>. I’ve made many apps before, but it was the first time I was making an extension. I had so much fun making that, I literally just wanted to make an Android version of Snap Search because I wanted that thrill. The extension currently follows the exact same format:</p><ul><li>Select your website/search engine</li><li>Enter your search term</li><li>Results will show in Incognito Mode</li></ul><p>However, on Android I could do much more. Incognito mode alone is <span>not</span> safe for browsing. I went a step ahead and did a lot more on Android because it was technically possible for me.</p><h2>The Process ♺</h2><p>Honestly, I do not have any process. May be if I had one I’d make better stuff or may be this just works for me – I’m not sure and I doubt I’ll ever find out. I’m more of a build first guy than plan first guy. This is a comparison of what the first version looked vs what it looks like now:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png" alt="Home screen for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) v/s Now (right)</figcaption></figure><p>There were a couple of things I knew from the start about what I wanted this app to be and how I wanted it to be.</p><ol><li>I knew I wanted a Proxy Mode/VPN ability for those users who really wanted to be safe on the web. Doing so wasn’t going to be easy or cheap – and so I had to introduce a ‘Premium Mode’. Now, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/app-change-log/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 releases later</a> there are multiple <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://snapsearch.online/general/why-should-i-pay-for-premium-mode-of-snap-search/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reasons to buy a premium plan</a> for Snap Search.</li><li>The app should NEVER ask for permissions. No storage, no location, no gallery, no contacts – nothing. If any feature required it, I would have to find a way around it or Snap Search would just have to be a browser without it.</li><li>No ads on Snap Search. Personally, I hate ads.</li></ol><p>And so, I just kept building.</p><p>Most app updates involved introducing New Features and UI Improvements. I made myself understand a few things beforehand:</p><ul><li>It needs to look good or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to be unique or people won’t use it.</li><li>It needs to work as promised or people will hate it.</li></ul><p>I guess these are standard points for any application/platform/service. However, that doesn’t make it any less important. In fact, I made sure to remember the same every time I sat down to write code or work on the app.</p><h4>Deciding What To Do Next</h4><p>Have you heard of a concept called the “Writer’s Block”? I was scared I’d face something similar – like a “Developer’s Block” or “Maker’s Block”. After every update I’d sit down and think – Do I have anything to do for the next update?</p><p>I always had the option of just improving what is already there – which is a good thing to do obviously, but I wanted something new to add, whether it was a new feature or an update to the UI. The current browser is a result of just that. I didn’t think of the current design at the start, it came to look like this after changes again and again. The original browser had the standard options of:</p><ul><li>Close</li><li>Minimize</li><li>Copy URL</li><li>Share URL</li><li>Open URL using External Browser</li></ul><p>Today, the browser <strong>has over 26 actions one can do!</strong> Here’s the before version and now version of that:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png" alt="Browser for Snap Search before vs now" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-50x43.png 50w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1024x890.png 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-300x261.png 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-768x668.png 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1536x1336.png 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-2048x1781.png 2048w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1160/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1160x1009.png 1160w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_58/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-58x50.png 58w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_650/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-650x565.png 650w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1000/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-1000x870.png 1000w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_50/https://snapsearch.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-after-browser-50x43.png 50w"><figcaption>Before (left) vs Now (right)</figcaption></figure><h2>What I Learnt 📚</h2><p>There are 3 important, fundamental concepts one must be aware of. These apply to all walks of life though:</p><ul><li>Focus</li><li>Perseverance</li><li>Hard Work</li></ul><p>Only with a healthy mix of all 3 have I been able to build Snap Search and get it to where it is today. I admit, it is probably nowhere close to a general measurement of success, but I wouldn’t have even come this far if I hadn’t focused on making it better, persevered through all obstacles, and continued to work hard towards my goals.</p><p>Another important thing I learnt is people are willing to try new things. When you think of a browser, it’s actually a pretty saturated market on its own. You got Chrome, Firefox and Safari leading the pack. Brave and Edge are catching up and then on Android, there are thousands more. One would think building a Browser for Android isn’t a smart idea, and that this is going to be really difficult to get into. But it turns out not that difficult too.</p><h2>Future Plans 🕞</h2><p>iOS! That’s all I’m going to plan ahead for. Yes, bug fixes and performance improvements and all that too. I need to focus on the iOS version now. Building a Browser for Android was fun, building one for iOS is going to be a challenge for me though.</p><h2>Numbers 📈</h2><p>Let’s get into it.</p><ul><li>Monthly Active Unique Users: 6.2K</li><li>Total Downloads: 20,000+</li><li>Total revenue: $1.4K</li></ul><p>To be fair, most of the growth has come in the last 4-5 months. January – December 2020 report will probably be much much better than this one. Initial growth was very tough.</p><p>Thank you for reading such a long post. It’s really hard to describe a year long experience in words, specially when you’re still coming to terms with it yourself.

        <p>Science is facing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">reproducibility
crisis</a>. Poorly designed or
 implemented scientific software represent a major limitation in making
packages reusable and analyses reproducible. In this article, I’ll break down
good software engineering practices to six <em>hallmarks</em>. These hallmarks guide
researchers through improving their code quality, maximizing the utility and
impact of the software, and in the long run improve the perspective of
replication in science.</p>

<p>Adhering to these guidelines is one aspect of making your research <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR</a> (<strong>f</strong>indable, <strong>a</strong>ccessible, <strong>i</strong>nteroperable and <strong>r</strong>eusable).</p>

<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/hallmarks_annotated.png" alt="hallmarks"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: The Hallmarks of Good Scientific Software<sup id="fnref:hallmarks"><a href="#fn:hallmarks">1</a></sup>. The icons
 (except pipeline) are from <a href="https://fontawesome.io/">fontawesome</a>. The figure

 license.</p>

<p>These hallmarks focus on tools and habits which will help taking your software quality
to the next level. I assume that you are already familiar with the basics of 
<em>clean coding principles</em>, i.e. you format your code consistently, use sensible 
variable names, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep everything stupidly simple</a>. 
The importance of writing easy-to-read code cannot be overstated. 
A good starting point for learning how to write clean code is this <a href="http://stat405.had.co.nz/r-style.html">style guide for R</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/zedr/clean-code-python#introduction">clean-code-python</a> project.</p>

<p>Next, let’s distinguish between <em>software packages</em> and <em>data analysis reports</em>.
Both are pieces of software which are covered by the hallmarks – however, they
have slightly different priorities.  Software packages are a tool, or a
collection of tools which are created with the aim of being applied to different
datasets. A typical example would be a sequence aligner like
<a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">STAR</a>, or a library for single-cell RNA-seq
analysis like <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/">scanpy</a> or
<a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">Seurat</a>. The main goal of software packages is
<strong>reusability</strong>, defined by the ability to reuse the code for multiple datasets
and for diverse goals of data analysis.</p>

<p>In contrast, <em>data analysis reports</em> mostly build upon existing software
packages and are specifically adapted to produce interpretable results for a
certain dataset. The main goal of data analysis reports is <strong>reproducibility</strong>,
defined by the ability to reproduce the results when run in another computing
environment or in a later time point than when the report was written.  Yet, it
can often make sense to abstract a data analysis report into a reusable pipeline
which can be applied to other datasets.</p>

<p>The first four hallmarks apply to both software packages and data analysis
reports. (In fact, they apply to pretty much any kind of software):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use version control (<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>)</li>
  <li>Use automated testing and continuous integration (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub actions</a>)</li>
  <li>Containerize all dependencies (e.g. <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, <a href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">Singularity</a>)</li>
  <li>Write extensive, high-quality documentation (e.g. <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a>, <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to that, two more hallmarks apply to data analysis reports:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use automated reporting (e.g. <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>)</li>
  <li>Use a workflow manager (e.g. <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/">nextflow</a>, <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a>)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="use-version-control">Use version control</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_vc.png" alt="vc"></p>

<p>The first, and arguably the most important hallmark is to use
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a><sup id="fnref:vc-systems"><a href="#fn:vc-systems">2</a></sup>. It keeps track of all your code
changes, and allows you to share your code on public repositories such as
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a><sup id="fnref:github"><a href="#fn:github">3</a></sup>. <strong>Making the code publicly available and
easy to be modified by others is the first step towards making your project both
discoverable and reproducible.</strong></p>

<p>There are many benefits of using git and GitHub, for instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t need to worry about backups any more. Every version of your code you store in git can be restored at any time.</li>
  <li>It allows you to keep track of what you did (this is very useful when continuing on a project after several weeks of interruption).</li>
  <li>It allows you to synchronize changes across working environments (say laptop and server cluster) and between collaborators.</li>
  <li>GitHub provides an issue tracker and project management tools to keep track of bugs and suggestions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet, the most important aspect of using GitHub is to get people involved with your software. <br>
<strong>Communication is an essential part of the scientific process, and GitHub is the way to communicate about scientific 
software.</strong> It increases your visibility in the community and makes your software 
being discovered more easily. You can retrieve feedback in form of bug reports, feature
requests and code reviews. Others can directly contribute improvements in the form of
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a>. 
Finally, it enables you to browse other, well-engineered pieces of software and learn
from them by reading their code.</p>

<p><strong>Tool of choice:</strong> <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> in combination with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-automated-testing-and-continuous-integration">Use automated testing and continuous integration</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_testing.png" alt="testing"></p>

<p>Automated testing is an industry standard in software firms for <em>years</em>, but it
is terribly underused in most scientific software, particularly those developed
by single contributors such as students and contractors. Automated testing does
not only ensure that your software package works on other systems than yours or
that you don’t break old functionality while adding new one – <strong>it also
increases the likelihood that the results your software generates are actually
predictable, at least within the space of the input parameters that you can
test, and correct</strong>. The correctness of the software output is top priority for
scientific software.</p>

<p>The concept of automated testing is simple: for every piece of code you write,
you also write a <em>unit test</em> that calls the piece of code with some example
data, and validates that it produces the expected result.</p>

<p>Initially, this might seem like a waste of time, but it isn’t: it helps to to
<strong>find bugs early</strong>. As a result, it pays off and saves time in the long run.
Finding bugs early decreases the cost for fixing them. If you detect a bug
right after writing the function, you still have everything in your memory
and can likely fix it within minutes. If the bug is discovered by someone
else a few months later, it might take you hours or days to figure out the
problem, because you have to dig into the code again. There are excellent
packages for automated testing for virtually every programming language. The
most common ones are <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> for Python
and <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> for R. Moreover,
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> is a python
package implementing <a href="https://medium.com/criteo-labs/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237">property-based
testing</a>,
which holds the promise to facilitate writing tests while covering a larger
set of test cases.</p>

<p>Writing tests by itself is not helpful if they are not executed on a regular
basis. This is where <em>continuous integration</em> comes into place. Continuous
integration runs your tests every time you upload your code on e.g. GitHub and
notifies you if the tests fail. By combining continuous integration with a
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">branch-and-pull-request
workflow</a>, you ensure that the
code on your master branch is always fully tested. You are notified when tests
fail, therefore increasing the chance to fix bugs early and quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> and
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> 
for Python packages, <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">testthat</a> for R
packages. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> for continuous integration.</p>

<h2 id="containerize-dependencies">Containerize dependencies</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_container.png" alt="container"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>(Isaac Newton, 1675)</i></p>

<p>This is definitely true for scientific software. Most software packages and data
analyses would not be possible without giants like
<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a>,
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>,
<a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a> and many more domain-specific packages.
Unfortunately, complex dependencies make it hard to install and run your
software. They also hamper reproducibility of your analysis as different
versions might be incompatible or produce slightly different results. This
phenomenon is commonly referred to as the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency
hell</a>.</em></p>

<p>Therefore, it is vital to accurately declare all dependencies required for your
software to run, <strong>down to the exact version number</strong>.  The most reliable way of
doing so is to build a <em>container</em> with all software required to run your
software. That way, your package or analysis can be ran in exactly the same
software environment you have been using. Containers are one of the few ways to ensure
that your analysis can be ran in a few years from now<sup id="fnref:conda-reprod"><a href="#fn:conda-reprod">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For software packages (as opposed to data analysis reports) it is also
appropriate to declare the dependencies in the format of the corresponding
package manager. This could be a <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html">DESCRIPTION
file</a> for R, a <a href="https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependencies.html">setup.py
file</a> for
python, or a <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#source-section">conda
recipe</a>.
Arguably, the best option is to offer both: properly declared dependencies and a
container.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">Singularity</a> and
<a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> for data analyses.
<a href="https://bioconda.github.io/">Bioconda</a> or
<a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> for software packages.</p>

<h2 id="write-extensive-high-quality-documentation">Write extensive, high-quality documentation</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_docs.png" alt="docs"></p>

<p>Documentation is an essential part of each software. <strong>Without proper
documentation, the most elegant piece of software can be useless.</strong> As a rule of
thumb, the documentation should have at least as many lines as the source code.
Documentation helps users getting started with your software quickly and vastly
increases the potential userbase.</p>

<p>For software packages, good documentation consists, one the one hand, of a
documentation of the public interface (API). The API consists of all functions,
classes etc. which are exposed to the end user. The API documentation describes
the input parameters and results for each function.  On the other hand, the
documentation should comprise instructions on how to install the package and a
step-by-step tutorial teaching the user to apply the software to real-world
datasets.</p>

<p>For data analysis reports, it is best to mix the documentation with the code
(see <a href="#write-self-reporting-data-analyses">self-reporting analyses</a>). Moreover,
it is vital to provide step-by-step instructions on how to rerun the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Tools of choice</strong>: <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/">sphinx</a>
(Python/general purpose) and <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a> for R.</p>

<h2 id="write-self-reporting-data-analyses">Write self-reporting data-analyses</h2>
<p><img src="https://grst.github.io/assets/bioinformatics/brick_reporting.png" alt="notebooks"></p>

<p>It is common practice to run a few commands in an R shell to produce a plot and
then copy and paste it to a PowerPoint presentation. <strong>This is not only terrible
from a reproducibility perspective, it is also inefficient and error-prone.</strong> It
is inefficient, because you have to re-do the plot manually if you change your
preprocessing or get new data. It is error-prone, because you’ll forget to
update all plots and old (wrong) versions keep floating around.</p>

                    <p>Inferrd is built on proven technologies that allow us, as developers, to focus on making the experience great. You might think building a hosting platform is a lot of headaches, not anymore!</p><p>I have been wanting to build something similar to Inferrd for 2 years now, but I never had the tools to do so. That is until a few months ago.</p><p>Google recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>. It allows anyone to deploy containers in production really fast. The best part is the pricing: one only pays for the milliseconds that they use. The container becomes "alive" when a request comes in and "pauses" right after. From our experience, the cold starts are usually around 400ms.</p><h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2><p>In order to serve someone else's model we had to know for sure that the architecture would be robust and scalable. Reliability is our priority. </p><p>Today, Inferrd runs <em>misson-critical production workloads</em> flawlessly for customers, let's see how.</p><p>The architecture consists of 6 parts: </p><ul><li>The API (on Heroku)</li><li>The Front-End (on Netlify)</li><li>Cloud Run</li><li>Storage (Google Cloud Storage)</li><li>A Postgres Database (on Heroku)</li><li>A Redis Database (on Heroku)</li></ul><p>Here is a simplified schema of the full architecture (minus redis and postgres, which are in the Inferrd API box).</p><figure><img src="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 600w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.inferrd.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-5.59.22-PM.png 1458w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Inferrd.com's Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>This architecture is great for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Every part of it is either scalable or Serverless. 🚀</li><li>CloudRun isolates user's models so we don't have to.</li><li>It is very cheap to run. </li><li>It requires almost no maintenance.</li></ul><p>You might wonder, why do inference requests go through the API first, instead of going straight to Cloud Run. Well, it is a real pain to setup redirections through the Google API (the documentation is seriously laking). Moreover, this allows us to save metrics and logs about models without having to write custom code for every environment.</p><h2 id="environments">Environments</h2><p>Inferrd supports many environments out of the box:</p><ul><li>TensorFlow</li><li>Scikit</li><li>spaCy</li><li>Keras</li><li>others to come...</li></ul><p>We had to make it very easy to push new environments and update existing ones. Environments are basically a docker image with the most up to date version of the frameworks required and a Flask server.</p><p>Cloud Run takes those containers and instantiates them at scale behind a load balancer. That's it. Security and reliability is taking care off by Google Cloud.</p><h3 id="try-inferrd">Try Inferrd</h3><p>Did you enjoy this technical write up and would like to test Inferrd?

This is especially true if you’re trying to learn as much as you can in a short amount of time.&nbsp;</p><p>With the books on  dynamic programming by your side, you’ll be amazed by how much easier dynamic programming problems can become. Today, we’re going to talk about the top five books that can help you learn dynamic programming.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_8229"><p><h2>What Is Dynamic Programming?</h2></p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="57.21830985915493" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_12974"><div>

The term itself is a bit loaded, with <em>dynamic</em> being a broad word that can apply to many things. So really, what is dynamic programming?</p><p>First of all, the concept of <em>recursion</em> is a prerequisite to understanding dynamic programming. If you do not already have a foundation in data structures &amp; algorithms, I<a href="https://booksoncode.com/articles/data-structures-algorithms"> highly recommend studying Grokking Algorithms</a> first, which is the same book that introduced me to these concepts. </p><p>Simply put, <strong>dynamic programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems.</strong> <strong>This technique chunks the work into tiny pieces so that the same work is being performed over and over again.</strong> You may opt to use dynamic programming techniques in a coding interview or throughout your programming career.  </p><p>Dynamic programming caches values so that you don’t have to re-compute operations. This allows you to compute every value just once.</p><p>Great examples of problems you can solve with dynamic programming:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Calculating the Fibonacci sequence. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the amount of change you need to make up a dollar amount. For example, 32 cents USD is one quarter, one nickel, and two pennies. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the number of ways you can add or subtract an array of values to reach a target number. </p></li><li><p>Calculating the optimum combination of items you can include in a knapsack by the knapsack’s weight capacity.</p></li></ul><p>Dynamic programming isn’t best for all problems. In many instances, dynamic programming just can’t help us in the improvement of the runtime of a problem. If your program isn’t performing repeated work, no amount of caching will make any difference.</p><p>If you’re very new to the concept of dynamic programming or have never even heard of it before, don't worry. All of these books on dynamic programming explain the idea in the simplest terms.</p><h2>Overview of the Criteria For the Best Books on Dynamic Programming</h2></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="50.70422535211267" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594947342441_16112"><div>

That chapter also discusses its related concepts, such as optimal substructure and overlapping-sub problems. But, those books tend to lack complex examples showcasing dynamic programming in action.</p><p>Dynamic Programming for Coding Interviews takes a different approach. This book dedicates one chapter per concept under dynamic programming. While discussing the ideas, the author provides straightforward examples.

Me and Joanne in front of one of our four homemade Grommet backdrops that were featured in all of our early videos.</p></div>
<p>Late last month, my Grommet co-founder Joanne Domeniconi and I were fired. Our majority shareholder Ace Hardware made the call, as is their right. It happens when visions for a company diverge.</p>
<p>Joanne and I are sad to abandon our Citizen Commerce™ mission and not see Grommet through to becoming a household name. But we feel nothing but a great deal of pride when we reflect on the hundreds of careers we shaped, the more than 3,000 small businesses we accelerated, and the thousands of jobs we created. We grew to a meaningful scale: where we could legitimately move markets and create demand for previously unheard-of products and even create new product categories. No one had heard of brands like SodaStream, Fitbit, OtterBox, PopSockets, S’well, Bombas, SimpliSafe and Mrs. Meyers when we embraced and launched them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news one Grommet maker wrote, “<em>I have said it so many times it must sound like a broken record, but what you created was pure magic</em>!”&nbsp; For a small business with an innovative product, breaking through in a crowded consumer world is excruciatingly difficult. Each Grommet we launched benefited handsomely from our reputation, credibility, and gaining access to our 4M followers.&nbsp; I always saw being chosen as a Grommet as cutting two years of struggle out of their path. Many awesome companies would have died on the vine if it were not for Grommet.</p>

<p>We employed hundreds of the best and brightest.&nbsp; One of the current team members said, “<em>The Grommet has made an impression on me in many ways in the three years since I joined. I’ve worked for a number of small companies now, and while most of their founders have had “hustle” to spare, I have not encountered&nbsp;anyone else with your commitment to&nbsp;values.&nbsp;I did not choose a career path which automatically involves helping others (doctor, nonprofit, etc.), so it has been a comfort to work for someone who steers the ship with moral conviction</em>.”</p>

<p>Lynda Applegate, a Harvard Business School professor, wrote a popular case on The Grommet. Out of the thousands of potential case study subjects at her disposal she chose Grommet because she said we were the kind of business that could uniquely thrive in a <strong>modern</strong> economy—with a groundbreaking approach to creating value for multiple parties. Here’s a small slice of what that means to me: I believe that each person in a company is sacred and capable of leadership. When individuals are <strong>truly</strong> engaged toward a common purpose, powerful gains can be delivered for customers, suppliers, society, and the planet. It is then that a great business–measured in revenue and profits–can also be a great company.&nbsp; I was not interested in one without the other. This is what Lynda recognized.</p>
<p>I also hope our Grommet alums will be brave on the innovation front. As one of our investors John Landry told me, “If you aren’t the lead dog you are just sniffing someone else’s butt.”&nbsp; We originated the use of video in e-commerce. We were the first company to assign societal/personal values to the products we sold. While corporations today are scrambling to show they “care” about products from minority or queer or veteran entrepreneurs, or from social enterprises, or about American made sourcing—moves that I wholeheartedly applaud—I take pride that we sourced all of our products according to those kind of values from Day One.</p>

<p>It seems so basic, but we built a company whose people and products you could trust implicitly. If retail were not a catastrophic race to the bottom, “trustworthiness” would not be a distinctive competitive asset–but it was at The Grommet. And it was measurable. While most e-commerce companies find that dissatisfied customers return 15-25% of what is bought, our customers only returned 3% of Grommets. And these are products from totally unknown small businesses. 3%!! This is because we curated carefully and only launched products worth buying, from people worth supporting.</p>

Our investors Bruce and Bridgett Evans, Jill Preotle, and Peter Lynch hosted a progressive dinner for our whole team to enjoy.</p></div>
<p>As a CEO, I am proud that we defied the odds and built a large-scale business, and shepherded it successfully through two financial crises and a global pandemic. We also defied the odds in attracting visionary angel investors like Peter Lynch and Jill Preotle–in a world where women founders get 2.7% of the funding from venture capitalists.&nbsp; We navigated not just one, but two, strategic investors over seven years.&nbsp; A public company CFO friend told me after the first investment (from the wonderful Rakuten) “<em>I have bought many companies. It never works for the founders. You won’t last six months.</em>” Ha!&nbsp; Joanne and I are not quitters. And we not only defied the odds in scaling the business, but also remained friends and partners throughout. We came into the venture together and there is poetry in the fact that we left Grommet the same way. Joanne and I were always a package deal.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of sappy, but I will think back at Grommet under our leadership as a form of “Camelot” for our team, our Makers and ourselves. My greatest hope is that Grommet alums will go on to use the lessons of how a business can both do good and do well. I know Grommet team members will be contributory to–and demanding of–their future employers when it comes to both ethical and executional standards. We all certainly learned a valuable lesson that one cannot simultaneously grow and harvest the same company–you have to pick a lane.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: for some reason beyond my understanding, our amazing VP of Operations Jason McCarthy was also terminated. The company was on a fantastic 2020 trajectory with revenues up 50% over plan in May and 25% for the year. Jason was very, very central to that success—our business was extremely operationally intense. Jason is a dynamic leader whose teams will follow him anywhere. &nbsp;He was my go-to person for many things from brainstorming new initiatives to putting models and plans to an analytical or real-world test.&nbsp; At Grommet he had the broadest portfolio of responsibilities among all my reports, including Logistics, Inventory Planning, Account Management, Growth Services and Customer Support. &nbsp;He also founded and built our Wholesale business. &nbsp;Beyond all that he is a culture builder who earned deep respect and loyalty during his seven year+ tenure at Grommet, including mine of course. I will be very happy to introduce him to worthy employers and startup teams.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the day (and our run), while the future course of Grommet will not include its founders’ drive and hustle, or our moral and spiritual guidance, we are happy to have shown the way for individuals and companies to support small businesses, to celebrate&nbsp; the work of underrepresented entrepreneurs, to seek out quality products, and to honor trustworthy people.&nbsp; Grommet was the culmination of my life’s work—and Joanne’s. We share a deep satisfaction and priceless legacy with the many talented and committed individuals who made it all happen.&nbsp; I have no regrets.

July 16, 2020 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-python-client-now-supports-asyncio | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-python-client-now-supports-asyncio">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>With the increasing popularity of Python web frameworks supporting asynchronous I/O like <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a>, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1">soon in Django 3.1</a>, there has been a growing demand for native async I/O support in the Python Elasticsearch client.&nbsp; Async I/O is exciting because your application can use system resources efficiently compared to a traditional multi-threaded application, which leads to better performance on I/O-heavy workloads, like when serving a web application. </p> <p>The wait is over! Native async / await support is now available in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html">version 7.8.0 of the package</a>, alongside support for all the shiny new Elasticsearch 7.8 APIs. To follow along with the below examples you’ll need Python 3.6 or later installed locally and an Elasticsearch 7.x cluster running. </p> <p><strong><h2>Installing and using the Elasticsearch Python client</h2></strong></p><p>Install the package using the <code>[async]</code> extra to install an additional dependency, <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/">Aiohttp</a>, which is used to make HTTP requests to your Elasticsearch instances: </p> <pre>$ python -m pip install elasticsearch[async] </pre> <p>After being successfully installed, you can now access an async native Elasticsearch client from Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>To show async in action, I’ll demonstrate&nbsp;using <a href="https://ipython.org/">IPython</a> since an event loop is available right away, allowing me to call <code>await</code> from the REPL. I’ll connect to an Elasticsearch instance hosted in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/cloud">Elastic Cloud</a> using the <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/#connecting-via-cloud-id"><code>cloud_id</code> parameter</a> for this quick demonstration: </p> <pre>$ ipython 
In [1]: from elasticsearch import AsyncElasticsearch 
In [2]: es = AsyncElasticsearch( 
   ...:   cloud_id=”async-example:cGVla2Fib28h...”, 
   ...:   http_auth=(“elastic”, “changeme”) 
   ...: ) 
In [3]: es.info()                                                          
Out[3]: &lt;coroutine object info at 0x7f2a59bb6fc0&gt; 
In [4]: # Returns a coroutine! We need to use 'await'                        
In [5]: await es.info()

  },

} </pre> <p><strong>Success!</strong>&nbsp; </p> <p><strong><h2>Start taking advantage of async</h2></strong></p><p>There’s <a href="https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/async.html">additional documentation on the asynchronous client</a> including information on using bulk helpers with async, a section on common scenarios you may encounter, and an example async web application project integrating Elasticsearch and Elastic APM.&nbsp; </p> <p>And if you haven’t tried <a href="https://www.elastic.co/apm">Elastic APM</a> yet, spin up a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/service">free trial of Elasticsearch Service</a> today, instrument the APM Python agent, and make sure your application is spending its time where it should be. </p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about how the Python Elasticsearch client works, you can tune into the upcoming <a href="https://community.elastic.co/events/details/elastic-emea-virtual-presents-introduction-into-the-python-elasticsearch-client">Introduction into the Python Elasticsearch Client</a> webinar on August 5th that’ll include the basics, a discussion of the architecture, and lots of time for Q&amp;A.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

July 16, 2020 | https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        css-media-vars adds several --custom-css-variables, all namespaced with "--media-" and based on media queries, onto the HTML tag. These vars act as universal mixins for your CSS values. If the media query is true, your value will be used. If it's false, the var(..., fallback) will be used.</p><p>
        
        For example, there are several named breakpoints that respond to the width of the screen, such as <code>--media-lte-sm</code>.</p><p>
        
        In your CSS, if you want a value to only apply when the screen is less than or equal to the "small" breakpoint range, you mix it into your value:<br>
        <code>--my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;</code><br>
        From this point, you can use your variable anywhere and it will only be "2px" if the media query is true. Else, it uses the fallback you provide, like so:<br>
        <code>border: var(--my-small-value, 15px) solid green;</code><br>
        <img src="https://propjockey.github.io/css-media-vars/suchborder.gif" alt="Border changing size at 900px breakpoint"><br>
        Here's a link to the jsbin pictured in the gif: <a href="https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output">https://jsbin.com/giqedowale/edit?css,output</a></p><p>
        
        If you need multiple break points, all you have to do is mix a different breakpoint into another variable and use it in the first fallback:<br>
        <code>
          --my-small-value: var(--media-lte-sm) 2px;<br>
          --my-medium-value: var(--media-md) 15px;<br>
          border: var(--my-small-value, var(--my-medium-value, 30px)) solid green;<br>
        </code><br>
        In this case, because the small values are listed first, this approach is <b>mobile-first</b>! CSS Variables don't compile the fallback unless it's used (similar to the expected short-circuting of conditionals in JavaScript).</p><p>
        
        This is all vanilla CSS. No JS or build step is necessary.<br>
        The library is small and built on a CSS trick called "Space Toggle" discovered in the development of <a href="http://augmented-ui.com/">augmented-ui</a>. You can read more about Space Toggle in these tweets which contain links to JSBins you can explore further with:<br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1283596399196680192">Second Tweet, a simple demo</a><br>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/James0x57/status/1282303255826046977">First Tweet, an advanced demo</a></p><p>
        
        Browser support for CSS Variables is currently 94% globally according to <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">caniuse</a>.<br>
        Each of the --media-* vars are using the actual media query in CSS to switch them to the "true" state. Browser support depends on the feature but will always behave as if it's "false" if the media query isn't supported in the user's browser, such as <code>--media-prefers-light</code> which only recently gained traction.

<p>Usually I set up sites on VPS services like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-with-lamp-on-ubuntu-18-04">DigitalOcean</a>, but wanted to get better at producing quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable</a> proof of concepts. This will mean I focus on creating value, in this case content, instead of having to spend time on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/resource-center/tutorials/building-your-first-website/">one hundred and one other things</a>.</p>



<p>In this instance I’ve chosen WordPress’s $48/year plan, as I’m used to the platform and willing to forego some of the niceties I’m used to like <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-connect-to-your-website-via-ssh-and-why-youd-want-to">full control of the machine with SSH access</a>, FTP to upload custom files, <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/24-must-have-wordpress-plugins-for-business-websites/">plugins</a> and additional custom software.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect however that I’d be prevented from making minor adjustments to my site like changing the header colour, centring the site title, changing link colours or fixing spacing.</p>



<p>WordPress also prevent you from removing their “powered by WordPress” advert at the bottom of your site. Although I mind that less because it’s a generally good platform and I’d like to encourage other people to share things they learn, with WordPress remaining a great platform to start doing so.</p>



<p>Just don’t expect much control over how individual things look, or be ready to pay for their $300/year business plan to do so.</p>

                <p>Let’s talk tax! Taxes aren’t the most interesting of topics, but as a mass
exodus from San Francisco begins in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are
a whole bunch of people working at Silicon Valley tech companies who are going
to have to start dealing with them in much more depth.</p>

<p>In general, people expect that taxes will be complicated in the year that they
move. However, if you’re being granted equity, as most Silicon Valley employees
are, you might be surprised to discover that they will be complicated for much
longer.</p>

<p>If you choose to move internationally, rather than just interstate, this counts
for double. My partner and I — neither of us US citizens — moved from San
Francisco to Sydney three years ago, and have spent the last few years figuring
out our tax situation. We struggled a lot to find good guidance on any of this
online, so I’m going to take the time to document what we learned in a few
posts, so that I can make the path more well-trodden for the next person.</p>

<p>Although I’ve spent a lot of time learning about this, I’m not a tax
professional. If any of it sounds wrong to you, or if you have your own story to
share, please <a href="mailto:hello@karla.io">reach out</a>!</p>

<h3 id="trailing-tax-liabilities">📆Trailing tax liabilities</h3>
<p>Income taxes sound like they should be simple: at the end of a tax year, you pay
a percentage of the amount that you earned that year to the relevant tax agency.
In some countries, your employer collects these taxes as you earn them
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-as-you-earn_tax">PAYE/PAYG</a>), and you need
to think about them even less.</p>

<p>Equity complicates this situation. When you’re granted equity, you’re being
promised something of value. There’s a problem though: that equity might not yet
be liquid — it could have a vesting schedule, you might not have exercised it,
it could be in a private company… and if it’s not liquid, you probably
shouldn’t have to pay anything when it’s given to you. Many tax jurisdictions
handle this by choosing to tax you at a later point: rather than when the equity
is granted, instead taxing you when it vests, is exercised (in the case of
options), or is sold.</p>

<p>However, imagine you move tax jurisdictions between the date where you’re given
the equity, and the date on which you actually pay tax. The first jurisdiction
now has a problem: in their eyes, you earned that equity while you lived there,
and they only gave you a free pass on immediately paying tax on it through the
goodness of their hearts. When you eventually pay tax in the second tax
jurisdiction, they want a piece of that too.</p>

<p>This is a trailing tax liability.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, any time that you’re granted equity in one jurisdiction, but
only trigger a taxation event on it in another, the first jurisdiction is likely
to say that they also have taxation rights.</p>

<p>That first jurisdiction is said to have “source” taxation rights, because that’s
where the asset was sourced, while the second is said to have “residency”
taxation rights, i.e. the right to tax you because you are presently a resident.</p>

<h3 id="apportioning-income">💰Apportioning income</h3>
<p>Now presumably, if you worked in both jurisdictions between the point where you
were given the equity, and the point at which you pay tax, there’s some
percentage that each should be considered the source of.</p>

<p>Internationally, this apportionment is governed by pairwise tax treaties between
countries. These are typically based on the
<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page28">OECD model tax convention</a>,
which helpfully has an in-depth commentary on this exact point
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page329">Commentary on Article 15, 12.14</a>).
In short, unless otherwise agreed between two countries, income is allocated
based on the percentage of <em>workdays</em> spent in each jurisdiction, from the day
the equity was granted, to the day that it vested. Note that this percentage
will differ for each tranche, or part of a grant, that vests on a different day.</p>

<p>However, those treaties only apply at the country to country level, i.e. for
taxes levied federally. In addition to imposing federal taxes, the US also has
state taxes, and these are not governed by international tax treaties.</p>

<p>That allows states to take a different view of how to decide whether income
belongs to them, and in fact, they do. For restricted stock, California takes
the same view as the tax treaty, and considers the period from grant to
vest. However, for someone granted options in California, who is a non-resident
when they exercise those options, the source is calculated by the percentage of
workdays spent in California from grant to <em>exercise</em>, rather than to vest (per
the <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/1004.html">Equity-Based Compensation Guidelines</a>).</p>

<h3 id="residency-taxation">🏠Residency taxation</h3>
<p>But the tax doesn’t stop there! In addition to the source jurisdiction taxing
you for the percentage they believe is theirs, the jurisdiction in which you are
currently a resident will also want to tax you, typically on 100% of the
income you earn from an asset. This can lead to double taxation: residency
taxation means you need to pay tax on 100% of the income to your current tax
jurisdiction, but you also need to pay tax on some percentage of the income
(potentially up to 100% again) to the source jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Many tax agencies provide relief against this situation, in the form of tax
credits: if you’ve already had to pay tax in one location for the same event,
they won’t charge you again.</p>

<h3 id="worked-example">📔Worked example</h3>
<p>That’s a lot to take in, so let’s work through an example:</p>

<p>Let’s assume you were granted 1,000 non-qualified stock options (NSOs) with a
strike price of $1.00, on 2018-07-01, while a tax resident of California.
The options vest once a year for the next four years, in four equal tranches of
250.</p>

<p>(If you’re not familiar with options, an NSO gives you the right to purchase a
given company’s stock at a given price, regardless of its current market value.
In this case, the option would be valuable if the company’s stock price rose
above $1.00, because you could exercise your right to pay the company $1.00 for
a share, and then immediately sell that share at its market value, taking the
difference as a profit, and consequently, as income.)</p>

<p>About a year and a half later, on 2020-03-01, you move from California to
Melbourne, Australia. We can figure out the source of each of those tranches
like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Tranche</th>
      <th>Relevant work period</th>
      <th>Total workdays</th>

<p>Internationally, these percentages apply regardless of when you choose to
exercise those options, provided you do so after the date you move to Australia.
However, those options are also subject to taxation within California, and as
we’ve mentioned, the tax agency there believes in a different source percentage
scheme.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you don’t touch that equity until three years after your move,
on 2023-03-01, when you choose to exercise it all.</p>

<p>If we assume that once exercised, but not prior, your options become liquid
shares, you’ll be taxed by each of the US federally, California, and Australia
on the day you exercise. Taking just the 2020-07-01 tranche into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 83% of the income in the US,</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 36% of the income in California, and</li>
  <li>you’ll be taxed on 100% of the income in Australia, which has residency
 taxation rights. However, you’ll be able to get tax credits for tax paid
 in the US federally on the 83% of the income considered to be foreign-sourced.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that despite having lived outside of the US and California for 3
years on the date of exercise, you’ll still need to declare US and Californian
income, and pay tax in those jurisdictions. If you’d moved interstate within the
US, you’d still be filing federal returns regardless, but you’d also be required
to file a Californian return that year.</p>

<h3 id="gotchas">🔎Gotchas</h3>
<p>Note that there’s a big gotcha in the worked example above: you only got to
claim tax credits in Australia for the 83% income that the US taxed federally,
but not for the 36% that California taxed.</p>

<p>That’s because, as previously mentioned, the tax treaties only operate between
pairs of countries, not between one country and a state in the other. This
means it’s quite possible that you won’t be able to get tax credits for taxes
paid to a state of another country, and will end up double taxed on part of your
income.</p>

<p>For the worked example, Australia specifically
<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/pdf/pbr/it2507.pdf">does consider Californian taxes to be a part of the US income tax system</a>,
so you would in actuality be allowed to claim credits for taxes paid there,
though the same isn’t true in all other countries.</p>

<h3 id="investments">📈Investments</h3>
<p>You might wonder what happens when you eventually sell the shares you get as
a result of exercising – will those also be subject to US or Californian
taxes? While I don’t have personal experience with this situation, the OECD
tax treaty commentary clarifies this point in
(<a href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2017_mtc_cond-2017-en#page326">Article 15, 12.2</a>):
only the income effectively connected to your employment is taxable in the
source jurisdiction. Since exercising is considered to be an investment
decision, any increase in value of the share resulting from the exercise of an
option is considered to be a capital gain, and is therefore <em>not</em> taxable by the
source jurisdiction. Helpfully, this is also California’s interpretation, giving
us some much-needed consistency between what happens internationally and within
California.</p>

<p>If instead you had chosen to exercise prior to moving, the OECD commentary
states that when you moved the asset would be treated as being capital in
nature, and so would only be taxable in your jurisdiction of residence at sale.
However, several countries, including the US …</p></div></section></article></div></section></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ae19b0af531587e4c712"><div><p>With schools and daycares closed for over 3 months, children have been feeling painfully lonely. Families have struggled to find ways to help kids connect and are deeply concerned about their children’s well being - as well as how they’ll develop healthy social-emotional skills during this time.&nbsp;</p><p>Many families are rightfully skeptical about the ability of their children to develop meaningful social connections online.&nbsp;</p><p>However, a lot of the problem is that <em>we’ve been trying to do online experiences in the same way we’ve been doing in-person interactions</em>. Online meetings are an entirely different medium than in-person ones and we need to get creative about the way we relate online and offline to make this work for our kids.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Here are a few ways you can develop your children’s social skills in-person during the pandemic:</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Forming a healthy attachment with your own child can go a long way </strong>in helping them develop meaningful connections with other kids down the road. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gentleparentsunite/">Gentle Parents Unite</a> is a wonderful group of parent coaches and engaged families who can help give you advice on how to connect with your child. Here are “<a href="https://childdevelopmentinfo.com/family-building/7-ways-to-connect-with-your-children">Seven ways to connect with your children</a>” from the Child Life Institute.&nbsp; </p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Nurturing relationships between siblings is a great way help children learn to socialize. </strong>We can use this time of quarantine to help our kids develop better relationships with each other so they can continue to support each other and be friends as adults, a time when they’ll maybe need each other most. The Mayo Clinic has some good advice on addressing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/sibling-rivalry/art-20046568">sibling rivalry</a> to get you started.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Quality socialization can happen with one other child</strong>. It doesn’t have to happen in a huge group. If your child is really craving in-person interaction, you can consider making friends with one other family who is also practicing social distancing. Doing this relationship well will help children function well in a group as well. Consider encouraging playdates with your child’s best friend from school or class. You can also reach out to local parenting groups on Facebook or Meetup to make online friends and set up playdates. Children often connect best around shared interests so talking about your child’s interests when you put the call out to friends - or finding online camps or classes can be a good way to make friends. If your child gravitated to a friend in their online camp or class, consider contacting the camp director to make an introduction to their parents and request an online playdate.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>A nature hike wearing masks in a small group can be a good way to socialize. </strong>Consider going on a nature hike in a small group of 3-4 families where all kids and parents wear masks and families stay six feet apart on the trail, but definitely make sure you wear masks and that your children do too. Masks really do help stop the spread of Covid-19. While children don’t often exhibit symptoms of COVID, they most certainly carry it just as much as adults and can pass it along to more vulnerable family members. You can learn more about how <a href="https://abc7news.com/education/how-should-schools-reopen-expert-suggests-wearing-mask-is-safest-thing-to-do/6317558/">masks help stop the spread here.</a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><strong>It’s also possible to create joyful social experiences for kids online. Here are a few ideas to get you started.</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Set up your child’s online environment to encourage movement. </strong>Being online doesn’t mean you have to sit still. Set up your child’s space so they can bounce around, wiggle, dance and play while the screen is on.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Encourage kids to do projects together online with one other child or a small group. </strong>Doing a project together online can be more enriching than just sitting and talking or listening to a lecture<strong>. </strong>Even if kids don’t talk during the project. While I bet you already have a lot of great ideas for arts and crafts, cooking or other activities, there are a lot of websites that can give you wonderful ideas for projects: <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">Teachers Pay Teachers</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube,</a> or <a href="https://www.enrichmentactivities.org/">The Ultimate Guide to Staying at Home With Kids</a>.&nbsp; I also encourage you to reach out to local parenting groups or learning communities like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/445786889466638/">Amazing Educational Resources </a>or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/seahomeschoolers">SEA homeschoolers</a> to ask for ideas for great projects that kids in your child’s age group can do online together.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Get creative. </strong>If we stop trying to do online activities the way we do in persons ones, kids can have a lot of fun online, making friends and developing social skills.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><strong>I asked families to share some of their best ideas for connecting online</strong>. <strong>Here’s what they said worked well for them</strong>.</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Virtual playdates:</strong> One dad told me that his daughter spends an hour a day with her best friend on skype: playing, chatting and dancing around. The parents were thrilled after 3 months to give the girls a chance to get together for an in-person bike ride. After the bike ride, the father asked his daughter, “weren’t you so excited to see your friend in person?” To which the daughter replied, “what are you talking about? I see her every day!?”</p></li><li><p><strong>Tutoring and mentorship: </strong>Many sites like <a href="https://coda.io/@schoolhouse/welcome">Khan Academy</a> and<a href="https://schoolclosures.org/"> Schoolclosures.org</a> are offering free tutoring to families during the pandemic. One mom I spoke to told me that her six year old spends 2 hours a day talking to his physics teacher across the country.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Try online classes and activities: </strong>As more and more families and teachers have started to innovate with online socialization. More and better social opportunities for kids have started to emerge online. Khan App Kids is giving free camps this summer. <a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a> and <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/">HiSawyer</a> offer great classes as well.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Find a virtual sitter with special talents:</strong> One mom posted an ad on sittercity looking for a “ virtual sitter” and received hundreds of applications. It is only an hour at a time and she has 4 rotating sitters that all have different skills ( singer, actress, dancer etc.) She mini interviews with them and her daughter and she now looks forward to her “play date” with her sitters. They sing, dance, talk, play games. They’re all pretty young girls 18-20 and love this gig as they’re home for school.</p></li></ul></ul><div><p>If you’re trying to help your child make a friend or learn more about how to connect meaningfully online, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.modulo.app/contact" target="_blank">reach out</a>. We’re always happy to find ways to help and support families in building meaningful social connections for kids.&nbsp;We also run a facilitated online community for kids to connect and build meaningful social connections. You can learn more about <a href="https://www.modulo.app/subscription/kidsclub">Kids Club</a> here. </p><p>This isn’t an easy time for anyone. There are aspects of being physically together in a large group, the spontaneity, the warmth, the sense of connction and all the good vibes that just can’t be replicated online. I for one, can not wait to spending quality time with my extended family and friends.  But in the meanwhile, there are ways we can make it more joyful for everyone by nurturing connections at home and virtually.  By embracing this new reality, we can make it easier for all.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><em>“Reading books is the real-life version of collecting mushrooms in Super Mario.”&nbsp;—</em> Random guy on Twitter</p>



<p>Ever walk down the aisles of a bookstore and feel an intense FOMO on all the books you want to read? You realize that time on Earth is finite, and when you combine the fact that you need to sleep, travel, work, and socialize, there is just no possible way to read everything you want.</p>



<p>To save time and stress, it helps to implement filters on what you read. Some effective filters include:</p>



<ul><li>Taking recommendations from friends and trusted sources.</li><li>Seeing what’s popular and gravitating towards those books.</li><li>Seeing what’s popular and gravitating away from those books.</li><li>Research your heroes and mentors to see which books influenced them the most.</li><li>Choose only books that you, in 30 years, will be glad you have read.</li><li>Prioritize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">the Lindy Effect</a>–books that have been around for a long time, and are likely to stick around long into the future. </li></ul>



<p>I have prioritized the Lindy Effect more in my selection process over recent years. Older books have survived the test of time for a reason. But with modern reading trends seemingly headed towards older books, it can be easy to overlook the many gems that have been published in the 21st century. </p>



<h3>Modern Books That Revolutionized My Life</h3>



<p>I’ve decided to put together a list of modern books (<a href="https://joebalcom.blog/bookshelf/">which you can find more of here</a>) that have revolutionized my life. Books that have drastically changed my views, influenced my thinking, and formed my philosophy over the last 10-15 years. </p>



<p>I’ve broken down this list into sections you might find in your typical bookstore. For each section, I’ve chosen the book that has defined that particular topic in my own life.  These books will certainly give you an idea of why I do what I do, and why I write what I write.</p>



<p>From influence to leadership, from travel to psychedelics, this list is bound to have something for you:</p>







<h3>Biography: <a href="https://amzn.to/2SvO6jn"><span>Benjamin Franklin</span></a> by Walter Isaacson</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2CHgJFk"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4pdrIVKL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4pdrIVKL._SX328_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Quite possibly my favorite historical figure ever. There is so much to learn from this book, not just about the usual textbook stuff you’ve learned in school, but about his struggles, his humorous personality and everything in between. Ben Franklin is someone we should all strive to emulate. And if you’ve never read a Walter Isaacson book, you are sorely missing out on greatness!</p>

<h3>Entrepreneurship: <a href="https://amzn.to/2YtkxTB"><span>The 4-Hour Workweek</span></a> by Tim Ferriss</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3fI0rec"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW97ndkvL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81qW97ndkvL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This is what <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/11/view-quake-read.html">Tyler Cowen</a> would call a “quake book.” One that just changes everything about how you think about and approach life. This book is all about taking your destiny into your own hands, and is one that has had a huge influence on me. The version I read had many outdated (circa 2007) resources, but the message still resonates to this day. Of course, <a href="https://amzn.to/3fI0rec">here is the updated version</a>.</p>

<p>What a fun book this was. “You” are the main character and the story takes you through different phases of your life, from a poor kid from an unnamed south Asian country (resembles Pakistan) to pursuing the successes and navigating the pitfalls of love and business. I don’t read much fiction, but this was an excellent book!</p>

<h3>Leadership: <a href="https://amzn.to/2WlIIAL"><span>Extreme Ownership</span></a> by Jocko Willink</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3jbhRBX"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lJf8ayabL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lJf8ayabL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This was the key book that helped me <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/08/destiny/">become a restaurant manager, and lead an organization of 100+ employees</a>. The lesson: if you are to achieve anything of significance in life, if you are to gain trust of subordinates, higher-ups, strangers, friends, or loved ones, you MUST hold yourself accountable for everything that happens. You must take ownership in everything you do. It is the only way.</p>

<h3>Mind/Psychology: <a href="https://amzn.to/2Wlo2Zz"><span>How to Change Your Mind</span></a> by Michael Pollan</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/3j737Eh"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81z1rs6gVlL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>This one has a special place in my life. Having experienced the effects that various mental illnesses have on some of my closest family and friends, I had always thought that these were things we just had to live with. But Pollan’s book sheds light on the world of psychedelics and their use as a possible treatment and maybe even cure for some illnesses. It has since lit a fire under me to learn everything I can about this largely unknown realm. </p>

<h3>Travel: <a href="https://amzn.to/3c0vRdz"><span>Vagabonding</span></a> by Rolf Potts</h3>

<p>Speaking of lighting fires, this book set off a personal obsession for me over the last nine years. Traveling was never really a part of my life until I was 21. It was this book that opened my mind to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/15/road-trip/">travel as a lifestyle</a>, not just something someone does once a year on vacation.</p>

<h3>Philosophical/Spiritual: <a href="https://amzn.to/2KXUV9f"><span>Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It</span></a> by Kamal Ravikant</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ox36LE"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517gFULQCeL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517gFULQCeL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Although there are many more qualified book candidates in this category, Love Yourself was a recent revelation of mine in a time of personal crisis. We all have moments when we don’t quite love ourselves. No matter what situation you find yourself in, this book will help. It is a short read. I read it over a three day trip and it changed my appreciation for myself in a non-trivial way. Kamal also wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/2YsKgvd"><span>Rebirth</span></a>, another amazing book of his that I discuss further in this <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/03/forcing-function/"><span>blog post</span></a>.</p>

<h3>Physical: <a href="https://amzn.to/2WqIl85"><span>The 4-Hour Body</span></a> by Tim Ferriss</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/393TWj0"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f6XL1RyZL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Read for hours to learn the lessons others took years to learn." width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41f6XL1RyZL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>The only author who takes up two spots on my list, Tim Ferriss is a beast. This book shaped the approach I take to physical health forever. Using tools, tips, and tactics in the realms of diet, exercise, and supplementation, this is a great book if you’re looking to kick-start a physical change in your life. I’ve lost 50+ lbs of fat combined using the methods in this book. It simply works.</p>

<h3>Productivity: <a href="https://amzn.to/3d76NBO"><span>Deep Work</span></a> by Cal Newport</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2B5IYgu"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kzUUHhMTL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Productivity" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kzUUHhMTL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Deep work is an underrated concept. We humans now have attention span of a squirrel. Combine that with the up-to-the-minute need for new information, incessant infiltration of our digital lives by email, and the screaming kid or the barking dog, and we have little ability to get anything of consequence done in an efficient manner. The concepts in this book have allowed me to focus more for longer stretches of time, and I believe this blog and other projects I am currently working on are a direct result.</p>

<h3>Social: <a href="https://amzn.to/3dfxLHN"><span>Influence</span></a> by Robert Cialdini</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/2Cm1VvX"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710glEdDlfL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Social" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710glEdDlfL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>I’m gonna cheat a little here, because this book was originally published in the last century. However, this is by far the best book out there on the topic of persuasion. Influence is everywhere we look. It is how things get done. Even if you are not aware of its presence, it’s power is affecting you at this very moment. Which is why this book has had a massive influence on me. Learn how to influence, and learn how you are influenced, and you’ll never see life (or commercials on Nickelodeon) the same way.</p>

<h3>Wealth &amp; Money: <a href="https://amzn.to/3b2D6R0"><span>Money: Master the Game</span></a> by Tony Robbins</h3>



<div><figure><a href="https://amzn.to/30mRfFk"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2aSRQqGL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;ssl=1" alt="Wealth &amp; Money" width="350" height="530" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81x2aSRQqGL.jpg?resize=350%2C530&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></figure></div>



<p>Most of the basic concepts of money and how to use it, save it, and invest it, I learned from this book. Tony talks to a plethora of experts and hedge fund managers to discuss all the things we should know (and all the things they don’t teach us in school) about money. Tony Robbins is a master with words, and truly does an amazing job in this book through his synthesis of ideas from the worlds best financial minds.</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope you enjoyed this list, and I hope you decide to pick up a few of these for your own personal growth journey! These books were, in no small part, responsible for shaping who I am today and the success I’ve had so far in my life. I have no doubt that they will do the same for you.</p>



<p>To get the most out of reading, you don’t have to read every book that piques your interest. You don’t even have to love the process of reading! Look for books, authors, and topics you love. </p>



<p>Reading the right books will change your life for the better. But don’t make it a chore. Read what you love until you love to read. And have fun with it!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Recently I’ve switched back to Linux, after having used macOS for the past 9 years.
While I was generally happy with my overall macOS experience, I was also disappointed
that Emacs simply didn’t work as well there, as it does on Linux for various reasons.</p>

<p>When I was a Linux user I’d always run Emacs as a daemon (server) and I’d
connect this daemon from multiple instances of <code>emacsclient</code>. This was both
elegant and efficient - my clients started instantly and shared access to
everything that was running on the daemon instance. While this was doable to
some extent in macOS, it never worked quite as well for me, and I abandoned that
workflow eventually. Now, however, I’m back! Time to revive the workflow!</p>

<p>Historically I ran the Emacs daemon by adding something like this to my shell init (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>''</span>
<span>alias </span><span>e</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient --tty'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The magic is in the first line - leaving <code>ALTERNATE_EDITOR</code> blank.
That way the first time I ran <code>emacsclient</code> it’d start an Emacs daemon and
connect to it. Many people preferred to make the daemon a “proper” service that
they can start, restart and monitor, but this felt like an overkill to me. I’ve
noticed, however, that Emacs 26.1 bundles a <code>systemd</code> unit, so it’s now trivial
to control your Emacs daemon with <code>systemd</code>. It all boils down to running this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ systemctl --user enable --now emacs
</code></pre>

<p>Run this command with your regular user (or whatever user account you want to be running Emacs). Don’t run it as <code>root</code>, though!
You’ll get a message that the unit file was copied to <code>/usr/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service</code> and you can examine it if you’re curious:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Emacs text editor
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --fg-daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/keyring/ssh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>At this point your Emacs daemon is up and you can connect to it using both
terminal clients (<code>emacsclient -t</code>) and GUI clients (<code>emacsclient -c</code>). You
might also want to create some desktop icon that runs <code>emacsclient -c</code>, instead
of <code>emacs</code>.  You might also want to set both <code>EDITOR</code> and <code>VISUAL</code> to
<code>emacsclient -t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>EDITOR</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span>export </span><span>VISUAL</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I typically add two more aliases just to be on the safe side:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>alias </span><span>vi</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
<span>alias </span><span>vim</span><span>=</span><span>'emacsclient -t'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that when you’re running Emacs in this manner it
won’t read your user environment variables (at least not those coming from your
<code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code>). That’s why it’s a good idea to install the
popular package
<a href="https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell">exec-path-from-shell</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use one of <code>systemd</code>’s own mechanisms for setting environment variables - e.g. <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/environment.d.html">environment.d</a>.
The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux Wiki</a> has
a few <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#Environment_variables">good examples</a> of
using <code>environment.d</code> and also mentions other approaches that you can consider.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for you today. I hope you’ve learned something useful. In parentheses we trust!</p>

<p>After six weeks of work since <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-3">Alpha 3</a>, we are happy to
            announce the immediate release of EdgeDB 1.0 Alpha 4 “Barnard’s Star”. You
            can <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">download</a> it in a number of ways or try it out in our
            <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install anything.</p>

<p>This time around we focused on making the database more intuitive from
            both the server and the client perspective.  While there’s fewer changes
            due to our newly adopted six-week release cycle, we’re able to deliver them
            to you much quicker.  Let’s go through some highlights of the release!</p>
<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database based on
            PostgreSQL.  The project aims to give developers and data engineers a highly
            efficient and productive database technology while addressing the
            <a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a> and its surrounding ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>high-level data model and type system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a powerful, expressive and extensible query language that allows working
                    with complex data relationships easily;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first-class support for schema migrations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for converting arbitrary strictly typed data to and from JSON
                    via a simple cast operator;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>out-of-the-box interoperability via REST and GraphQL.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improved-usability-of-server-instance-maintenance"><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0-alpha-4-barnard-s-star#improved-usability-of-server-instance-maintenance"><svg width="35" height="35" viewBox="0 0 35 35"><path d="M2.694 6.631h19.085v3.961h-1.944V8.574H4.636v10.962h15.199V17.52h1.944v3.96H2.694V6.632zM13.3 13.085h19.086v14.848H13.3v-3.962h1.942v2.019h15.2V15.027h-15.2v2.017H13.3v-3.96z" fill="#047CFF"></path></svg></a>Improved Usability of Server Instance Maintenance</h2>
<p>One of the ways in which we’re setting EdgeDB apart from previous generation
                databases is the focus on usability of day-to-day tasks.  One particularly
                gnarly topic is maintenance of server instances: installing a new version,
                upgrading existing databases to a new version, setting up an instance to
                run properly as a service daemon, accessing logs, and so on.  It gets
                especially tricky when multiple operating systems provide their own unique
                ways to achieve those tasks.  Even better if the user needs to keep
                a few versions running concurrently.</p>
<p>We looked at how efficient <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> is in ensuring the user
                has a fully functional up-to-date installation of the Rust toolchain,
                and got inspired: what if we can provide <em>this</em> experience for a database?</p>
<p>The end result is the new <code>edgedb server</code> group of commands that ships with
                the default EdgeDB CLI. Its design was planned and discussed as part of an
                RFC process which, as the rest of EdgeDB, is open. <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1001-edgedb-server-control.rst">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>The most visible change related to <code>edgedb server</code> is that it is now
                the new recommended way to install EdgeDB servers on your operating
                system.  See <code>edgedb server install --help</code> for details.  The
                underlying installer will still use your operating system’s package
                manager but it provides instance configuration in ways that allow for
                running multiple EdgeDB versions concurrently on one machine.  And with
                <code>edgedb server upgrade</code> you can easily bump the version on an existing
                installation without having to redo configuration or dump and restore
                data manually.</p>
<p>And how do you get the new CLI tool on your machine?  We redesigned the
                <a href="https://edgedb.com/download">Download</a> page to be more inviting, providing a new
                cross-platform way to install EdgeDB with a single-liner in the terminal.
                And if you’re a macOS user, you might want to use our new Homebrew tap!</p>

<div id="javascript-bindings-got-more-powerful">

<p>We supercharged <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/">edgedb-js</a>, our JavaScript client for EdgeDB,
                with an efficient <a href="https://edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/usage#connection-pools">connection pooling</a> implementation. This
                allows users write faster applications with less code.</p>

<p>We also thought hard about the API and decided that <code>fetch*()</code> function
                names don’t really sound very natural when you’re trying to insert or update
                data. We renamed them to <code>query*()</code> which is the obvious name in hindsight:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>example</span><span>(</span>conn<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  <span>await</span> conn<span>.</span><span>query</span><span>(</span><span><span>`
    INSERT User {
      name := 'Alice'
    }
  `</span></span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></span></span></pre>
<p>The change actually originated in our Python client and this is <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python/issues/51">where the
                    change was discussed</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the usability sprint we made <code>DESCRIBE</code> better.  When
                describing objects, it will now list all matches for the specified name
                if available.  This is particularly interesting in case of user functions

<p><code>DESCRIBE ROLES</code> and <code>DESCRIBE SYSTEM CONFIG</code> in turn allow you to

<p>The back-end implementation for the much improved workflow for migrations

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Your resume will be the first point of contact with the company you’re applying for. It’s absolutely <strong>crucial</strong> that your resume creates a good first impression. The receiver of your resume can either be a recruiter, or someone directly from the company. Either way, the entire goal of your resume is to get the recruiter or company to advance you to the next step in the hiring process.</p> <h2 id="adapt-to-the-position">Adapt to the position</h2> <p>There’s a lot of stuff that goes into creating a compelling resume, but most importantly: <strong>you have to adapt your resume to the job you’re applying for</strong>. One of the most common mistakes is to send the same resume to 500 companies and hope to hear back - this doesn’t work. Instead, you need to personalize your resume to match the job spec. If you’re applying for a React job, put your React projects on top of your project list. If you’re applying for a data science job, highlight your strong Python capabilities. Make sure you include the most important <strong>keywords</strong> from the job spec.</p> <p>This does not just apply to technical skills either. When you’re researching the company website and reading through the job specification, take note of <strong>which values are important to the company</strong>. If they talk a lot about the importance of learning and self-improvement among employees, mention how you learned to code by doing tutorials at night. Or if their mission evolves around creating transparent, customer-centric solutions, talk about how you did that while working at X previous job.</p> <p>There’s several reasons for doing this. Firstly, you show that you’ve done your due diligence. You’ve read the job specification carefully and researched the company. This proves that you’ve spent some time on your application, and definitely more than the people who throw the same resume to every company. It also proves that you understand and care about the company mission, which makes you more relatable to hiring managers and indicates that you will fit in well with the other employees and the company culture as a whole.</p> <h2 id="highlight-skills-learned-from-other-fields">Highlight skills learned from other fields</h2> <p>A great resume is especially important early in your career, when you don’t have a lot of relevant experience. This is where you will need to rely entirely on your resume to move on to the next round. Later on, your previous work experience will do a lot of the heavy lifting - but that’s not the case if you’re applying for your first developer job.</p> <p>However, even if you don’t have a lot of related developer experience, you can still show your previous work places. Use these to highlight skills you learned <strong>that are also relevant for this job</strong>. If you’ve worked as a cashier, write how that has helped you interacting with customers and showing politeness. Or how being a football coach has taught you the importance of teamwork and leadership. Whatever your previous experience has been, highlight the key learnings from each.</p> <p>You can also use this to showcase some of your favourite moments from previous jobs, developer related or not. Things like “got promoted to manager after 2 years” or “launched a non-profit website on a super tight deadline” or “learned a new language for a specific project on the job”. If you’ve done awesome things that you’re proud of, don’t be afraid to show it. It feels more human than just listing the responsibilities you had.</p> <h2 id="practical-quick-wins">Practical quick wins</h2> <p>Keeping all of this in mind, there are also some simple, quick-win tips you can apply to make your resume more compelling:</p> <ul> <li>Keep it at <strong>1-2 page maximum</strong>. The receiver will simply not have time to read long walls of text. There might be potentially better candidates applying for this job, but by keeping your resume concise, you’ll get an advantage over them by actually having your resume read. Stick to a few (2-4) bullet points for each previous job or project.</li> <li><strong>Put your experience and skills at the top.</strong> This is the most important part of the resume, so make sure the receiver doesn’t accidentally miss it, or discard your resume before getting to these sections.</li> <li><strong>Show some personality.</strong> You don’t need to go crazy with colors and images, but adding small visual design elements will help your resume to stand out.</li> <li><strong>Use a template.</strong> There are tons of good CV template builders on the internet. Using a template will make your resume look more professional at a glance.</li> <li><strong>Proofread.</strong> And have a friend proofread as well. You want your resume to be as free of spelling mistakes and poor wording as possible.</li> </ul> <h2 id="final-notes">Final notes</h2> <p>Your resume might be your only chance at landing a particular job. The receiver of your resume will have to make a very quick judgement call of whether or not there’s a chance of you providing value to the company. If there is, you’ll move to the next round. If not, your application will get discarded.</p> <p>This may seem very cutthroat - and that’s because it is. But it’s how the world works. When reviewing your resume, try to put yourself in the shoes of the company or recruiter receiving it - would you pass yourself on to the next round? Even if you had as little as <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">7.4 seconds</a> to decide? If not, your resume could still use some work.</p> <p>If you're looking for more advice on how to land your dream developer job, check out my book at <a href="https://madsbrodt.com/mastering-coding-mindset/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mastering the Coding Mindset</a> or sign up using the form below.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
    I had a simple problem, I wanted to sell membership to <a href="https://smashnotes.com/clubhouse?utm_source=smashnotes.com&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_term=Clubhouse">The Clubhouse</a>, and I did not want to spend a lot of time building the infrastructure to do it. Really, all I wanted was a "buy now" button, a single landing page that could accept payments effortlessly, so I could then focus all of the efforts on outreach, instead of writing more code. 

Normally, for anything that involves taking payments, I would use Stripe. They are a trusted solution that somehow does everything right, every time. Honestly, I love them, but just as matter of curiosity, since I have been using Stripe for almost 10 years, I decided to explore alternatives. Shopify stock was going through the roof, I figured to try it out.

Before we go any further, I want to preface this by saying the purpose of this writeup is not to dunk on any of the payment providers. Each provider is there to accomplish a different objective,.

This is just a quick view into what you can expect, if you decide to sell with either Shopify or PayPal.

</p><h3>Getting started with Shopify</h3><p>

Getting started with Shopify was insanely easy. In quite literally less than five minutes I had my store setup and ready to sell a product on the internet. Unbelievably, insanely good start. In fact, if you have not had the pleasure of setting up a store yet, I recommend you get a Shopify account and try to sell something, even if it is fake, just to go through the experience. 

Unfortunately, my experimented ended right there because almost immediately Shopify blocked my account. What?! The exact reasons for blocking were murky, but I did a few things that may have caused fraud prevention to get some funny tickles.

</p><h3>How to get banned by Shopify 101</h3><p>

First,  there was no way to run a test transaction on Shopify, and to verify that my store was actually working, I had to buy my own product, so I did! Since signing up was so easy, I tested my own listing within minutes of signup. Great if you are testing, but suspicious if you are an algorithm.

Second, Shopify was designed for physical goods. You have to actually list your "inventory," which does not make any sense for a digital product. 10k Patio chairs is a lot, but for a digital product, anyone over 1 is the same. When I listed 10,000 units, it probably made some alarms go off.

Third, once I had my product set up, I switched to a "Shopify Button," a function advertised on their website, but very well hidden for anyone to actually use. It was exactly what I wanted - a simple "Buy Now" button that you can place anywhere, and even connect to social places like Facebook to sell direct. This option was perfect for me, but it required actually deleting my Shopify store, while maintaining my listed inventory. Honestly, I do not think their system actually expects this to happen.

All in all, quickly launching a store, listing 10,000 unites of inventory, and then hiding the store and replacing it with a button was enough for some algorithm to get worried and I got blocked. I did not like it, but if I were a scammer, I could hypothetically setup a new Shopify store with a fake product, run ads against it on social, collect millions of dollars in payments in minutes, all before anyone realizes it was just a front. It probably happens more often than we know, and I understand that Shopify needs to block potential fraud.

Getting locked out was not a big deal, really, but what really sucked was the way it was done. You lose access, to everything, without any notice and you cannot even contact support because being able to contact their support requires that you log into your account, the access to which you do not have! If it was not for a friend that I knew was working at Shopify, I do not know how I would unlocked my account again.

Thanks to my friend, the account got unblocked, and I was asked to provide some details in order to reactivate it. Well, to be specific, I was asked to provide ALL the details: passport, drivers, proof of address, ... [get the list]. I was asked to upload all of this highly sensitive personal information on myself into an online form, and hope for the best. Huh?! 

If I was a merchant that really needed to setup a store specifically with Shopify, I would probably jump through the hoops. But, given that I always have Stripe (love you!!!), giving all of my private information to Shopify`s random drop form did not seem like a good idea. Honestly, I do not know why they could not simply check my Keybase, or at least use a verified identity vendor, like the one used by  Airbnb or Coinbase.

Anyway, that was the end of Shopify for me[1].

</p><h3>Moving to PayPal</h3><p>

At this point a few days have gone by and I really wanted to start connecting with people, but there was still one problem, I needed to take payments. Sure, I could have faked it with a button that did not work and just collect intent, but if setting Shopify was only a matter of minutes, there had to be way!

Aha, the old forgotten friend PayPal! 

PayPal was built for this, to accept one-off payments for online transactions, from anyone in the world. I have a business account with them and I have used it before to both receive money and pay out too. Thinking that having a history on the account would help me avoid some obscure red flags, I dove into PayPal head first.

Getting started was relatively easy. Just go to Get Paid &gt; PayPal Button and choose the option applicable to you. I was looking into Smart Buttons vs Buy Now buttons, and the former seemed like a more modern solution, but turned out a fancy mess. Settings are in one place, test accounts in another, test numbers for the credit card are in yet another place, and when you put it all together, it still does not work. It felt like multiple startup acquisitions that have never finished integrating with each other. Ugh.

I was pretty close to giving up, and going back to beloved Stripe, but as one last experiment, I looked into their most basic old school "Buy Now" button from PayPal. It worked!

This is rather odd to admit, but the "Buy Now" button that was developed close to 20 years ago is still the easiest way to collect money online. It is ugly, it uses a basic Form to post values, and it is got an Image[2] as the main clickable element, but it works!

This version of the button lets me do everything in one go - specify the product, specify the cost,  put the code on the site and run it. All in just one step.

</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>

Alright, so what is the best solution to selling a one-off item online? Is it Stripe, Shopify, or is it actually PayPal?

Honestly, if you just need to sell something, just use PayPal. It is not going to have fancy features or look pretty good, there his no inventory tracking, or integrations, there is nothing but a dumb button and a way to take money.

I am still a little amused that a product that was create 20 years ago is the best option today. 

Of course, if you are selling a physical good, something that requires packaging, shipping, tracking and all the complexity that goes with it, I would say give Shopify a really deep try. They seem to have it all integrated, and even if you have to jump through the verification hoops, provided you have a real business, it would probably be all worth it.

Lastly, if you are building an online sales funnel, want to integrate your app with your customers` data, and in general enjoy working with a company that does everything amazingly well, there is always Stripe!

Happy hacking.
~Kirill

[1] One interesting bit to note, it seems that Shopify is actually using Stripe to collect their payments on their end. I infer from getting a Stripe error message, that came through on the Shopify front-end.

[2] Besides, if you want to make it less ugly, all it takes is to replace the Image with a Button and apply your own styles. It still works.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>tl;dl Rust port of
<a href="https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html">https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html</a>
to parse fixed 16 integer.</p>

<p>Note that a lot of the text are taken from the original article along with my
additional comments but the code will be written as Rust.</p>



<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it is JSON, maybe it is a CSV file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>todo!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>We will be using nightly to be able to use the feature <code>test</code> which comes with
the nightly release. Use <code>rustup toolchain add nightly</code> to install the nigthly
toolchain.</p>

<p>We will be creating the project by using <code>cargo new parseint --lib</code> to create a
new library. Next, we will specify that we will be using the nightly toolchain
for this crate by <code>echo nightly &gt; rust-toolchain</code>.</p>

<p>Our <code>benches/bench.rs</code> will be something like the following.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#![feature(test)]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> <span>test</span><span>;</span>

<span>use</span> <span>parseint</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>test</span><span>::{</span><span>black_box</span><span>,</span> <span>Bencher</span><span>};</span>

<span>const</span> <span>EXAMPLE_TIMESTAMP</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1585201087123789"</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>EXPECTED_TIMESTAMP</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>1585201087123789</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every time we create a new function for benchmark, we will append the following
block to <code>benches/bench.rs</code> prepended by <code>bench_</code> to keep naming simple. Say we
have a function <code>str_parse</code> (coming up next), so it will not be written later.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[bench]</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having the <code>assert_eq</code> is a safety measure that our functions live up to its’
expectations. <code>b.bytes</code> allows us to have nice throughput output when we run
<code>cargo bench</code> to benchmark later. <code>black_box</code> prevent the compiler from
optimizing the test code which may affect the result.</p>



<p>Let us start with what is available. We have <code>str::parse</code> from standard library
which acts as a baseline for the comparison later.</p>

<p>From now on, we will only be showing the code be write in <code>src/lib.rs</code>, note
that we will also add code to <code>bench.rs</code> as shown above but we will not specify
it here.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>str_parse</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.parse</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that comparing it to <code>str::parse</code> with the other functions is not fair
since it is design to validate and handle numbers with different length. And I
would say it the standard library version is already quite optimized. One can
look into the assembly code by using <code>cargo asm parseint::str_parse --rust</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> pub fn str_parse(s: &amp;str) -&gt; u64 {

<p>Running <code>cargo bench</code> gives us.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test bench_str_parse           ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 1) = 695 MB/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we are trying to parse, and we do
not need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster? Just how much time is
spent in validation?</p>



<p>Let us write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_chars</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>digit</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span> <span>as</span> <span>u64</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>result</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>test bench_naive_chars         ... bench:          18 ns/iter (+/- 0) = 888 MB/s
test bench_str_parse           ... bench:          23 ns/iter (+/- 1) = 695 MB/s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the naive version is already slightly faster (~27%) than the
original version.</p>

<p>In the Rust official book, it was said to produce better performing code. Let us
try that out here.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_chars_iter</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does not produce code which performs faster here but the code now is shorter
and slightly easier to read in my own opinion.</p>

<p>Somewhere, during a conversion in <code>Rust 众</code>, a Rust telegram group with people
mainly from China (Taiwan have a separate group <code>rust.tw</code>). Someone mentioned
that it may be faster to get the value of a number by using bitwise and. Looking
at the ASCII table (<code>man ascii</code>), noticed that it all ends with the same number.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>   2 3 4 5 6 7       30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120

<p>Here, we start from the digit <code>0</code>, decimal <code>48</code>, octal <code>30</code>, binary <code>110000</code>.
Going up to <code>9</code>, decimal <code>57</code>, octal <code>39</code>, binary <code>111001</code>. Noticed that the
octal version and binary version have the digits at the last byte (<code>0000</code> -
<code>1001</code>), we could have do a <code>&amp; 0x0f</code> to get the last 4 bits.</p>

<p>Being naive here, we just ignore the 5 possible values after <code>9</code> in the ASCII
table. Let us try to add this and see if it is faster.</p>

<p>Nice, 1ns improvement, quite good for just an operator change from minus to
bitwise and.</p>



<p>When someone started to explore parsing and string manipulation in Rust. It is
likely that one would have heard that iterating on bytes would be faster than
iterating on characters.</p>

<p>This is because Rust <code>String</code> is always UTF-8 encoded, <code>String::chars</code> is
iterating on <code>char</code> which represents a Unicode Scalar Value. But we know that
<code>0</code> to <code>9</code> in ASCII will always be a single byte. <code>String::bytes</code> which returns
an iterator on <code>u8</code> would work for us. I bet this is faster, let us add that.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_bytes</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>

<p>It involves very simple change, by changing <code>chars</code> to <code>bytes</code>, and <code>'0'</code> to
<code>b'0'</code>. But doing this improves the benchmark by another 70%, huge drop of 7ns.
We have now reduced more than half the time from the baseline.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>After completing the port (including the parts below), I share the results to
<a href="https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json/issues/132">simd-json issues</a>, @Licenser
did a review and gave some feedback to improve the performance. One of them is
to reduce bound checking by specifying the number of bytes to take. I am
surprised that this can further improve the results of <code>naive_bytes_and</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>naive_bytes_and_c16</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>u64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.bytes</span><span>()</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It does look obvious to me that we are working with 16 characters but the
compiler does not know this. I really hoped that bound checking can be removed
later so that users (if there is a way) do not need to do godbolting to reduce
the bound checking. We can do this by specifying <code>take</code> on <code>Iterator</code>. I am
surprised that this improves the timing by another 2ns (20%).</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’ve been playing around with OpenAI’s new
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a> language model. When I got
beta access, the first thing I wondered was, how human is GPT-3? How
close is it to passing a Turing test?</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>Let me explain how exactly I’m generating these conversations. GPT-3
is a general language model, trained on a large amount of
uncategorized text from the internet. It isn’t
specific to a conversational format, and it isn’t trained to answer
any specific type of question. The only thing it does is, given some
text, guess what text comes next.</p>

<p>So if we want GPT-3 to generate answers to questions, we need to seed
it with a “prompt”. I’m using this prompt to initialize all of the Q&amp;A
sessions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is human life expectancy in the United States?
A: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1955?
A: Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States in 1955.

Q: What party did he belong to?
A: He belonged to the Republican Party.

Q: Who was president of the United States before George W. Bush?
A: Bill Clinton was president of the United States before George W. Bush.

Q: Who won the World Series in 1995?
A: The Atlanta Braves won the World Series in 1995.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the default prompt suggested by OpenAI for Q&amp;A, so I’m not
cherrypicking it to prove anything. The point of this prompt is just
to show GPT-3 that we’re doing questions and answers, not to provide
it with information. For the prompt, both questions and answers are provided by a
human. For all the others, the answers are generated by GPT-3.</p>

<h2 id="common-sense">Common Sense</h2>

<p>Traditionally, artificial intelligence struggles at “common sense”. But
GPT-3 can answer a lot of common sense questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: What is your favorite animal?
A: My favorite animal is a dog.

Q: Why?
A: Because dogs are loyal and friendly.

Q: What are two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood?
A: Two reasons that a dog might be in a bad mood are if it is hungry or if it is hot.

Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many legs does a frog have?
A: A frog has four legs.

Q: Are there any animals with three legs?
A: No, there are no animals with three legs.

Q: Why don't animals have three legs?
A: Animals don't have three legs because they would fall over.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ten years ago, if I had this conversation, I would have assumed the
entity on the other end was a human. You can no longer take it for
granted that an AI does not know the answer to “common sense” questions.</p>

<p>How does GPT-3 know that a giraffe have two eyes? I wish I had some
sort of “debug output” to answer that question. I don’t know for sure,
but I can only theorize that there must be some web page in its
training data that discusses how many eyes a giraffe has. If we want
to stump GPT-3 with common sense questions, we need to think of
questions about things so mundane, they will not appear on the internet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code> Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or an elephant?
 A: An elephant is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a mouse or a toaster?
 A: A toaster is heavier than a mouse.

 Q: Which is heavier, a toaster or a pencil?
 A: A pencil is heavier than a toaster.

 Q: Which is heavier, a paper clip or a can of soda?
 A: A can of soda is heavier than a paper clip.

 Q: Which is heavier, a football player or a car?
 A: A car is heavier than a football player.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s only 4/5. We’re closer to stumping GPT-3 here. I think a human
would be pretty close to 100% on these questions. It makes sense these
are trickier - there probably isn’t any web page that compares
toasters and pencils by weight. It’s only indirectly that humans gain
this knowledge.</p>

<p>This gives us a hint for how to stump the AI more consistently. We
need to ask questions that no normal human would ever talk about.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many eyes does a giraffe have?
A: A giraffe has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does my foot have?
A: Your foot has two eyes.

Q: How many eyes does a spider have?
A: A spider has eight eyes.

Q: How many eyes does the sun have?
A: The sun has one eye.

Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?
A: A blade of grass has one eye.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re getting into surreal territory. GPT-3 knows how to have a
normal conversation. It doesn’t quite know how to say “Wait a
moment… your question is nonsense.” It also doesn’t know how to say
“I don’t know.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.

Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.

Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.

Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep
furiously.

Q: Do you understand these questions?
A: I understand these questions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The lesson here is that if you’re a judge in a Turing test, make sure
you ask some nonsense questions, and see if the interviewee responds
the way a human would.</p>

<h2 id="trivia-questions">Trivia Questions</h2>

<p>GPT-3 is quite good at answering questions about obscure things.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1801?
A: Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States in 1801.

Q: What city is in the northwest corner of Ohio?
A: Toledo is in the northwest corner of Ohio.

Q: What highway do you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland?
A: Highway 80 is the highway you take to get to North Lake Tahoe from Oakland.

<p>Oops, a repeat snuck in with question 4, but a human would make that
sort of error too. GPT-3 seems to be above
human-level on this sort of question. The tricky thing for
applications, I think, is to figure out when the answer can be relied
on. The OpenAI API does expose more data than just the text, here, so
perhaps something clever is possible.</p>

<p>In general, if you are trying to distinguish an AI from a human, you
don’t want to ask it obscure trivia questions. GPT-3 is pretty good at
a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>One trend that continues from the common sense is that GPT-3 is
reluctant to express that it doesn’t know the answer. So invalid
questions get wrong answers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who was president of the United States in 1700?
A: William Penn was president of the United States in 1700.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1650?
A: Richard Bennett was president of the United States in 1650.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1620?
A: James I was president of the United States in 1620.

Q: Who was president of the United States in 1600?
A: Queen Elizabeth I was president of the United States in 1600.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These wrong answers are actually fascinating! None of these were
presidents of the United States, of course, since the US didn’t exist
then. But they are all prominent political figures who were in charge
of some US-related political entity around that time. In a sense, they
are good guesses.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Who won the World Series in 2021?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2021.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2022?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2022.

Q: Who won the World Series in 2023?
A: The New York Yankees won the World Series in 2023.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bleak view of a dystopian future.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: How many Super Bowls do the Cincinnati Bengals win in the 2030s?
A: The Cincinnati Bengals win two Super Bowls in the 2030s.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Encouraging as a Bengals fan, but perhaps not the objectively most accurate
prediction. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>

<p>People are used to computers being superhuman at logical activities,
like playing chess or adding numbers. It might come as a surprise that
GPT-3 is not perfect at simple math questions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: When counting, what number comes before 100?
A: Ninety-nine comes before 100.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 123?
A: One hundred and twenty-two comes before 123.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 1000?
A: Nine hundred and ninety-nine comes before 1000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before 10,000?
A: Nine thousand and ninety-nine comes before 10,000.

Q: When counting, what number comes before a million?
A: Nine hundred thousand and ninety-nine comes before a million.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the generic nature of GPT-3 comes into play. It isn’t
just the generic model, though, it’s also the architecture of neural
networks themselves. As far as I know there is no neural network that
is capable of doing basic arithmetic like addition and multiplication
on a large number of digits based on training data rather than
hardcoding.</p>

<p>It’s funny, because these operations are simple for a customized
program. But recursive logic that does some operation and repeats it
several times often doesn’t quite map onto the architecture of a
neural net well.</p>

<p>An interesting corollary is that GPT-3 often finds it easier to write
code to solve a programming problem, than to solve the problem on one
example input:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: Write one line of Ruby code to reverse an array.
A: ary.reverse

Q: Write one line of Ruby code to count how many X's are in an array.
A: ary.count { |x| x == 'X' }

Q: Reverse the following array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: [10, 6, 4, 2, 77, 3, 5, 1]

Q: How many X's are in this array: [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 4, 2, 77]
A: 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This problem shows up in more human questions as well, if you ask
it about the result of a sequence of operations.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Q: If I have a marble and a paper clip in a box, put a pencil in the box,
and remove the marble, what is left?
A: A paper clip.

Q: If I have two shoes in a box, put a pencil in the box, and
remove one shoe, what is left?
A: A shoe.

Q: If I put a pencil in a box, then put another pencil in the box,

<p>LAMBDA IN Python has been derived from functional programming, however
there is nothing that lambda can do that can’t be done with the usual
<code>def foo(*args, **kwargs): ...</code> syntax. At the advent of Python3 <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196" target="_blank">Guido proposed
to remove lambda from Python</a>,
but relented and allowed it to stay.</p>
<p>Haskell is a canonical functional programming language, it relies heavily on
lambda calculus, although it does have a lambda syntax : <code>(\x -&gt; x + 1)</code>, this is equivalent to <code>(+1)</code>. How can this be? Every function is a lambda function.</p>
<p>We’ll take a quick look at lambda calculus using Python. Then I’ll claim <strong>we
don’t use lambda calculus in Python</strong>, despite
all the great advantages it gives Haskell programmers. Finally we’ll look at how we
use <code>lambda</code> in Python and discuss why it should have been changed going into Python3.</p>
<p>I know this will be an aggravating read for many
pythonistas, but please try to remain calm and keep an open mind. <strong>Don’t
comment without reading first!</strong></p>
<section><h2>Lambda Calculus</h2>
<div>
<p>
(\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y)(2)(3)
= (\lambda y. 2 + y)(3)
= 2 + 3
</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" target="_blank">LAMBDA CALCULUS (aka. <span><span>\lambda</span></span>-calculus)</a>
is Turing Complete, meaning <strong>we can make programs from just lambda</strong>. In lambda calculus, the
function <code>lambda x: x</code> would be written as <span><span>\lambda x.x</span></span>.</p>
<p>In Python we have some syntactic sugar, <code>lambda x, y: x + y</code> is actually accepting a tuple
of arguments. In the examples I’m being strict and passing arguments individually as per the
maths syntax <span><span>\lambda x. \lambda y. x + y</span></span>.</p>
<p>To resolve a lambda
expression, we substitute in arguments. I’ve shown it in Python syntax so you can
run the functions.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>))(</span><span>2</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You can use this syntax to create all manner of programs because <strong>you can substitute
functions as well as values</strong>.</p>
<p>Here we have a function that accepts another function
and a single argument. It is given a function that adds 1 to a single argument,
and then it is given 4 as an argument.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)))(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>a</span><span>))(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
<span>4</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>As a glimpse into what can be done with lambda calculus, here’s an ‘if-then-else’
branching function where we’ve broken the rules of lambda calculus by naming the
functions to aid readability.</p>
<p>For more about lambda calculus in Python syntax,
I’d recommend a talk from EuroPython 2017 by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsfMMYvGaU" target="_blank">Anjana Vakil, called “Mary had a little lambda”</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>TRUE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span>
<span>FALSE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>y</span>
<span>IFELSE</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>

<span># Output: 1</span>

</pre></div>

</section><section><h2>Lambda Calculus: <strong>+</strong></h2>
<p>LAMBDA, WHEN used in a programming language to define functions gives you
currying and thus partial application built in. If you’ve read
<a href="http://www.paulbrownmagic.com/blog/python_partial_application" target="_blank">Python Partial: Code Your Intention</a>, you’ll
know I’m a big fan of this.</p>
<p>Lambda calculus can provide features we find in Python, which we know and love, such as
first-class functions and higher-order functions, because we can pass functions
around.</p>
<p>It can also be used for lazy evaluation: the substitutions can be undertaken
without executing the functions. This also allows a compiler, such as the
Haskell compiler, to reduce the computation required when composing functions together.</p>
</section><section><h2><strong>No</strong> Lambda in Python</h2>
<p>I LOVE the benefits of lambda calculus, I love Python. The two do not mix. In Python our functions
are not curried or evaluated using lambda calculus, we know this because functions
need all their arguments when called.
Consider the difference between these two addition functions.</p>
<p><code>l_add</code> needs the arguments passed one at a time. We never see this syntax with multiple parenthesis
in Python. It works and it has many benefits built in, but it would be a paradigm
shift to expect pythonistas to start writing their programs this way, it’s just
not Pythonic.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>l_add</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>b</span> <span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>

<span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>l_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Compare this to Haskell, which is built for using lambda calculus. Haskell’s syntax
is less verbose, easier to write, there’s no annoying parenthesis and the
benefits of currying are built in.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- declaring the function</span>
<span>l_add</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>-- calling the function</span>
<span>l_add</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>

<span>-- partial application</span>
<span>incr</span> <span>=</span> <span>l_add</span> <span>1</span>
<span>-- calling the partial function</span>
<span>incr</span> <span>2</span>
</pre></div>

</section><section><h2><strong>But That’s Not How We Use Lambda In Python</strong></h2>
<p>I KNOW! In Python we call our functions with all their arguments at the same time,  even <code>lambda x, y: x + y</code> is expecting both arguments together. Typical use cases in Python are for very short inline functions, usually when being passed to a higher-order function.</p>
<p>During the debate about removing lambda from Python3,
<a href="https://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&amp;thread=98196&amp;start=30&amp;msRange=15" target="_blank">Kay Schluehr proposed an inline syntax</a>,
it should be possible to make use of the use of <code>_</code> with <code>inline</code> to create anonymous
functions that fulfil our requirement, encode our intention, and stay pythonic.</p>
<p>In Python <strong><code>lambda</code> is a short,
inline, anonymous function</strong>. But, <strong>an anonymous function is not a calculus.</strong></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Typical use cases</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>max</span><span>(</span><span>my_tuples</span><span>,</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>lambda</span> <span>t</span><span>:</span> <span>t</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>

<span># More pythonic? Closer to the user intent?</span>
<span>map</span><span>(</span><span>inline</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>max</span><span>(</span><span>my_tuples</span><span>,</span> <span>key</span><span>=</span><span>inline</span> <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>):</span> <span>t</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>])</span>
</pre></div>

</section><section><h2>Add Sugar</h2>
<p><strong>PYTHON IS capable
of lambda calculus, but it is not considered pythonic to use it.</strong> If a
library like <code>datetime</code> were to use lambda calculus there would be outcry from the community,
no-one would want to call functions with a set of parenthesis for each argument.</p>
<p>But the <strong>normal way to call a function could be made syntactic sugar for
the lambda calculus way</strong>. Just like in Haskell, Python would not <em>need</em>
a <code>lambda</code> syntax. This imaginary case reveals how the <code>lambda</code> syntax is not being
used appropriately. If <code>def foo(x): ...</code> were this syntactic sugar, how would we declare our inline anonymous functions?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Normal python call:</span>
<span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>date</span><span>(</span><span>2018</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>)</span>

<span># Lambda calculus call:</span>
<span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>date</span><span>(</span><span>2018</span><span>)(</span><span>3</span><span>)(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p><small markdown="1">If you like that
syntactic sugar, check out <a href="https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curry.html" target="_blank">toolz curry</a>.
Wouldn’t it be nice if we didn’t have to use the decorator?</small></p>
</section><section><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>IF EVERY function were a lambda function with some syntactic sugar, we’d still
need a way to declare inline anonymous functions. This brings us back to needing
something like <code>inline _(): ...</code>. This also brings back my argument for all
the functional programming techniques I have covered in this blog so far: <strong>Code
the authors intention</strong>.</p>
<p>In Python, <strong>we do not use <code>lambda</code> with the intention of using lambda calculus</strong>. Our
syntax needs to encode our intention in the places we have used it, and where we will use it.
These use cases are inline, anonymous functions.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure how much of the hemoglobin in blood is carrying oxygen (oxygen saturation).</p>
<p>If you work in healthcare (or have been patient !) you are very likely to have come across pulse oximeters. You can find them in areas such as operating rooms, recovery, critical care, wards, and ambulances.</p>
<p>Pulse oximeters are in common use because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non invasive</li>
<li>cheap to buy and use</li>
<li>can be very compact</li>
<li>detects hypoxaemia earlier than you using your eyes to see cyanosis.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Oxygen Saturation</h3>
<p>Pulse oximeters measure oxygen saturation. Before we learn the principles of how pulse oximeters work, we need to have an understanding of what oxygen saturation is.</p>
<p>We all know that we need oxygen for life. ( Some of you may find this section a little too basic. In that case, to skip this short section, click this link to go to next section Physical properties used in pulse oximetry )</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/solo_oxygen.gif" alt="solo_oxygen" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen enters the lungs and then is passed on into blood. The blood carries the oxygen to the various organs in our body. The main way oxygen is carried in our blood is by means of hemoglobin. You can imagine hemoglobin molecules( Hb) as “cars” and the “roads” being our blood vessels. The oxygen molecules get into these cars and travel around the body till they reach their destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg" alt="cars_wikipedia" width="800" height="431" srcset="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cars_wikipedia.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>Let us consider these ” hemoglobin cars”.</p>
<p>The hemoglobin without oxygen we will call de oxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy Hb). The hemoglobin with oxygen, we will call oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy Hb).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_car.gif" alt="oxy_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Oxygen saturation simply refers to the percentage of the available hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Take the situations below. There are 16 hemoglobin units and none of the 16 have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 0 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_car.gif" alt="zero_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Here, 8 of the 16 Hb have oxygen. The oxygen saturation is therefore 50 %.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fifty_car.gif" alt="fifty_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Similarly for 75 % …</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seventy_five_car.gif" alt="seventy_five_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>And of course , when all the Hb have oxygen, the saturation is 100 %</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_car.gif" alt="hundred_car" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>So in summary, oxygen saturation tells you the percentage of the total hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Physical properties used in pulse oximetry</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry uses light to work out oxygen saturation. Light is emitted from light sources which goes across the pulse oximeter probe and reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_intro.gif" alt="red_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>If a finger is placed in between the light source and the light detector, the light will now have to pass through the finger to reach the detector. Part of the light will be absorbed by the finger and the part not absorbed reaches the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_finger_intro.gif" alt="red_finger_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>The amount of light that is absorbed by the finger depends on many physical properties and these properties are used by the pulse oximeter to calculate the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>The amount of light absorbed depends on the following:</p>
<p>1. concentration of the light absorbing substance.</p>
<p>2. length of the light path in the absorbing substance</p>
<p>3. oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorbs red and infrared light differently</p>
<p>Don’t worry ! All the above will be explained in the next sections:</p>
<p>The physical properties that a pulse oximeter employs will be explained using the probe shown below. A finger is shown inserted into the probe. Above the finger are the light sources that emit light. In the finger is an artery which carries the blood the pulse oximeter is interested in and a vein through which the blood leaves the finger. Below the finger is the light detector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/av_intro.gif" alt="av_intro" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<hr>
<h4>Physical property No.1 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</h4>
<p>Hemoglobin (Hb) absorbs light. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of Hb in the blood vessel. In the diagram below, the blood vessels in both fingers have the same diameter. However, one blood vessel has a low Hb concentration ( i.e. low number of Hb in each unit volume of blood) and the other blood vessel has a high Hb concentration ( i.e. high number of Hb in each unit volume of blood). Each single Hb absorbs some of the light, so more the Hb per unit area, more is the light is absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Beer’s Law”.</p>
<p>Beer’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the light absorbing substance</p>
<p>By measuring how much light reaches the light detector, the pulse oximeter knows how much light has been absorbed. More the Hb in the finger , more is the light absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/conc_absorb.gif" alt="conc_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.2 : Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the light path.</h4>
<p>Look at the two fingers shown below. Both arteries have the same concentration (same Hb per unit area, blue square) However, the artery on right is wider than the one on the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/square_frames.gif" alt="square_frames" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The light emitted from the source has to travel through the artery. The light travels in a shorter path in the narrow artery and travels through a longer path in the wider artery ( paths are shown as green lines below). Though the concentration of Hb is the same in both arteries, the light meets more Hb in the wider artery, since it travels in a longer path. Therefore, longer the path the light has to travel, more is the light absorbed. This property is described in a law in physics called “Lambert’s Law”.</p>
<p>Lambert’s Law: Amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/light_path.gif" alt="light_path" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<h4>Physical property No.3 : oxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light than red light &amp; deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light than infrared light (this is explained below !)</h4>
<p>We have seen how concentration and light path affect the absorbance of light. In addition to these, the pulse oximeter makes use of another important property to calculate oxygen saturation. That is, oxy hemoglobin and deoxy hemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way.</p>
<p>Before we go further, we need to remember what wavelength is. All light is composed of waves. The distance between the “tips” of the waves is equal to the wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength.gif" alt="wavelength" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Light wavelengths are very short, and the unit of measurement is nanometer (nm) ( 1 meter = 1,000,000,000 nanometers !). For an example, the wave on the left has a wavelength of 650 nm and the wave on the right has a longer wavelength of 950 nm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wavelength_number.gif" alt="wavelength_number" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Different “colors” of light have their own wavelength.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wave_show.gif" alt="wave_show" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses the property that oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin absorb light of different wavelengths in a specific way. This property can be demonstrated in a laboratory as will be now described. We can first demonstrate how oxyhemoglobin absorbs light of different wavelengths in a specific way. We use a special light source of which we can adjust the wavelength of the light it emits. This light source sequentially passes light of different wavelengths through a sample of oxy Hb. The detector notes how much light, at each wavelength, has been absorbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red_multiwavelength.gif" alt="red_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>A graph for the absorbance of oxy hemoglobin at different wavelengths will look like this. It shows that oxy Hb doesn’t absorb the same amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_curve.gif" alt="oxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>We can repeat the same demonstration using deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/blue_multiwavelength.gif" alt="blue_multiwavelength" width="246" height="403"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>Again notice , how like oxy Hb, Deoxy Hb absorbs different amount of light at different wavelengths.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_curve.gif" alt="deoxy_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now let us see the absorbance graph of oxy Hb and the absorbance graph of deoxy Hb together so you can compare them. Note how each of them absorbs light of different wavelengths very differently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_curve.gif" alt="combined_curve" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter uses two lights to analyze hemoglobin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/r_ir_finger.gif" alt="r_ir_finger" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>One is a red light, which has a wavelength of approximately 650 nm. The other is an infrared light, which has a wavelength of 950 nm. (Throughout our description, we will show the infrared light in light blue. In reality, infrared light is invisible to the human eye.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/labelled_led.gif" alt="labelled_led" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>Now look at the oxy Hb absorbance graph again, but this time paying attention to the wavelengths of light used in pulse oximeters. You will see that oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_absorb.gif" alt="oxy_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Below is the graph that shows the absorbance of deoxy Hb. It is seen from the graph that deoxy Hb absorbs more Red light than Infrared light.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/deoxy_aborb.gif" alt="deoxy_aborb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>To make the comparison of absorbance of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb easier, here is a composite graph showing the absorbance of both. You will see that :</p>
<p>Oxy Hb absorbs more infrared light than red light</p>
<p>Deoxy Hb absorbs more red light than infrared light</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/combined_absorb.gif" alt="combined_absorb" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>You might find the memory aide below useful to remember the wavelengths absorbed by oxy Hb and deoxy Hb.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/absorb_memory.gif" alt="absorb_memory" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>The pulse oximeter works out the oxygen saturation by comparing how much red light and infra red light is absorbed by the blood. Depending on the amounts of oxy Hb and deoxy Hb present, the ratio of the amount of red light absorbed compared to the amount of infrared light absorbed changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/oxy_ratio.gif" alt="oxy_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Using this ratio, the pulse oximeter can then work out the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ratio_computer.gif" alt="ratio_computer" width="800" height="332"></a></p>
<p>For an example, at 100 % saturation, the absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will be same as that seen with the oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/hundred_ratio.gif" alt="hundred_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>At 0 % saturation, there is only deoxy Hb. The absorbance ratio ( i.e. comparing how much red light and infrared light is absorbed) will therefore be same as that seen with the de oxy Hb absorbance curve that we saw earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif"><img src="https://www.howequipmentworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/zero_ratio.gif" alt="zero_ratio" width="800" height="437"></a></p>
<p>Now look at when the patient has an oxygen saturation of 75 %. The blood has both , oxy Hb and deoxy Hb. The absorbance pattern is now somewhere in between the oxy Hb curve and deoxy Hb …</p></div></div></section></div></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
<p>Over the past two months I’ve built <a href="https://friendlycaptcha.com/">FriendlyCaptcha</a>, a privacy friendly alternative to Google reCAPTCHA. Normally if I were to start a new web application, I would write the server code in Golang, spin up a Postgres instance, and host a dockerized version of it on Google Cloud Run to get many of the serverless benefits.</p>
<p>For a CAPTCHA product the requirements were a bit different: it is crtical that its API is fast, always available, has predictable costs, and can scale up and down instantly. A CAPTCHA service being down is a big issue for users, they can’t verify the challenges submitted by their website visitors and face a dilemma: to allow requests without a valid challenge or to reject all requests (I propose they do the first!).</p>
<p>Serverless can be a good choice for minimizing the risk of downtime for your APIs, especially if you only have a small team. There are less moving parts, a datacenter outage doesn’t mean your service is down, and also the individual workers are more isolated and short-lived reducing the chance of an error putting your server into an unrecoverable bad state.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-workers">Cloudflare Workers<a href="#cloudflare-workers">#</a></h2>
<p>A couple years ago Cloudflare launched <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Workers</a>, a serverless platform that runs your code on <em>the edge</em>. That means your code runs in their datacenters all over the world, so any callee should have good latency from just about everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Your code in a Cloudflare Worker runs in a V8 isolate which means that the overhead of cold starts is extremely small (less than 5ms), and response times in general are ridiculously fast because of this. This makes it great for server side rendering and APIs.</p>
<p>There is a catch, you have to make sure your server logic ‘fits’ within these limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than 50ms of computation time for given request. Time that your script is waiting for a request does not count and not doing any computation.</li>
<li>Your code needs to either be written in Javascript or be a WebAssembly binary. Your total code bundle can only be 1MB in total size.</li>
<li>You can not use more than 128MB of memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can make it work you get a whole lot in return.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-state">Keeping state<a href="#keeping-state">#</a></h2>
<p>Most applications or APIs have some state, even if it’s only secrets used for authentication. You could of course talk to your relational database of choice, but that removes any latency advantages of running code on the edge and re-introduces a single point of failure(unless you have your own globally replicated relational database, which is possible, but as we’re starting a new product here we don’t have that just yet).</p>
<p>Instead we can keep state in a few different ways:</p>
<h3 id="cache">Cache<a href="#cache">#</a></h3>
<p>Cloudflare Workers offers a cache that is at the level of a datacenter. This is useful for caching objects for minutes up to hours.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha this is how we can cache valid API keys without talking to the database every time.</p>
<h3 id="workers-kv">Workers KV<a href="#workers-kv">#</a></h3>
<p>Workers KV is a key value store that is globally distributed and eventually consistent, built into Cloudflare Workers. It is designed for infrequent writing (up to once per second), but frequent reading. This is great if you want to cache data that your worker simply forwards (e.g. a file on S3). If you frequently read from a key its value will get cached in the local edge datacenter.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha this is used to store user sessions when you log into the website.</p>
<h3 id="serverless-friendly-databases">Serverless-friendly databases<a href="#serverless-friendly-databases">#</a></h3>
<p>Workers KV is not a great place to store data such as your user’s data due to its eventual consistency and lack of powerful query support. Databases such as <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore">Firestore</a> are a good fit for the serverless model, it’s a fully managed service and you pay for usage and data storage instead of nodes and uptime.</p>
<p>In FriendlyCaptcha it is important that the solution of a solved CAPTCHA can not be re-used, by storing all completed puzzles in FaunaDB as well as in the Cloudflare Cache we can make sure that never happens.</p>
<h2 id="website-on-the-edge">Website on the edge<a href="#website-on-the-edge">#</a></h2>
<p>By rendering the website on the edge you can achieve very quick response times and small bundle sizes, while still allowing you to use a templating engine and adapt the page to the user (e.g. for thei dashboard).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://friendlycaptcha.com/">FriendlyCaptcha website</a> is pure HTML and CSS that all gets rendered on the edge, there is no client-size Javascript. While I love frameworks like React, for a website (and many websites really) it’s overkill. By rendering the website on the edge you get something that’s in between a fully static website and a dynamic website.</p>
<p>For templating I use <a href="https://github.com/popeindustries/lit-html-server">lit-html-server</a>, and I’m happy with that choice. It’s just Javascript and template literals that you can compose in a way that makes sense for you, there was no new framework to learn.</p>
<p>For a bigger real world example of a serverside rendering approach using CloudFlare workers is the <a href="https://discord.gg/">Discord website</a>, it is so fast.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-cloudflare-workers">What are the advantages of Cloudflare Workers?<a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-cloudflare-workers">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Your code runs close to the client in multiple datacenters, you don’t have to manage any of that, and you can sleep at night knowing that a sudden hug of death probably won’t take down your service.</li>
<li>Predictable pricing, which at small to medium scale is often much lower than the classic load balancer + application servers setup.</li>
<li>Less moving parts: a single script containing all API and website logic makes life easier. Having a development, staging and production environment is easy this way.</li>
<li>If you are replacing a (SPA) you can start moving logic to the server, decreasing bundle size and the amount of endpoints you have to expose.</li>
<li>The tooling is fairly good, there’s a way to have environment variables and manage secrets, and you can preview your site/API locally.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-some-disadvantages">What are some disadvantages?<a href="#what-are-some-disadvantages">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In most serverless Javascript environments your code does not run in Node. Many libraries and client SDKs will only work in a Node environment.. I couldn’t use the SDK for BigQuery, Sentry, Mailgun or Stripe, and instead had to use their REST APIs.</li>
<li>There are limitations: only few languages are supported, 1MB max script size, 50ms runtime, 128MB of memory.</li>
<li>There is some degree of lock-in. CloudFlare workers follow the Webworker spec, so it should be fairly easy to move to another provider, but if you use any goodies such as their KV distributed datastore changing that code to use something like Redis instead will require some effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-go-fully-serverless">Should I go (fully) serverless?<a href="#should-i-go-fully-serverless">#</a></h2>
<p>Probably not, think about the application that you are building and whether any of these advantages matter. You can probably start off by writing the backend logic in your preferred language and running that on a machine on your favorite cloud provider. When that single machine no longer cuts it, you can introduce more machines.</p>
<p>Remember that if you are trying to build a product, whether something costs $5 or $10 per month probably won’t make the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>If your load is unpredictable, you require low latency, and you need reliability, then perhaps it may be the right choice. If you are building a tiny service, such as a Slack bot or a log-in wall in front of a static website, serverless is probably a great choice.</p>
<p>Finally, another good reason to use it is for fun or just to get acquainted with serverless. Limitations and constraints usually foster creative problem solving, which is perfect for hobby projects.</p>

July 16, 2020 | https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/british-diplomat-works-with-north-korean-military/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>To tell people that you had a close working relationship with the North Korean military for a 6 month period would in itself raise more than a few eyebrows. Working for 3 years in North Korea was on the one hand a time of frustration and on the other a time of discovery in this fascinating&nbsp;yet enigmatic country. Butting heads on a daily basis with the stifling North Korean bureaucracy was always a battle, but occasionally there was a glimmer of achievement and sometimes from the most unlikeliest of sources.</p>
<p>In early 2004, I was contacted at the embassy in Pyongyang by the brother of an RAF pilot who had been shot down in 1952 over North Korea during the Korean war. He said he had full details of the shoot down supplied by eyewitness United States Air Force (USAF) pilots and map coordinates of the site of the crash (which he sent to me) and wished to visit the area to discover the fate of his brother.</p>
<p>The background was that the pilot, Flt Lt Desmond Hinton, who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II for shooting down two Japanese fighters had bailed out of his burning F84e Thunderjet whilst carrying out a strafing mission north east of Pyongyang on 2 January 1952. At the time, Flt Lt Hinton was one of a number of RAF pilots who were attached to and flying with the USAF. Despite enquiries after the war and with no further information as to his fate forthcoming, Flt Lt Hinton was subsequently officially listed as missing in action.</p>
<p>This seemed a daunting request, but nevertheless I submitted it to the North Koreans and having gone through the usual long and tortuous channels I was surprised to receive an invitation to a meeting with senior North Korean military officers to discuss the request. Soon after therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I and my interpreter set off to meet these senior officers at a large military base on the outskirts of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Driving into the base, we stopped at the entrance guard house and I was told to leave my diplomatic vehicle parked there. Then my interpreter and I climbed into a small military vehicle with an officer who my interpreter told me would be our liaison officer for the visit.</p>
<p>The base was huge. We drove past ranks of tanks, armoured vehicles and lorries which appeared to be in pristine (and highly polished) condition. I did learn later that this base was one of several in the Pyongyang garrison that supplied vehicles for the massed televised parades.</p>
<p>A short while later we pulled up outside a large office building. Our liaison officer led us in and up the stairs to a large conference room where sat several high ranking officers. There were also some junior officers milling around as well as a couple of shady looking civilians who never took their eyes off me for the whole meeting. Very disconcerting.</p>
<p>Some commands were rapped out in Korean and everyone sat down. I then outlined my request to them and also provided them with all the relevant information that had been sent to me from the UK. They listened politely. They were very courteous and the atmosphere was more relaxed than I had anticipated. When I had finished my spiel and before they responded to my request, tea was brought in and they all lit up cigarettes. As I drank my tea, they all began a long conversation amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, they said they would investigate this case and get back in touch. So thinking that this was an end to the proceedings, I stood up preparing to leave, but surprisingly no, it was not quite the end. They invited me to have lunch with them, which took me completely off guard.</p>
<p>Before I could respond, another command was rapped out and a series of orderlies wheeled in trollies containing a cold buffet and drink. The buffet was well prepared but the only downside was at the end of the meeting there were several toasts which meant imbibing several shots of the lethal North Korean Soju the after effects of which I did in due course suffer!</p>
<p>So the meeting finally came to an end. I thought that after this first meeting, that would be the end of it. I would get the usual reply back saying this request was not possible to facilitate. The Korean War was something that the North Koreans revered. Museums full of captured allied equipment, films, memorials, statues and posters depicting their glorious victory abounded everywhere. So requesting assistance in finding a hated enemy, albeit a fallen one, was perhaps a request too far.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, no.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, they did get back to me shortly afterwards with some quite startling news. Based on the information I had given them, they had identified the crash site which was close to a village called Kuso-ri/Gueso-ri situated near to what is currently the main airport for Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They had spoken with villagers including two elders who had witnessed the shoot down. Flt Lt Hinton had indeed ejected but his parachute failed and he was killed on impact. The villagers had then interred him in an unmarked grave in a field adjacent to the village. This spot had been identified and human bones and fragments of uniform and aircraft were also uncovered. This scenario is somewhat similar to my previous post <a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/tragic-raf-pilots-secret-grave-discovered-in-albania/">Tragic RAF Pilot’s Secret Grave Discovered In Albania</a></p>
<p>This news then led over the next six months to a long series of meetings, usually weekly either at Army HQ in Pyongyang, the crash site or at a military base on the outskirts of the city chaired on the military side by Senior Colonel Kwak Chol-hui who was to be my main point of contact for this project. I am glad to report that the two shady civilians from our first meeting never did make a reappearance.</p>
<p>The Colonel who would later go on to be promoted to Major General was responsible throughout the negotiations for arranging visits to the site, meetings with the two surviving eyewitnesses and agreeing that Flt Lt Hinton’s brother would be fast tracked for a visa and allowed to visit the DPRK site to pay his final respects to his brother.</p>
<p>True to their word, Flt Lt Hinton’s brother was granted his visa and permitted to visit the village. At a meeting we had with the military, he was offered the choice of having his brother’s remains repatriated to the south via Panmunjon or re-buried on the outskirts of the village. He chose the latter. Therefore, the military re-buried his remains in a properly marked grave and on the final day of his visit, he was part of a small, brief ceremony attended by members of the British Embassy, North Korean military and villagers.</p>
<p>Despite my requests, the North Koreans had refused to allow me to obtain a properly inscribed headstone from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, so a simple marker was used instead. Overall, it was a small victory but did give some form of closure to the family of Flt Lt Hinton.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" alt="Colonel Kwak" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156-1.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156-1.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSCN0156-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></p>
<p>As mentioned above, I met Colonel Kwak Chol-hui (pictured above with me at a Queens Birthday Party celebration in Pyongyang) and his team on many occasions over that 6 month period. As well as working on the Hinton project, he also eased the process of enabling me to take the very rare numbers of visitors we got down to the DMZ at Panmunjon as part of their “North Korean experience”. The other was the USS Pueblo where the military arranged private tours for me (Pueblo post to follow).</p>
<p>At Panmunjon, when I took visitors down to view the DMZ, we were always hosted by the military who would lay on briefings and guides for our visitors as well as a lunch afterwards. I could always see the look of bewilderment on the faces of the South Korean border guards and US military standing a few feet away on the southern side of the demarcation line wondering who these foreigners were on the other side looking a tad too cosy with North Korean officers!</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: In 2011, the remains of Flt Lt Hinton were finally repatriated and in a ceremony at Panmunjon, the remains were passed over to military authorities in the south.</strong></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-640da37223cf5a29f828"><div><p><strong>What's The Story?</strong></p><p>This week the popular Chinese social network, TikTok, is under review by the US Government. The US is looking<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/senate-committee-vote-bill-banning-tiktok-200715190147931.html" target="_blank"> <span>"into potential national security risks as it relates to the app."</span></a>&nbsp; After the announcement, #SaveTikTok and #TikTokBan were trending. The former has 398 million views while the latter has 225 million views. This story isn't just about banning TikTok, but about how bad actors can misdirect our attention.</p><p><strong>Why Did TikTok Capture Attention?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Facebook is for Boomers, Instagram is for Millennials, and TikTok is for Gen-Z. TikTok monthly active users are about 800 million. TikTok's success boils down to a sophisticated AI that drives user engagement. As John Herrman aptly<a href="https://us.hidester.com/proxy.php?u=eJwBQQC%2B%2F3M6NTc6ItRHBViCQ175AXflK6MiidMKJoScGY6323zWCzyFh20oZ0aiWDXKwgv6ANUTHXGL8GpW7G8LKR5UzyI7YrAawQ%3D%3D&amp;b=7&amp;f=norefer" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/style/what-is-tik-tok.html" target="_blank">describes for the NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Imagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you’d friended a single person. That’s TikTok.</em></p></blockquote><p>Taylor Lorenz <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/what-tiktok-is-cringey-and-thats-fine/573871/">writes in the Atlantic</a> what led to the initial success of TikTok:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a world where everyone’s content inevitably begins to look the same, TikTok videos feel bizarre and new. It’s an app full of people posting strange content to the internet with zero self-awareness or shame. That’s easy to mock, but it’s also what may lead to TikTok’s success.</em></p></blockquote><p>I must confess, I go on TikTok and 30-minutes later I’m still on the platform. Each video is as entertaining as the next one. The user experience reminds me of Wikipedia. I remember in middle school spending hours on Wikipedia going from one article to another. I would start by reading about Steve Jobs and end with learning about Peruvian Apple Cactus. There's even a game called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">Wikipedia Game</a> based on this concept. The player must go from Article X to Article Y by only clicking on Wikipedia links.</p><p>I digress.</p><p>But my anecdote serves a purpose. The website kept me on there as long as possible capturing my attention.</p><p>TikTok has captured the attention of not only users but of influencers. David Dobrik, the famed YouTube influencer, exclusively produces videos on TikTok. He hasn't posted a video to YouTube since April 24th. His <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@daviddobrik?lang=en">TikTok page</a> has 19.6M followers about two million more than his YouTube page.</p><p>Established influencers aren't the only ones achieving success on the platform. No name creators go viral overnight. <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/queen-of-alt-tiktok-mooptopia-suddenly-quits-after-rapid-rise-to-fame-1392966">Mooptopia</a>, a TikTok user, went from 1,000 followers to a million followers, to quitting the platform in under two weeks.</p><p>Users and influencers love TikTok. Our government does not.</p><p><strong>What's the Big Picture?</strong></p><p>Most TikTok videos are harmless. There is a video of a<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@britishpromise.cats/video/6839416095586159878?region=PH&amp;mid=6839416100652894982&amp;u_code=d0l05f9835mcjm&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;language=en&amp;_d=dc1ghjb69gikhe&amp;share_item_id=6839416095586159878&amp;timestamp=1592478834&amp;user_id=6572491922367053826&amp;share_app_name=tiktok&amp;share_iid=6817097535460050689&amp;source=h5_t" target="_blank"> <span>cat looking into a cardboard box</span></a> with nearly 200 million views. The platform, however, is not.</p><p>War is evolving. 75 years ago, a nuclear bomb decided the fate of our world. This generation's war won't be fought with bombs, but computers. </p><p>Trump's Oklahoma rally is a prime example. The Trump campaign estimated there would be more than a million attendees at the event. Instead fewer than 10,000 attended.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html" target="_blank"> <span>TikTok users claimed</span></a><span> </span>responsibility. A massive campaign was undertaken on the platform to create fake attendees drawing a blow to the campaign.</p><p>On the surface, this seems like anti-Trump supporters playing a prank. Deep down, the implications are more disturbing. Was this a prank or an "Attention Hack"? Did China hijack the feed to embarrass Trump and the US government?</p><p>I expect the US to ban TikTok. More country specific social media platforms will appear. China has been doing this for years. Facebook is banned in China. Most Chinese citizens use WeChat.</p><p>As fictional President Glenn Walken of the West Wing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Ht_zrRi5A">remarked</a>, "We live in the real world. Our moral value systems only work if everyone plays by the same rules." Expect social media platforms to become one of the battlegrounds in the fight for attention.</p><p><strong>What Are the Lessons For Your Brand?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Don't rely on one platform. This has been a lesson discussed for years. Zynga, famously,<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2016/06/30/facebook-kicked-zynga-to-the-curb-publishers-are-next/" target="_blank"> relied on Facebook</a> for its users. That relationship abruptly ended in 2012 and Zynga has been recovering ever since.</p></li><li><p>Pay attention to policy issues. TikTok has been a point of contention for a while among federal policymakers. Brands must do their due diligence before deciding to create content on a platform.</p></li></ol></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of July 2020, the social media world was taken by surprise. Official accounts of major celebrities on Twitter, a platform with over 330 million monthly users, were hacked to perpetuate a Bitcoin scam. This Twitter hack involved accounts that have millions of followers and were verified. This includes accounts of Elon Musk, Apple, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama, Mike Bloomberg, etc.</p><p>The hackers tweeted from these official accounts asking fans and followers of the hacked celebrities to send bitcoin to specific wallet addresses with the promise of doubling it and sending back. Specifically, most of the tweets requested for $1,000 and then promised to send back $2,000. So many Twitter users and followers of these accounts fell for the scam and the stolen amount of bitcoin is said to be equivalent to over $100,000.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=640%2C407&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="407" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/960x0.jpg?resize=640%2C407&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>From findings, this hack attack was well-planned and the hackers manage to gain internal access to Twitter’s system. Once in, they took control over verified accounts and accounts with millions of followers to launch the Bitcoin scam. Hours into the hack, Twitter reacted via its support handle stating that they were aware of the situation of things.</p><p>While they investigate and look for a resolution, Twitter users were advised to reset their passwords and some other account functionalities. At some point, accounts of some users, mostly verified users, were limited from tweeting on the social media platform.</p><p>Bitcoin scams are not new on Twitter but this happens to be the biggest and most successful in years. Tweeting from different official and verified handles at the same time is enough to convince oblivious users into transferring their Bitcoin. With the decentralization and blockchain technology of Bitcoin, tracking the identity of the hacker via the public wallet address has been fruitless.</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a href="https://secureblitz.com/the-must-dos-and-donts-for-protecting-your-password-and-personal-data/">The Must Dos And Don’ts For Protecting Your Password And Personal Data</a></strong></p><p>However, an unconfirmed update from an unverified Twitter user (@inteldotwav) revealed the hacker to be Samuel Hyde, an ex-developer at Twitter. Twitter is yet to officially respond to this claim.</p><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=441%2C632&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="441" height="632" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?w=441&amp;ssl=1 441w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=209%2C300&amp;ssl=1 209w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2.jpg?resize=441%2C632&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p><p>If the hack is an inside job as the tweet claims, then, the security lapse is not a fault on the victim’s part. As a Twitter user, protecting your account to avoid being a victim of a hack like this is important. Twitter features <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">2-factor-authentication</a> which is very ideal for account protection as it adds an extra layer of security to your login. Going back to basics, your password should be very secure with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</p><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="https://secureblitz.com/author/johnray/" title="John Raymond"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="John Raymond" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>John Raymond is an author, writer, and scriptwriter.

<p>Last week, during my weekly one-on-one with Jordan (a young sales rep), he asked me about a momentous life decision.</p>



<p>“Should I move back to the Bay Area or move to Denver?” Jordan moved back home after COVID-19 struck and was weighing his options about where to move to next.</p>



<p>My response: Don’t move to Denver if you care about your career.</p>



<p>His question was less about Denver and more about properly evaluating opportunity costs. Denver’s cost of living is astronomically lower than San Francisco’s. Plus, COVID-19 has rendered locations obsolete. You no longer need to be in the Bay Area because the virus has democratized access to tech jobs. Right?</p>



<p>Wrong!</p>



<p>The permanent shift to Remote Work is the most overhyped thing since Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Sure, COVID has caused more people to work remotely than ever before. But, central locations where people can meet in-person and collaborate will never vanish. I was on a call with a VP at Salesforce last week and he could not wait to get the hell out of his house. </p>



<p>According to Paul Graham, “One of the biggest things lost in remote work is chance meetings.”</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know about the power of chance meetings because Y Combinator is explicitly designed to magnify it. Whenever YC brings together any group of more than about 4 founders for any reason, there ends up being an important conversation between some pair of them.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1270626376165527553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Similarly, Steve Jobs designed Pixar’s Headquarters to drive spontaneous conversations. In Walter Isaacson’s book, Jobs says “There’s a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat. That’s crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”</p>



<p>This type of thinking is not exclusive to Y-Combinator and Apple. Serendipity has birthed countless groundbreaking companies in the Bay Area. Like the chance encounter that led to the first major investment in Facebook. Zuck and his crew were kickin’ it in the mean streets of Palo Alto when they ran into Sean Parker, who introduced them to Peter Thiel. He invested $500,000 in the social network. Facebook is now valued at $700 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c0c/046/73d166a28d470935ed0166d32f24bb1731-23-peter-thiel-mark-zuckerberg.2x.rhorizontal.w700.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="446"><figcaption><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html">https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/is-peter-thiel-playing-mark-zuckerberg.html</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.saastr.com/maybe-80-of-public-saas-companies-are-in-the-sf-bay-area/">80% of all public SaaS companies are headquartered in the Bay Area</a>. COVID has been a boon for these businesses. Have you seen the recent valuations of Zoom, Okta, Crowdstrike, and Twilio? Where do you think most of the executives at these companies live? Chances are they will propel the next wave of hypergrowth SaaS companies right here in the Bay Area. Don’t believe me?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Georg Kurtz was at McAfee before he founded CrowdStrike. Todd McKinnon led development at Salesforce before he founded Okta. Eric Yuan was the VP of Engineering at Cisco before starting Zoom.&nbsp;This is the power of being in the Bay Area. If San Francisco is the Lebron James of tech, Denver is Brian Scalabrine. </p>



<figure><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lebron-1.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="320"><figcaption><a href="https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-brian-scalabrine-believes-lebron-james-cavs-prepared-for-spurs-instead-of-warriors-in-2014-15-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://clutchpoints.com/nba-news-brian-scalabrine-believes-lebron-james-cavs-prepared-for-spurs-instead-of-warriors-in-2014-15-season/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>I told Jordan that Denver is more expensive than the Bay Area if he properly factors in the opportunity cost of not living in a city that would give him 10,000x the opportunities.</p>



<p>Which brings me to Short-term vs. Long-term thinking.</p>



<p>I wish someone would’ve hammered this into my brain when I was younger. When you’re in your early 20’s, your biggest asset is time. You have lots of it and can leverage the power of compounding to achieve your wildest dreams. This is why you should strictly optimize for the long-term.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“If you’re going to invent, it means you’re going to experiment, so you have to think long-term.”</p><p>Jeff Bezos</p></blockquote>



<p>Long-term compounding gives you the most leverage when it’s applied to things like investing and learning, not penny-pinching. Choosing to move to Denver instead of the Bay Area is optimizing for the cost of living which is the textbook definition of short-term thinking. Now, if Jordan had a family to support, I would be more empathetic to his contemplation of Denver over San Francisco. But, he didn’t. Call me an elitist, but if you want to have a wildly successful career in tech, saving $500 or $1000 a month on rent won’t mean shit in the long run. Especially, if the opportunity cost eradicates those savings which in Jordan’s case it would.</p>



<p>One of the best examples of long-term thinking can be found by studying business mogul Dhirubhai Ambani.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/mrobackend/assets/uploads/dhirubhai-ambani.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="251"><figcaption><a href="https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/">https://www.mrobusinesstoday.com/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="http://doerlife.com/dhirubhai-ambani-on-networking/">He had a habit of visiting the Taj hotel</a> for a cup of tea in the evenings. But, his friends refused to join him. They thought the tea there was overpriced. After all, he was paying close to $50 for a cup of tea (at that time), whereas they would get the same tea down the road for $5. Was he out of his mind? $45 a day can add up. When they asked him about his crazy habit, he said:&nbsp;“I’m paying five bucks for the tea and another 45 bucks because the Taj gives me the opportunity to connect with the city’s most influential people.”</p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking. The world has changed. Twitter allows me to connect with anyone, anywhere in the world. I don’t need to pay for overpriced tea to have access to the most influential people. Sure. But, if you’re interested in building a successful career in tech, nothing comes close to sitting down for a cup of coffee with another founder, or VP even if you have to sit on a patio and wear facemasks. Don’t feel bad for paying a premium to access the best opportunities in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s in our nature to overreact. Unexpected changes to our lives lead us to believe that the world will never be the same.</p>



<p>When I was living in Los Angeles, I remember the night Trump sealed his victory over Hillary. I was at a birthday party, which started to feel like a funeral when two of my girlfriends started bawling their eyes out. One of my buddies said he was going to liquidate his stocks because we were headed for an epic crash. After all, Trump was unstable and there was nothing the markets hated more than instability. On top of that, people all over the internet were threatening to pack up their stuff and move to Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I see our reaction to COVID through the same lens. People are overreacting to the long term changes caused by it. Has it shifted work culture to a hybrid model where you can work from anywhere? Yes. And, that’s great. If anything, It’s made humanity more resilient and to bet against human ingenuity is foolish. We’ve solved harder problems in the past and we will solve COVID.</p>



<p>Do you think people are just going to Netflix and chill and order DoorDash for the rest of their lives? That would be a sad existence. Most people I know love nothing more than spending their hard-earned dollars on experiences. And, I’m not talking about VR. </p>

<p>There’s too much money on the line for us to not figure this out. My fiancé and I just pushed our wedding to next year, which means we also pushed our honeymoon. No one is going to settle for Zoom weddings or staycation honeymoons. Even if that’s the only reason we solve COVID, we will either come up with a cure or beat this virus when everyone understands the ROI of masks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we do, the streets of SoMa are going to be bustling once again with people in Patagonia vests skipping over human feces in their Allbirds on their way to the office.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t move to Denver</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If you’re early in your career and want to take advantage of the best opportunities in tech, there’s no place like the Bay Area. Take advantage of the same serendipity that introduced&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg to Peter Thiel.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The fastest-growing SaaS companies are here. Executives at these companies will start the next wave of hypergrowth companies just like when Todd McKinnon left Salesforce to start Okta.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Don’t be a short-term thinker. Pay the premium to access the best opportunities in the world. You won’t be thinking about the $1000 a month you could’ve saved if you had just played it safe in your 20’s. As the saying goes, “you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” The quality of talent in the Bay Area will be the forcing mechanism you need to reach your full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Lastly, overreacting can have serious consequences. <a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/06/16/one-fifth-of-investors-sold-all-their-stocks/">18% of all Fidelity account owners</a> dumped all of their stock between February and May. They thought the world was going to end and missed one of the most epic stock markets rebounds in history. Don’t do that. </li></ul>



<p>We will beat COVID. And, when we do, a chance meeting in San Francisco can lead to the biggest opportunity of your career.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For the Dashbit website, we wanted to avoid tracking users as much as possible. This means no cookies and unfortunately most analytics use cookies for tracking and/or fingerprinting. However, we still want to see which pages on our website are being frequently accessed. For this purpose, we have decided to roll our own analytics system.</p>
<p>
In this article, we will cover how we implemented the analytics system with Ecto upserts and how we have used the Elixir registry and Elixir processes to reduce the pressure on the database.</p>
<h2>
Tracking with upserts</h2>
<p>
The idea is very simple: every time someone accesses a page, we will store this information in the database. However, we don’t need to track each access at the instant they happen. For us, tracking how many accesses a page had in a day is completely fine. Therefore, every time a page is accessed on a given date, we will attempt to insert an entry in the database. If an entry already exists, we update its counter instead.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this can be done with an upsert in Ecto. Let’s first define the schema for the database resource:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>MyApp.Metrics.Metric</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Schema</span><span>

  </span><span>@primary_key</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>
  </span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>"metrics"</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
    </span><span>field</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6781915709-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="6781915709-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
It has three fields: a date, the page path, and the counter (number of accesses). The date and path make a composite primary key. Our migration looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Repo.Migrations.CreateMetrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Ecto.Migration</span><span>

  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>change</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span data-group-id="1237551938-3">(</span><span>:metrics</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span data-group-id="1237551938-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-4">do</span><span>
      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:date</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>primary_key</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
      </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>:counter</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-4">end</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1237551938-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="1237551938-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Now we execute the following command whenever we want to count one page access:</p>
<pre><code><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="9701504210-1">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="9701504210-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="9701504210-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="9701504210-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The code above performs an upsert, incrementing the number of accesses in a page by the value of <code>counter</code>, which is typically 1. If an entry does not exist, one is immediately created.</p>
<p>
This is the core of our analytics. It is a very straight-forward solution, but it does have a strong requirement on the database accepting all of our writes. While most applications heavily rely on a database, the analytics system is the only place in our website that uses a database, so we believe it is important to show an article, such as this blog post, even if there is an error when talking to the storage layer. To address this, we have decided to move the upserts to separate processes.</p>
<h2>
Async and batched writes with processes</h2>
<p>
As laid out in the previous section, we want to move all the database writes done by our analytics code to a separate process. Another concern we have with our solution so far is how it will handle overloads. If there is a huge spike in traffic, could we end up putting too much pressure in the database? In this sense, would it be a good idea to batch our writes?</p>
<p>
To be honest, our application will be just fine with spikes. Most of our page loads are within hundreds of microseconds, thanks to Phoenix, and our database usage is minimal. On the other hand, such a small project is a perfect opportunity to experiment, so we decided to explore how our analytics solution would look like if we performed writes asynchronously and in batches.</p>
<p>
Here is what we came up with. Every time a user accesses a page, we will spawn an Elixir process that tracks all accesses to that page. If a process already exists for said page, we will message the existing process instead. The goal of this process is to collect all accesses within a time interval, writing to the database after X seconds.</p>
<p>
We are going to call this the <code>Worker</code> process and it starts like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5734826703-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>GenServer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>restart</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:temporary</span></code></pre>
<p>
We define a module for the process and declare it as a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html"><code>GenServer</code></a>. We also say that this process is <code>:temporary</code>. I.e. if it dies, we don’t want the supervisor to restart it. That’s because we are assuming that, if the process dies, our logic that dynamically spawns processes for each page will eventually start a new one anyway.</p>
<p>
Next we define the <code>init</code> callback of the process:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span>Process</span><span>.</span><span>flag</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">(</span><span>:trap_exit</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-3">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_counter</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-5">}</span><span data-group-id="1587488502-4">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1587488502-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>init</code> callback traps exits and sets the process state to <code>{path, 0}</code>. The first element is the page path, the second element is the number of page visits.</p>
<p>
Our process should be able to receive a <code>:bump</code> message. This message is sent whenever we need to bump the counter and is handled by the <code>handle_info</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-2">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">do</span><span>
    </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-4">(</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-4">)</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-5">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-6">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-6">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-5">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-3">end</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-7">(</span><span>:bump</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-8">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-8">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-7">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">do</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-10">{</span><span>:noreply</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-11">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-11">}</span><span data-group-id="7044761336-10">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="7044761336-9">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If we receive the <code>:bump</code> when the page had no access (i.e. counter is zero), we will bump the counter to 1 and we will also schedule an upsert event, so we eventually write those accesses to the database. If the counter is more than 0, we simply bump it and return an updated state.</p>
<p>
The scheduling and upsert code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>schedule_upsert</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">(</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-2">end</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>handle_info</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-6">(</span><span>:upsert</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-7">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-7">}</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-6">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-8">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-8">end</span><span>

  </span><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-12">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="6238594391-12">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">do</span><span>
    </span><span># same function as the previous section</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="6238594391-13">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>schedule_upsert()</code> function schedules a message to the current process (<code>self()</code>). The message will be named <code>:upsert</code> and it will be delivered in a random value between 10s to 20s. The reason we picked a random value is to avoid a scenario where multiple processes for different pages are spawned at the same time and they all write to the database at the same time.</p>
<p>
Next we define another <code>handle_info</code> clause, this time to handle the scheduled <code>:upsert</code> message. This clause simply invokes the <code>upsert!</code> function, defined in the previous section, and resets the state back to <code>{path, 0}</code>. This makes it so that, once there is a new bump, we will schedule a new upsert.</p>
<p>
Finally, we implement the <code>terminate</code> callback, which will be invoked whenever our application is shutting down:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">{</span><span>_path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-2">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:ok</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>terminate</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">(</span><span>_</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">{</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-4">}</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-3">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>upsert!</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">(</span><span>path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>counter</span><span data-group-id="1299229119-5">)</span><span>
</span><span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>
If our application is shutting down, we may have pending writes in our worker, so we want to send them to the database as part of our termination logic. One important thing to remember is that the <code>terminate</code> callback is not called by default when shutting down, unless you are trapping exits. That’s why we called <code>Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)</code> in the <code>init</code> function.</p>
<p>
The process we just implemented delivers all of the requirements we have so far: writes are now asynchronous, as they happen in a separate process, and they are also batched, using intervals between 10s and 20s. The last step we need to implement is to actually spawn those processes on the fly as users navigate through the website.</p>
<h2>
Dynamic processes with the Elixir registry</h2>
<p>
In order to spawn and find processes for each page, we are going to use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Registry.html">Elixir’s <code>Registry</code></a>. We also need a dynamic supervisor which is going to be the parent of all worker processes. Let’s implement this logic in the overaching <code>Metrics</code> module, alongside our <code>bump(page)</code> function.</p>
<p>
Let’s get started with the basics:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8546136914-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>Supervisor</span><span>

  </span><span>@worker</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Worker</span><span>
  </span><span>@registry</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.Registry</span><span>
  </span><span>@supervisor</span><span> </span><span>Dashbit.Metrics.WorkerSupervisor</span></code></pre>
<p>
Our <code>Dashbit.Metrics</code> module is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html"><code>Supervisor</code></a>, which will have two children: the registry and the supervisor of all workers. Since the workers are started dynamically, as requests come, we will use a <code>DynamicSupervisor</code>. We store the names of the worker, registry and dynamic supervisor processes in module attributes for convenience.</p>
<p>
Next we will define how our supervisor is started and its <code>init</code> callback:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>start_link</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">(</span><span>_opts</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-2">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-2">end</span><span>

  </span><span>@impl</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-4">(</span><span>:ok</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-4">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-5">do</span><span>
    </span><span>children</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-6">[</span><span>
      </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-7">{</span><span>Registry</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>keys</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:unique</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>@registry</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-7">}</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-8">{</span><span>DynamicSupervisor</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>@supervisor</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>strategy</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:one_for_one</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-8">}</span><span>
    </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-6">]</span><span>

    </span><span>Supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-9">(</span><span>children</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>strategy</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:one_for_all</span><span data-group-id="8570317183-9">)</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8570317183-5">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
With the registry and dynamic supervisor in place, we can write the bump function:</p>
<pre><code><span>  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>bump</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-1">)</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>is_binary</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">(</span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-3">do</span><span>

          </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>DynamicSupervisor</span><span>.</span><span>start_child</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-9">(</span><span>@supervisor</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-10">{</span><span>@worker</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>path</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-10">}</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-9">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-11">do</span><span>

    </span><span>send</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-15">(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:bump</span><span data-group-id="1140714578-15">)</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="1140714578-3">end</span><span>
</span><span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The <code>bump</code> function looks up in the registry if there is a process for the given path and returns its process identifier (<code>pid</code>). If one does not exist, we ask the worker supervisor to start a worker dynamically. We expect two possible outcomes from <code>start_child</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:ok, pid}</code> - the worker was started    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<code>{:error, {:already_started, pid}}</code> - a worker for the given <code>path</code> already exists    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We need the second branch to address a potential race condition where two users may access a page for the first time at the same time. In this scenario, the <code>Registry.lookup/2</code> will fail for both them, and both will attempt to spawn the worker. One of them will succeed and the other will return the “already started” error. Once we find the <code>pid</code>, we send it the <code>:bump</code> message.</p>
<p>
We are almost there. There are just two steps left. …</p></article></div></div>

<br><h3>Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler, part 1</h3><p><small>5/5/2020</small></p><p>

<img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/knightdragon.jpg"></p><p><i>This is the first post in a three part series. Check out <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html">part 3</a> when you are ready.</i></p>

<p>It is a beautiful day outside, so let's make a compiler. You don't need any knowledge of how compilers work to follow along. We are going to use Python to implement our own programming language, Teeny Tiny, that will compile to C code. It will take about 500 lines of code and provide the initial infrastructure needed to customize and extend the compiler into your own billion dollar production-ready compiler.</p>

<p>This tutorial is a series of posts that go step by step in building a working compiler. All of the source code can be found in the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AZHenley/teenytinycompiler">repo</a>. If you follow along with all the posts, I guesstimate that it will take you only a few hours.

</p><p>The Teeny Tiny language we are going to implement is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. The syntax is clean and simple. If you prefer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>-like syntax then it will be trivial to modify the compiler at the end.  Here is an example program in our Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<pre>PRINT "How many fibonacci numbers do you want?"
INPUT nums

LET a = 0
LET b = 1
WHILE nums &gt; 0 REPEAT
    PRINT a
    LET c = a + b
    LET a = b
    LET b = c
    LET nums = nums - 1
ENDWHILE	
</pre>

<p>This program prints out terms of the fibonacci sequence based on the user's input: 0 1 1 2 3 5 13...</p>

<p>Our language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it will support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerical variables</li>
	<li>Basic arithmetic</li>
	<li>If statements</li>
	<li>While loops</li>
	<li>Print text and numbers</li>
	<li>Input numbers</li>
	<li>Labels and goto</li>

<p>Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. It will also setup the compiler in such a way that many other features will be straight forward to add later.</p>

<h4>Compiler Overview</h4>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/compilersteps.png"></p><p>Our compiler will follow a three step process that is illustrated above. First, given the inputted source code, it will break the code up into <i>tokens</i>. These are like words and punctuation in English. Second, it will <i>parse</i> the tokens to make sure they are in an order that is allowed in our language. Just like English sentences follow specific structures of verbs and nouns. Third, it will <i>emit</i> the C code that our language will translate to.</p>

<p>We will use these three steps as the main organization for our code. The lexer, parser, and emitter will each have their own Python code file. This tutorial is broken up into 3 parts based on these steps as well. If you were to extend the compiler, there are some additional steps you would add, but we will hold off on discussing those.</p>



<h4>Lexer Overview</h4>

<p>The first module of our compiler is called the <i>lexer</i>. Given a string of Teeny Tiny code, it will iterate character by character to do two things: decide where each token starts/stops and what type of token it is. If the lexer is unable to do this, then it will report an error for an invalid token.</p>

<p><img src="http://austinhenley.com/blog/images/tokens.png"></p><p>The figure demonstrates an example input and output of the lexer. Given the Teeny Tiny code, the lexer must determine where the tokens are along with the type (e.g., keyword). You can see that spaces aren't recognized as tokens, but the lexer will use them as one way to know when a token ends.</p>

<p>Let's finally get into some code, starting with the structure of the lexer in the file <b>lex.py</b>:</p>

<pre>class Lexer:
    def __init__(self, input):
        pass

    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        pass

    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        pass

    # Invalid token found, print error message and exit.
    def abort(self, message):
        pass
		
    # Skip whitespace except newlines, which we will use to indicate the end of a statement.
    def skipWhitespace(self):
        pass
		
    # Skip comments in the code.
    def skipComment(self):
        pass

    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        pass
</pre>

<p>I like to sketch out all the functions that I think I will need, then go back and fill them in. The function <b>getToken</b> will be the meat of the lexer. It will be called each time the compiler is ready for the next token and it will do the work of classifying tokens. <b>nextChar</b> and <b>peek</b> are helper functions for looking at the next character. <b>skipWhitespace</b> consumes the spaces and tabs that we don't care about. <b>abort</b> is what we will use to report an invalid token.</p>

<p>The lexer needs to keep track of the current position in the input string and the character at that position. We will initialize these in the constructor:</p>

<pre>    def __init__(self, input):
        self.source = input + '\n' # Source code to lex as a string. Append a newline to simplify lexing/parsing the last token/statement.
        self.curChar = ''   # Current character in the string.
        self.curPos = -1    # Current position in the string.
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>The lexer needs the input code and we append a newline to it (this just simplifies some checks later on). <b>curChar</b> is what the lexer will constantly check to decide what kind of token it is. Why not just do <i>source[curPos]</i>? Because that would litter the code with bounds checking. Instead we do this in <b>nextChar</b>:</p>

<pre>    # Process the next character.
    def nextChar(self):
        self.curPos += 1
        if self.curPos &gt;= len(self.source):
            self.curChar = '\0'  # EOF
        else:
            self.curChar = self.source[self.curPos]
</pre>

<p>This increments the lexer's current position and updates the current character. If we reach the end of the input, set the character to the end-of-file marker. This is the only place we will modify curPos and curChar. But sometimes we want to look ahead to the next character without updating curPos:</p>

<pre>    # Return the lookahead character.
    def peek(self):
        if self.curPos + 1 &gt;= len(self.source):
            return '\0'
        return self.source[self.curPos+1]
</pre>

<p>We should make sure these functions work. Let's test them by create a new file <b>teenytiny.py</b>:</p>

<pre>from lex import *

def main():
	input = "LET foobar = 123"
	lexer = Lexer(input)

	while lexer.peek() != '\0':
		print(lexer.curChar)
		lexer.nextChar()

main()
</pre>

<p>Run this and the output should be every character of the input string, <i>LET foobar = 123</i>, on a new line:</p>

<pre>L
E 
T 

f 
o 
o 
b 
a 
r 

= 

1 
2 
3 

</pre>

<h4>Classifying Tokens</h4>

<p>But we don't just want characters, we want tokens! We need to plan how combining individual characters together makes a token, which works much like a state machine. Here are the main lexer rules for the Teeny Tiny language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operator. One or two consecutive characters that matches: + - * / = == != &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;=</li>
	<li>String. Double quotation followed by zero or more characters and a double quotation. Such as: "hello, world!" and ""</li>
	<li>Number. One or more numeric characters followed by an optional decimal point and one or more numeric characters. Such as: 15 and 3.14</li>
	<li>Identifier. An alphabetical character followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
	<li>Keyword. Exact text match of: LABEL, GOTO, PRINT, INPUT, LET, IF, THEN, ENDIF, WHILE, REPEAT, ENDWHILE</li>
</ul>

<p>Next we will start our <b>getToken</b> function in our <b>Lexer</b> class:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            pass	# Plus token.
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            pass	# Minus token.
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            pass	# Asterisk token.
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            pass	# Slash token.
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            pass	# Newline token.
        elif self.curChar == '\0':
            pass	# EOF token.
        else:
            # Unknown token!
            pass
			
        self.nextChar()
</pre>

<p>This will detect a few possible tokens, but doesn't do anything useful yet. What we need next is a <b>Token</b> class to keep track of what type of token it is and the exact text from the code. Place this in <b>Lex.py</b> for now:</p>

<pre># Token contains the original text and the type of token.
class Token:   
    def __init__(self, tokenText, tokenKind):
        self.text = tokenText   # The token's actual text. Used for identifiers, strings, and numbers.
        self.kind = tokenKind   # The TokenType that this token is classified as.
</pre>

<p>To specify what type a token is, we will create the <b>TokenType</b> class as an enum. It looks long, but it just specifies every possible token our language allows. Add <i>import enum</i> to the top of <b>Lex.py</b> and add this class:</p>

<pre># TokenType is our enum for all the types of tokens.
class TokenType(enum.Enum):
	EOF = -1
	NEWLINE = 0
	NUMBER = 1
	IDENT = 2
	STRING = 3
	# Keywords.
	LABEL = 101
	GOTO = 102
	PRINT = 103
	INPUT = 104
	LET = 105
	IF = 106
	THEN = 107
	ENDIF = 108
	WHILE = 109
	REPEAT = 110
	ENDWHILE = 111
	# Operators.
	EQ = 201  
	PLUS = 202
	MINUS = 203
	ASTERISK = 204
	SLASH = 205
	EQEQ = 206
	NOTEQ = 207
	LT = 208
	LTEQ = 209
	GT = 210
	GTEQ = 211
</pre>

<p>Now we can expand <b>getToken</b> to actually do something when it detects a specific token:</p>

<pre>    # Return the next token.
    def getToken(self):
        token = None

        # Check the first character of this token to see if we can decide what it is.
        # If it is a multiple character operator (e.g., !=), number, identifier, or keyword then we will process the rest.
        if self.curChar == '+':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.PLUS)
        elif self.curChar == '-':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.MINUS)
        elif self.curChar == '*':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.ASTERISK)
        elif self.curChar == '/':
            token = Token(self.curChar, TokenType.SLASH)
        elif self.curChar == '\n':
            token = …</pre></div></div></div>

                </i>
              </p>
              
          </div>
          <p>A <a href="https://www.baybridgebio.com/blog/young_founders_1.html">previous post</a> showed that, historically, young CEOs are capable of building very successful biotech <sup>2</sup> companies.  If that’s the case, why do so few young biotech CEOs get funded today?</p>
          <p>There are many valid reasons for preferring experienced CEOs: they are used to the level of rigor of industrial science, have experience managing drug discovery programs, understand the drug discovery and development process, have extensive networks, have experience with FDA, and have a nose for commercially viable science.</p>
          <p>There are also many valid reasons for preferring younger CEOs: they are closer to the latest science and technology, they are less constrained by conventional ways of thinking, and they bring fresh perspectives, optimism and ambition.</p>
          <p>Some companies, like asset-centric virtual startups, are probably best run by experienced CEOs.  But young, technical CEOs are probably well suited to build the next gene editing or synthetic biology platform.</p>
          <p>Both experienced and inexperienced entrepreneurs have strengths and weaknesses.  But the industry today seems to disproportionately emphasize the virtues of experience and undervalue the virtues of youth.  The industry is structured to turbocharge the strengths of experienced entrepreneurs and build support systems to complement their weaknesses.  But there don't seem to be as many groups that put young technical founders front-and-center, and build support systems to compensate for their lack of experience and networks.</p>
          <p>Why is this?  I hypothesize that the industry’s current preference for experienced CEOs is a rational response to the “dark ages” of the late 1990s and 2000s, one of the most challenging environments ever for biotech VC and pharma R&amp;D (the industry seems to have emerged from this period, and that's the topic of the next post):</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Eroom's Law</b> put the cost of developing a drug out of reach of cash-strapped startups.</li>
              <li>A <b>conservative FDA</b> was approving fewer new drugs, and big companies were better able to absorb regulatory risk than were startups.</li>
              <li>The breakthrough technologies of the turn of the century – gene and cell therapy 1.0, antisense therapy, the sequencing of the human genome – that could have fueled the next wave of startups proved to be more <b>hype than reality</b> <sup>3</sup>.</li>
              <li>The <b>exit environment was challenging</b>, so it was hard for biotech venture investors to make money.</li>
              <li>The "low-hanging fruit" of drug discovery was picked, and as discovery projects became more complex, skilled managers increased in importance relative to highly productive individual contributors.</li>
              <li>Investors became more risk-averse in response to these challenges.  <b>Investors reduced “management risk” by not funding young CEOs</b>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Another unfortunate side effect of this challenging time was that an entire generation of would-be entrepreneurs, investors and industry scientists never got training in industrial biotech or exposure to how science-based companies were built.  Pharma was cutting R&amp;D, biotech companies weren’t taking big science risk, and investors were abandoning biotech.  This depleted the stock of promising young scientists with industry training -- the exact kind of person you'd hope to fund as an entrepreneur.</p>

          <br>
          <h3>Biotech's "dark age"</h3>
          <p>The period from the late 1970s to early 1990s was a boom time for biotech startups, with startups like Genentech, Amgen and Biogen using recombinant DNA technology to create a whole new class of medicines.  These startups, initially viewed as crazy by established pharma companies, ultimately reshaped the industry.  This “golden age of molecular biology” peaked in the 1980s and saw the creation of many large and lasting companies.</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/founding_date_valuation.png"></p><p>The period from 1995 to today was a different story.  Only six $10B+ biotherapeutics companies have been started since 1995 (Actelion, BioMarin, Pharmasset, Seattle Genetics, Kite and Juno), and only two have been started since 2000 (Kite and Juno).  Of course, it takes time for these companies to grow to such valuations, so there are probably some companies founded recently that will get to that level in time (Alnylam is nearly at a $10B market cap and was founded in 2002; John Maragone, the first CEO, was 38 at the time).  But compared to the 1970s and 1980s, the 1990s and 2000s were a challenging time for ambitious biotech startups and their investors.</p>
          <p>Why was this period so challenging?</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Declining R&amp;D productivity and "Eroom's Law"</h3>
          <p>A major driver of the struggles of biotech and pharma was, and continues to be, ever-decreasing returns to R&amp;D investment.  The number of approved drugs per dollar of R&amp;D spent is on a steady, long-term decline (chart from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681">Scannell et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2012</a>):</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/erooms_nature_2012.png"></p><p>This phenomenon is “Eroom’s Law” (“Moore’s Law” backwards): the cost of developing a drug increases exponentially over time, despite dramatic improvements in efficiency at various steps of the drug development process (some of these efficiency gains approximating Moore’s Law) <sup>4</sup>.</p>
          <p>This drop in R&amp;D productivity, combined with the <a href="https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/drug-patent-expirations-and-the-patent-cliff">“patent cliff”</a> where a huge wave of blockbuster drugs all lost patent protection within a few years, led to the first ever year of <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/behold-patent-cliff-u-s-drug-market-shrinks-for-first-time">declining US revenue</a> for the pharma industry in 2012.  Pharma companies responded to these challenges with <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2011/12/pharma-industry-crisis">massive layoffs</a>: some estimated that <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2013/02/18/biotech-pharma-whining-about-talent-should-look-in-the-mirror/">150,000 pharma employees were laid off from 2009-2012</a>.  These layoffs, combined with a general investor retreat from biotech, made it very difficult for young scientists to get training in the business of building and investing in science-driven companies.</p>
          <p>The point of all this is that by the 2000s, drug development had become more expensive than the industry had anticipated, and you couldn’t take a drug from bench to bedside on a startup or academic budget.  So startups focused on less expensive, <a href="https://xconomy.com/national/2012/07/02/whos-still-active-among-the-early-stage-biotech-vcs/">later-stage</a> projects, like reformulations / repurposing, orphan drugs, or lower-risk development plans.  These were not the kinds of projects that would become $10B+ companies.</p>
          <p>A corollary to this is that as the low-hanging fruit was picked, companies had to work harder for new drugs (as mentioned in the opening quote of this paper).  In the early days of biotech, a few smart, dedicated scientists could make a drug.  Genentech's first products were recombinant versions of proteins that were already known to be therapeutic, and that were relatively simple to clone.  After that, they had to tackle targets with less well-understood biology, or create drugs with more complex structures.  As complexity grew, research teams grew in size, and the importance of experienced managers increased in relation to highly productive individual contributors.</p>
          <p>Around the turn of the century, new technologies like antisense therapy, gene therapy, cell therapy and genomic medicine promised to create new therapeutic white space that nimble startups were well-suited to explore.  Unfortunately, these technologies did not prove ready for prime time.  The first gene therapies, engineered cell therapies and antisense therapies were approved by FDA just in the last few years, despite significant hype around these technologies as far back as the 1990s.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Fewer FDA Approvals</h3>
          <p>Simultaneously, FDA was approving fewer new drugs (chart from <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-approvals/new-drug-approvals-fall-to-six-year-low-in-2016-idUKKBN14M08R">Reuters</a>).</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/fda_approvals_1993_to_2017.png"></p><p>During the 2000s, FDA was approving roughly half the number of drugs per year as it has been since ~2012.  While FDA issues certainly affected big pharma as well as startups, an FDA delay could easily kill a startup, while big companies could generally absorb the blow.</p>
          <p>Part of this may have been a function of declining R&amp;D productivity (ie pharma was not submitting as many quality drugs for approval, so fewer would be approved; I don’t have data on FDA approval rates going back decades), but FDA anecdotally seemed more conservative during the 2000s than today (understandably, given things like Vioxx’s undisclosed cardiovascular risks and patient deaths).</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Challenging exit environment compressing VC returns</h3>
          <p>The 2000s was also a tough decade for IPOs and M&amp;A.  In order for investors and entrepreneurs to make money, startups need to “exit”: typically by either selling the startup to a bigger company, or “going public” through an IPO, allowing them to sell stock to the public.  If the IPO and M&amp;A markets are not accommodating, it can be very hard for investors to make money.</p>
          
          <p>Biotech IPOs per year (from <a href="https://www.mtspartners.com/news/the-mts-biotech-ipo-monitor-edition-4-q3-2018-update-2018-looking-to-beat-the-2014-high-tide-mark-for-biotech-ipos/">MTS Partners</a>)</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/biotech_ipos_historically.png"></p><p>After a booming period from 1991-2000 that saw an average of 30 biotech IPOs a year (including the outlier year 2000), the decade from 2001-2010 saw IPOs fall to a third of that level <sup>5</sup>.  For most of the 2000s, an IPO was not a realistic possibility for most companies.</p>
          <p>Pharma M&amp;A activity was healthier than the IPO market in the 2000s-2010s, but compared to today, valuations were lower, and pharma typically only spent big money on late stage assets (chart from <a href="https://lifescivc.com/2016/09/saluting-biotech-ma-onward-upward/">Bruce Booth / LifeSciVC blog</a>).</p>
          <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/acq_by_stage_over_time.png"></p><p>In an environment where the average M&amp;A value for a Phase 3 company was only $340M, and …</p></div></div>

<h3>How Can a SaaS Company Stand Out in a Saturated Market?</h3>
<p>There is only one way your SaaS company can stand out successfully in this fiercely competitive environment. You have to develop a shrewd marketing strategy and implement it using the latest tools and techniques, all tailored to your unique business, products, prospects, and customers. This means understanding the powerful impact of <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/inbound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">inbound marketing</a> for SaaS and making sure everyone in your organization is on board, from marketing to sales, C-suite, product development, and customer success.</p>
<p>The simplest way to understand Inbound is the concept of the flywheel. Rather than the traditional sales funnel that starts with leads and ends with sales, the flywheel starts by attracting and educating leads with strategic content and takes them through from the Attract stage into Engage, Close, and Delight. The reason it is a wheel shape rather than a traditional funnel is because delighted customers will naturally draw in more leads through word of mouth and reviews, which will start the wheel process all over with your next cohort of prospects. These 4 stages are all essential pieces of the <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/inbound" rel="noopener" target="_blank">inbound flywheel</a><u>,</u> with Attract and Engage primarily under the purview of marketing, Close primarily a sales phase, and Delight as a focus for your service team.</p>
<p>We approach SaaS marketing with a keen eye toward the holistic inbound flywheel, because all of the parts connect to attract, qualify, sell, and keep your subscribers.</p>
<h3>Start with a Smart Strategy &amp; Draw in Leads with Inbound Marketing</h3>
<p>Your product is at the center of this entire conversation. It’s useful, fun, profitable, or unforgettable. Essentially, your product has propelled you this far, and it is good enough to have attracted some users and created some traction for you. But in order to supercharge your sales efforts, you need a steady stream of good-fit leads. And, that’s where inbound marketing comes into play. You need a well-crafted marketing strategy that makes the most of every dollar you spend to reach the right prospects, build trust in your company and specific products, and clearly set you apart from competitors. Then you need an implementation plan that uses the right tools to send the right messages at the right time to attract attention and keep potential customers focused on you as they make their buying decisions.</p>
<p>To help you pull it all together, we’ve created this comprehensive SaaS Marketing Guide. It covers everything you need to know to build a strong, successful digital marketing strategy that pulls in traffic and vets leads for you, so your sales team can focus on growth goals.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Fundamentals of SaaS Marketing</h2>
<p>Every SaaS Marketing program will be different, because each company and set of products has its unique attributes and goals. However, there are fundamentals the every SaaS marketing department (and by extension sales and service) should know about. Whether you're brushing up on the latest techniques for yourself or your department, or learning more about how it all works so you can vet your next agency hire, this section provides all the basics. Let's start with the wide-lens view with the SaaS Marketing Flywheel, then move into your marketing foundation in the form of your brand, tech stack and website.</p>
<h3>SaaS Marketing Flywheel</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=1600&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png" alt="google-1593027971031" width="1600" srcset="https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=800&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png 800w, https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=1600&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png 1600w, https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=2400&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png 2400w, https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=3200&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png 3200w, https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=4000&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png 4000w, https://www.clearpivot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Rich%20Text%20Pasting/google-1593027971031.png?width=4800&amp;name=google-1593027971031.png 4800w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></p>
<h4>Attract</h4>
<p>The first part of the SaaS marketing flywheel is Attract. In this piece, your goals will relate to getting brand new leads into your database. While each company will need its own specific strategy and KPIs, a few of the <a href="https://www.clearpivot.com/blog/saas-marketing-metrics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most important SaaS marketing metrics</a> to track are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website Visits</li>
<li>Bounce Rate</li>
<li>Visitor to Lead Conversion Rate</li>
</ul>
<h4>Engage</h4>
<p>Once you’ve attracted a potential customer and converted them on something small, like a content offer, your next step is to further engage that lead as a way to qualify, sort and segment them in your database, and prime them for a sale if they’re a great fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversion Rates and Details on Your Content Offers</li>
<li>Landing Page Interactions</li>
<li>Email Engagement (like open rate and click-through rate)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Close</h4>
<p>Your sales team typically oversees the Close phase of your holistic inbound program, and, along with marketing leadership, pays close attention to metrics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</li>
<li>Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this particular resource is focused on SaaS Marketing, so we don’t go in-depth on SaaS sales here, but everything marketing does is meant to support sales and company growth, so it’s important to remember just how intertwined the process of inbound can be.</p>
<h4>Delight</h4>
<p>The last stage in the inbound flywheel is to make your customers feel so included and happy they can’t help but share everything they love about your company and solution. Typically overseen by your Service team, this part of the flywheel helps you strive for improvements in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription Upgrades</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Survey Results</li>
<li>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Further down in this guide we go into a ton of detail of every level of this flywheel concept, specifically related to SaaS marketing. But before we get there, let's continue our exploration of the basic foundations for great SaaS marketing. Up next is more about your brand, tech stack and website.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Your Brand: What Impression Are You Making?</h3>
<p>We don’t have to tell you how important branding is, but when’s the last time you evaluated the impact of your brand on your business goals? Does your original brand still resonate with your target audience? Is it time to refresh your look, the tone of your writing, or bring in something new to stay relevant? Especially in the world of cloud-based technology and software solutions, your brand is crucial. It’s what differentiates your company from everyone else, and allows for a foothold for your audience to get on board. Let’s get real about your SaaS branding efforts.</p>
<h4>Brand Messaging for SaaS</h4>
<p>In the context of software, where there is not necessarily a physical product or place, your brand is even more crucial than in other businesses. Building a SaaS brand is a unique experience, where personality, design, and messaging come together to guide your customers into believing in your solution. Before your leads ever get into the sales process, your brand helps them to build confidence in your company’s knowledge, honesty, and helpfulness.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re not creating your SaaS brand in a vacuum. You’re creating it for <em>people. </em>Smart marketers create buyer personas: generalized representations that humanize each key segment of your target audience. Though they exist only on paper, personas embody typical traits of each prospective customer group: age, gender, income, job function, chief pain points and desires. They serve as “advisors” as you create your marketing tactics and messaging so you can speak to prospects as if you are having an in-person conversation.</p>
<h4>How to Use Storytelling to Connect with Real People</h4>
<p>Building brand affinity starts with storytelling. Tell stories about how, exactly, your customers are using your SaaS product. Focus on the feeling it gives them, the accomplishments it helps them to achieve, or the bottom-line impact. Try sharing more about how your solution was created, and why. It’s not just about the brand promise of what your solution can do. It’s also about telling the human stories behind it to build trust and convey your core values.</p>
<p>Share the story of your founders, how they met, and what sparked the idea for your innovative solution. Tell your customer stories, sharing their unique applications of your products, …</p></div></span></p></div></div></div>

Over the course of thirty years, its economy grew almost tenfold. And while extremists always enjoyed a loud say in Poland’s raucous public sphere, the government changed hands through free and fair elections on multiple occasions. By the early 2010s, political scientists were convinced that the country’s democratic system had become “consolidated.”</p><p>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Poland’s status as a consolidated democracy was a naïve illusion. The country’s divisions were more dangerous, and the population’s attachment to the values of liberal democracy more tenuous, than scholars realized. And so Poland has, since the election of a populist government under the leadership of Jarosław Kaczyński five short years ago, gone from the most prominent case study of the benefits of liberal democracy to the most important exemplar of its perennial brittleness.</p><p>Sadly, the outcome of yesterday’s elections raises the threat to Polish democracy to an even higher level. After a nasty and bigoted campaign, Andrzej Duda managed to win reelection as the country’s president by the narrowest of margins. This leaves the <em>Law and Justice</em> party, which already enjoyed a parliamentary majority, free to continue its attacks on the media and the independence of the judiciary. With legislative elections that might put a real check on the government’s power over three years away, Kaczyński and his allies are likely to succeed in destroying Polish democracy.</p><p><strong>The Playbook of the Elected Autocrat</strong></p><p>The Polish government stands for many things I abhor. In the last weeks of the campaign, Duda warned that homosexuals were seeking to corrupt Poland’s children, and claimed that his opponent would do the bidding of Jews out to take revenge on the Polish nation.</p><p>But what the shameful propagandists of Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Jarosław Kaczyński’s Poland—who sadly include many supposedly serious American conservatives, from Patrick Deneen to Michael Brendan Dougherty—miss is that this is not what makes the government antidemocratic.</p><p>In a liberal democracy, we have to tolerate profound disagreements over values, even when we are firmly convinced that our adversaries are bigots. But what we cannot tolerate is attacks on the institutions that are supposed to ensure a fair chance of displacing the government when the next elections roll around.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/905962/viktor-orbns-american-apologists">the willful blindness</a> of people like Deneen and Dougherty, this is precisely the principle that Poland’s government has systematically broken. As the Rutgers political scientist R. Daniel Kelemen has pointed out, elected autocrats tend to follow six steps: win elections; capture referees, such as courts and other independent bodies; attack or seize control of the media; demonize and undermine the opposition; change the rules of the game; and win new elections that are no longer free.</p><p>Even before yesterday’s vote, the Polish government was well on its way towards accomplishing these goals. When Law and Justice swept to power, the party promised cultural restraint and economic largesse. But while it did pass a popular child benefit scheme, it also set about polarizing society and punishing adversaries.</p><p>The first order of business was a large-scale attack on the independence of the judiciary. As soon as it was in control, Law and Justice curbed the power of the Constitutional Tribunal; changed the composition of the Supreme Court, filling it with partisan loyalists; abolished the independence of the body that nominates lower-court judges; founded a parallel court system to oversee elections; and forbade judges from criticizing government policy. According to the latest country report by Freedom House, the country’s judiciary is no longer independent. </p><p>The second order of business was an equally effective attack on the country’s public broadcaster, Telewizja Polska (TVP). Like the BBC in the United Kingdom, the network is meant to strive for political neutrality. Instead, the Law and Justice government transformed an admittedly flawed institution into a shameless outlet for racist and homophobic propaganda that makes Fox News look like the <em>New York Review of Books</em>. </p><p>Its control over public television has allowed Law and Justice to demonize the opposition with abandon. Over the last weeks of the campaign, TVP variously accused Duda’s challenger, Rafał Trzaskowski, of planning to sell Poland out to Jews, Germans, or the LGBTQ lobby. As the supposedly neutral presenter of a primetime news show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/polish-populism-evening-news-public-broadcaster-presidential-election">intoned a few weeks before the first round of the elections</a>: “Experts have no doubt [that] the stream of money that currently flows from the state budget into the pockets of Polish families will dry up if Trzaskowski, after his possible victory in the presidential election, will seek to satisfy Jewish demands.”</p><p>Now that the government’s power is secured for another three years, the fear that the government will further undermine free speech and independent institutions is not a hostile assumption: it is a promise the government itself repeatedly made over the course of the campaign. The most immediate step will likely be to capture those remaining newspapers and television channels that are free to criticize the government. Since many of them are owed by companies based outside the country, the government has vowed to “re-Polonize the media.”</p><p>In the final step towards authoritarianism, <a href="https://twitter.com/rdanielkelemen/status/1282673577964249089">Kelemen warns</a>, the government is likely to start attacking the integrity of the electoral system itself. The opportunities to do so are many: Law and Justice could try to get the electoral commission under tight control, make it harder for Poles who live abroad to participate in democratic elections, and take away powers from big city mayors, who tend to belong to the opposition party.</p><p>In <em>The People vs Democracy</em>, I warned that opponents of populism usually have only one chance to vote aspiring autocrats out of office. In their first four or five years in power, populist governments tend to skew the playing field in a dangerous way, but don’t usually succeed in completely capturing independent institutions such as electoral commissions. If they have another four or five years at their disposal, the takeover of the political system becomes complete.</p><p>I fear that this is the fate that will now befall Poland. Yesterday’s elections, though no longer fair, were largely free. There is no guarantee that this will still be true when Law and Justice next has to face the electorate.</p><p><strong>Poland’s Lesson for Other Countries Ruled By Populists</strong></p><p>Scholars are always tempted to believe that events that contemporaries failed to predict had nevertheless been predestined to happen all along. Nobody saw the French Revolution coming, for example, and yet successive generations of historians have triumphantly identified its deep and incontrovertible causes. (Needless to say, each successive generation of historians has identified <em>different</em> deep and incontrovertible causes.)</p><p>But the truth is that history is full of critical junctures in which countries and societies are set on divergent paths because of small, contingent factors. The election in Poland was one of these junctures. With the country deeply divided between west and east, young and old, urban and rural, Duda’s margin of victory was extremely close. A slightly different set of campaign tactics, a heavy storm over the country’s eastern part, or simply a more independent media could very well have made a decisive difference to the outcome.</p><p>These events did not materialize, however, and so Poland has now set out on the path towards dictatorship. Over the next three years, demographic changes are likely to favor the opposition. But by the time the precarious balance of public opinion shifts against the government, the vote is no longer likely to be either free or fair.</p><p>Circumstance has conspired against Polish democracy. Whether the structural factors that favor the opponents of authoritarian populism can overcome the tremendous power now enjoyed by the government is, at best, an open question. Anyone who is doubtful about the urgency of voting out authoritarian populists in other countries—from Brazil to the United States—before they can consolidate their hold on power would do very well to take heed.</p></div></div>]]>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>Jul 15, 2020</span></p><p>Picture this: you’ve stumbled across the vulnerability of the year. You figured out how to gain access to any verified Twitter user’s account: Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, XXXTentacion, Apple, you name it. That was step 1 of your evil plan. What should step 2 be?</p>

<p>Maybe you log into the president’s account and post a fake tweet about launching missiles to North Korea. I’m not convinced that you can start a world war just by sending out a few fake tweets, but for the sake of argument let’s say that you can. But you’re not interested in watching the world burn anyway; no, your goal is to <strong>make as much money as possible</strong>. What should you do?</p>

<p>The people who carried out today’s Twitter hack had one answer: post variants of the message “send 1 BTC to this address and I’ll send 2 BTC back”  on famous accounts, and then (here’s the kicker) <em>don’t actually send 2 BTC back</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/test-uploads/_uncategorized/1594848885006-image.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>They managed to run off with a little over <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh?page=2">$100,000</a> before Twitter got the situation under control. Several people (on Twitter, on Hacker News, everywhere really) scoffed at this and claimed that they would have done something much more interesting with this kind of power. Let’s explore some of their ideas to see if we really can do better.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="stock-market-manipulation">Stock Market Manipulation</h2>

<p>This is the first thing that comes to most people’s minds. It sounds easy: buy a bunch of Tesla stock, log into Elon Musk’s account, tweet “Taking $TSLA private at $2000,” and sell in the time between the rise in price and when Musk/Twitter/the whole world realizes the hack.</p>

<p>This requires a fair amount of capital to buy the underlying stock, which the hacker may not have had, but there are other options: maybe you short the stock and then tweet (fake) damaging information about Tesla’s new line of cars. Maybe you just short Twitter’s own stock, which will surely take a huge hit in the market tomorrow (the hack was executed after trading hours).</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">oh lol i'd buy HTZ, that's the trade. "i've decided that Tesla will buy Hertz out of bankruptcy at $69 per share and make its fleet entirely self-driving," i'd be a billionaire and Money Stuff would end on the highest possible note</p>— Matt Levine (@matt_levine) <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1283503080978489344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>The big issue with all of these is that it’s very difficult to participate in the stock market anonymously. The SEC has all sorts of monitoring in place to catch more common forms of insider trading and fraud and you can guarantee that they would conduct a long, thorough investigation into a hypothetical hack-based market fraud. Unlike Bitcoin transactions, wire transfers and stock purchases can be reversed after the fact, and the exposure and risk go way up when you’re actually working with US dollars.</p>

<h2 id="blackmail">Blackmail</h2>

<p>The hackers got <em>full access</em> to all Twitter-verified accounts, meaning that they should have had access to their direct messages. Surely this is much more valuable than just posting a fake tweet? Think about the incalculable damage caused by the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack">Sony leaks</a> or watch this hypothetical-but-still-terrifying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q">Tom Scott video</a> about a world in which Gmail password-checking was turned off for a day.</p>

<p>It’s definitely true that there are gobs of interesting material lurking in verified users’s DMs that they wouldn’t want seeing the light of day, but it’s a little tricky to make money from this. The most obvious method is blackmail. Exfiltrate the messages from the most popular users and threaten that you’ll release them in full if they don’t send X BTC to Y address.</p>

<p>This would definitely make some amount of money, but I’m not convinced it’s worth the effort. Firstly, it’s hard to judge ahead of time which accounts have the juicy DMs. Large, high-profile accounts like Joe Biden’s are run by a whole social media team and probably don’t exchange sensitive information via Twitter. Smaller accounts probably do have more interesting gossip, but might be less willing or able to pay as a result.</p>

<p>Then there’s the problem of actually exfiltrating and storing all the data, sending individual messages to each of the users you hack, tracking who has and hasn’t paid, and actually releasing the leaked material publicly. It’s a lot of operational overhead that may, in the end, net you less money than the dumb Bitcoin scam.</p>

<h2 id="sell-it-on-the-dark-web">Sell it on the dark web</h2>

<p>Leave aside the challenge of actually finding a buyer (you can’t just make a post on a forum, the Feds read the dark web too). How much should a buyer be willing to pay you for this bug? Either the buyer is planning to monetize the exploit for more than $100k (the whole point of this post is to prove that that’s really hard!), or the buyer wants to use the exploit for other purposes, like surveillance or intelligence gathering.</p>

<p>This isn’t out of the question. Countries spy on each other all the time, and I’m sure that China would love to be able to read the DMs of journalists or Hong Kong activists. The issue is that this particular exploit wasn’t terribly suited to the business of long-term surveillance. Logging into the account required actually the email associated with it and triggering a password reset (that somehow also bypassed 2FA). The password reset triggered a notification email to the original address on file, which basically announced the account takeover. The hacker had a matter of hours before the whole world knew about the vulnerability.</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies want <em>persistent</em> access, and they want to surveil without their targets learning that they were surveilled. This exploit wouldn’t have accomplished that.</p>

<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere… Large companies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/05/31/hacker-finds-huge-apple-security-hole-apple-pays-100000-bug-bounty/#576388b36894">routinely</a> pay out vast sums of money to white hat hackers reporting flaws that are less damaging than this one. Even if Twitter wouldn’t pay out 100% as much money as was made via the Bitcoin scam, bug bounty programs have the added benefit of being 100% legal, which should change the risk calculus significantly. So why didn’t our hacker take this route?</p>

<p>One theory is that if the hacker was already a known criminal, it’s tricky to collect the bug bounty payout without revealing their identity to Twitter, which might still end them up in some trouble. I’m not sure I buy this (can’t they just use a third party?).</p>

<p>More plausibly, perhaps Twitter wouldn’t actually have paid out $100k?</p>

<blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/I902KoaZwe">pic.twitter.com/I902KoaZwe</a></p>— LiveOverflow 🔴 (@LiveOverflow) <a href="https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow/status/1283511782380908545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>This tweet suggests that OAuth takeovers were valued at $7.7k (and after taxes you’re left with chump change). If so, this a big issue with Twitter’s bug bounty program! You need to ensure that the incentives make reporting more worth it than exploiting.</p>

<p><em>Update: more reporting about how the account takeovers were executed <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos">has emerged</a>, and it suggests that there wasn’t any technical vulnerability that was ever exploited. Social engineering and insider risk (which can obviously be quite damaging) tend not to be eligible for bounties on most programs.</em></p>

<h2 id="phishing">Phishing</h2>

<p>OK how about this: log into Coinbase’s twitter account, craft a tweet announcing some snazzy new feature and include a bit.ly link that actually goes to a phishing website. Execute a <a href="https://fortenf.org/e/2018/05/29/coinbase-phishing.html">relay phishing attack</a> that gives you access to their Coinbase account while bypassing 2FA, and then send all their Bitcoin and Ethereum and Dogecoin to your own account.</p>

<p>There are a few flaws, but most are surmountable with some effort. First, Twitter would probably take down the tweet pretty fast, so you’d probably want to target several different accounts of famous cryptocurrency enthusiasts (not just Coinbase). Second, bit.ly would probably disable that specific URL and Google would definitely add the phishing site to their <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> list (which is shared by all major browsers). This would result in big scary red warning banners appearing before users could access your site. Also, whatever registrar you purchased your domain from would probably revoke it.</p>

<p>OK, so instead of having one phishing site and one domain and one URL you’d want to set up several of these in advance and hop from one to the other as each gets taken down by various actors in turn. This would probably work! Would it net you more than $100k? Maybe?! It’s hard to say and probably depends a lot on luck and timing. The people with the most cryptocurrency in their Coinbase accounts are probably the least likely to fall for this kind of thing in the first place, so it’s unclear how much more money you’d make than the dumb 2-for-1 scam, but still, it might be worth it in case you manage to compromise an account with huge reserves.</p>

<p>Still, all this requires some legitimately difficult software engineering work and the whole point of this was to make easy money! I understand that today’s attack was almost painfully lame in its execution, but it really may have been the smartest choice tactically.</p>

<p>This is not to say that they did everything right: I still can’t explain why they seem to have used only 1 BTC address throughout the process (Coinbase and other exchanges quickly blocked transactions to this address), and the wording on some of their tweets was stilted and awkward (surely they could have paid for a Grammarly subscription). But in the end, I think there’s no evidence that the twitter posts were just a “cover” for the real attack or that this hack had anything to do with a foreign government. I think this tweet sums it up well:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">High impact bugs can sometimes be found and exploited by anyone, even dogs who have no idea what to do with the car they caught. There really doesn't have to be more to it than that.</p>— Brad Hill (@hillbrad) <a href="https://twitter.com/hillbrad/status/1283597241685438464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>Metallurgists</strong></p>
<p>I have enjoyed writing many articles about the history of different knife steels over the past couple years of this website. It has been very challenging to track down the history of different steels to see where they came from and how. I decided to write an article about some of the greats who have made contributions to knife steel and knife tests. Many of these metallurgists didn’t know they were developing steels that would be used in knives. Some were developing tool steels or high speed steels. However, their steels have since been used in knives or their steel designs influenced other steels which have been used in knives. To keep this article manageable in size I have focused on those that developed steel or tests of knives. In other words, those that studied different aspects of steel are not included. Some notable people that were omitted for this reason include:</p>
<p>1) Marcus Grossman and Edgar Bain who discovered bainite and wrote a couple influential books on steel metallurgy</p>
<p>2) Many metallurgists who are less directly applicable but discovered many fundamentals of steel and general metallurgy, such as Henry Clifton Sorby (microscopy), Dmitry Chernov (phase transitions in steel), and William Roberts-Austen (iron-carbon phase diagram).</p>
<p>3) Metallurgists who studied heat treatment techniques. Taylor and White in the list below are a possible exception to this, however.</p>
<p>4) Influential teachers of metallurgy, some even directly to knifemakers like Kevin Cashen. Some on this list are also known for their teaching, but make the list primarily for other specific contributions.</p>
<p>So that list of categories may mean that some people you may think of as great metallurgists did not make the list. However, even with those omissions I think you will find some interesting information about the contributions of certain individuals and groups that developed the steel products we use in knives today.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Forester Mushet</strong></p>
<p>Mushet developed the first tool steel in 1868 which had several important characteristics. One was that it was the first commercially produced “alloy steel” meaning it had intentional alloy additions including manganese and tungsten to achieve certain properties, rather than being a simple carbon steel. The high tungsten in the steel gave it very high wear resistance for longer tool life. It was also the first “air hardening” steel meaning it could be allowed to cool in air from high temperature rather than quenching in oil or water. This steel was the basis of experiments from Taylor and White that led to the development of high speed steels and the explosion of development in other tool steels. Mushet is actually better known for making improvements to the “Bessemer process” which allowed the production of steel at much lower costs. But for his contributions to the future of knife steel his “Mushet steel” is huge. You can read more in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/03/22/the-history-of-the-first-tool-steel/">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Mushet</p>
<p><strong>Frederick Winslow Taylor and Maunsel White</strong></p>
<p>These Bethlehem Steel metallurgists started modern steel development in many ways. Prior to their contributions, steel was heat treated in a fairly narrow temperature range, such as 1400-1600°F. Overheating would lead to grain growth and poor toughness. However, they discovered that when Mushet steel was heated to very high temperatures prior to quenching, that it could last much longer as a high speed tool, because it maintained high hardness at high speeds and therefore high temperatures. Their discovery of “high speed steel” was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition (a world’s fair) and led to a T1-type high speed steel by 1903. The knowledge developed and the excitement generated led to the development of many other tool steels.

<p>White</p>
<p><strong>Harry Brearley</strong></p>
<p>While there were several people working on inventing stainless steel in a similar time period, Brearley is credited with being the first to commercialize it. And what type of stainless steel did he commercialize? A knife steel! For several years afterward, stainless steel was known as being for knives and many people didn’t even realize it could be used for other things. The steel he developed was 420 stainless. This steel may have a relatively poor reputation among knife enthusiasts today, but it has been used in as many knives as any steel, perhaps the most used knife steel. And it has very good corrosion resistance. This steel was the basis for all future stainless knife steels, especially those like 420HC and AEB-L with the similar chromium content of 13%. The original name for S90V was 420V because the same chromium content of 420 was used in its development.

<p><strong>James P. Gill</strong></p>
<p>Gill was a metallurgist working for VASCO which is a company largely forgotten by knife collectors now, but made many significant contributions to tool steels. Gill developed the first commercially available high vanadium steels, such as the first 2% vanadium high speed steel in 1937 which evolved to become M2, and also M4 with its 4% vanadium and T15 with 5% vanadium. Many knife steels today continue to have high vanadium contents for improved wear resistance. Gill also wrote one of the first books on Tool Steels in 1934, which continued with new editions up until the 5th in 1998. These books on Tool Steels have been used by metallurgists for decades. Read more about James Gill in <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/04/16/the-development-of-first-tool-steels-book/">this article</a>. Gill also developed the 5% Cr + Mo alloying approach that led to the common <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/04/22/a2-steel-history-and-properties/">knife steel A2</a>&nbsp;and continues to be used by many non-stainless tool steels.</p>

<p><strong>John A. Mathews</strong></p>
<p>Mathews worked for Crucible and Halcomb steel in the early 1900s and was highly influential for his steel developments and contributions to steel research. He patented the original T1 high speed steel with a small vanadium addition which improved the properties of early high speed steels. Vanadium additions were basically unheard of at the time but became very popular for various uses afterward. Mathews also developed the first “oil-hardening” steels including the popular O1 in 1905 which continues to be used in knives today.

<p><strong>Harry Johnstin</strong></p>
<p>Johnstin developed the steels Vasco Wear and Vasco Die in 1964. Vasco Wear is probably better known now as CruWear (Crucible branding of the same steel), though it is known by many names such as PD#1, Lescowear, and Z-Wear. Vasco Wear saw use in knives by the 70s and continues to be a popular choice in its various versions. A relatively unknown fact is that CPM-3V is in fact a powder metallurgy version of Vasco Die. Surprisingly, Crucible metallurgists were able to patent the powder metallurgy of Vasco Die despite the composition being previously patented (and expired), because the change to the microstructure and properties were deemed to be significant enough. Vasco Die and Vasco Wear also created the “8% Cr” tool steel category which became future steels like Vanadis 4 (before Vanadis 4 Extra), Vanadis 10, Sleipner, A8 Mod, DC53, Z-Tuff, CD#1, and others.

<p><strong>David J. Giles</strong></p>
<p>David Giles was a metallurgist who developed many tool steels for Latrobe steel. Giles developed several steels which have seen use in knives, including 440A in 1926 [1]. 440A has been used extensively in consumer knives ever since, and served as the basis for the higher carbon 440C, which was incredibly popular in production and custom knives in the 70s and 80s, and continues to be used today. 154CM was originally called “440C Mod” because they reduced the Cr in 440C and replaced it with Mo. Read more about 154CM history <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/05/21/154cm-development-properties-legacy/">in this article</a>. This 17-19% Cr base&nbsp; composition of 440A/440C served as the starting point for many future steels such as Elmax and S60V. Giles also developed 4-5% vanadium cold work steels A7 and D7 (as opposed to Gill who developed high speed steels) which served as a basis for future steels like CPM-10V. The patent-holder of 10V, Walter Haswell, previously worked at Latrobe steel and was a co-patent holder on several vanadium steels there as well, which used the same carbon-vanadium ratio equations that Giles had previously proposed [2]. D7 became Bohler’s powder metallurgy K190, which was further modified to <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/06/15/what-is-the-best-budget-knife-steel/">develop the popular stainless M390</a>.</p>

They also developed S90V [3], which is popular in knives in its own right but also led to S110V which is essentially a modified S90V, developed by Al Kajinic. The biggest contribution of S90V was the discovery that using 14% Cr (as opposed to 17-18% Cr in earlier steels like S60V and Elmax), led to a better utilization of vanadium additions for improved properties. This led to a “14% Cr plus vanadium” basis for several future Crucible steels like S30V. The S90V patent also lays out how they explored different levels of nitrogen in S90V, which wasn’t really utilized in the final composition, but increased nitrogen (~0.15-0.20%) was used in S30V, S110V, and S45VN. Pinnow and Stasko also patented CPM-15V which continues to be one of the highest wear resistance steels available [4]. Stasko was also co-listed with Andrzej Wojcieszynski for patenting CPM Rex 86 and CPM Rex 121 steels [5].</p>

<p><strong>Dick Barber</strong></p>
<p>Barber is best known for developing CPM-S30V steel, which has been one of the most popular steels used in high end production knives for nearly two decades. S30V was the first steel produced by Crucible to have an intentionally increased nitrogen content of about 0.20%. S30V also served as the starting point for the popular <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/13/s35vn-steel-properties-and-how-to-heat-treat/">S35VN</a>, and the more recent <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2020/01/15/spyderco-exclusive-cpm-spy27-steel-analysis/">SPY27</a> and <a href="https://knifesteelnerds.com/2019/11/01/crucible-s45vn-steel/">S4…</a></p></div></div>

<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/16102948y9dIHsQN-2.png"></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Zulip Server 3.0 contains major visual design improvements, dramatic scalability and performance improvements, a new logo, and several of Zulip's most requested features to help users efficiently read, skim, search, and refer back to their messages. Zulip is 100% free and open-source software, and ships with translations for 16 languages.</p><p>Zulip 3.0 is our largest release ever, with over 4100 new commits since December's Zulip 2.1 release. A total of 110 people contributed commits to Zulip 3.0, bringing <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/">the Zulip server project</a> to 619 distinct code contributors. With <a href="https://zulip.com/team">54 people</a> who’ve contributed 100+ commits, Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software.</p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and docs, reporting issues, testing changes, translating, posting feedback on <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html">chat.zulip.org</a>, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.</p><h2 id="project-highlights"><strong>Project highlights</strong></h2><p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server, but lots of exciting work has happened outside the server codebase over the last several months as well. Highlights include:</p><ul><li>Zulip has experienced an extraordinary increase in usage in 2020 as a result of the ongoing pandemic changing how people work. &nbsp;It's been incredibly gratifying to <a href="https://monadical.com/posts/how-to-make-remote-work-part-two-zulip.html">hear from users</a> about how Zulip has helped them make remote work, conferences, teaching, and meetups successful. &nbsp;We now sponsor free Zulip Cloud Standard hosting for hundreds of worthy <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source projects</a>, non-profits, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/research/">research groups</a>, and similar non-commercial organizations. &nbsp;New organizations can apply during the <a href="https://zulip.com/new">signup flow</a> or on the billing page.</li><li>Zulip Cloud has introduced <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2020/05/27/zulip-responds-to-pandemic-with-60-day-free-trial/">60-day free trials</a> for commercial users to help ensure that budget freezes aren't a barrier to experimenting with Zulip. &nbsp;Zulip has robust data import tools for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">Slack</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-mattermost">Mattermost</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-gitter">Gitter</a>.</li><li>Zulip has a new logo! Constructed from two chat bubbles that together form a Z (with a second Z in the negative space between them!), it replaces our aging “green Z inside a circle” logo created in 2013.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1000w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/zulip-logo-gradient.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Our primary domain is now <a href="https://zulip.com/">https://zulip.com</a>.

Many of the features advertised here and in our full changelog were built by current GSoC students or alumni of the program.</li></ul><h2 id="release-highlights"><strong>Release highlights</strong></h2><p>Because this is such a huge release, just listing the hundreds of important changes in this release makes our <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/changelog.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">changelog</a> incredibly long. Here are just some highlights:</p><p><strong>Core user experience</strong></p><ul><li>Added <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/rename-a-topic" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">support for moving topics (or messages within topics) between streams</a>. This was by far our most requested feature.</li><li>Redesigned the top navbar/search area to be much cleaner and show stream descriptions. This was our second most requested feature, and removes what had been Zulip’s most visible UI wart.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_1E7A3465D8563B08C899BE809773AB4DB2AEE627A10B56FB07707A14E1AA0EC0_1594859150872_image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Stream descriptions can contain Zulip markdown such as links, emoji, and even LaTeX!</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Added “Recent Topics”, a useful new interface for browsing conversations. Feedback so far has been extremely positive, and we plan to make a version of this the default view in Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 600w, https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-16--6--Goals---Zulip-Dev---Zulip-1.png 891w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li>Essentially every widget in the Zulip UI received significant polish work in this release.</li></ul><p><strong>Message formatting</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip has an innovative new feature for scheduling meetings with global participants. Instead of doing gymnastics to clearly communicate a meeting time to an audience across the globe, you can <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#mention-a-time" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">use a date picker to write a time</a> which Zulip will show in each reader’s own timezone.</li><li>Zulip’s markup now supports <a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#spoilers" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">spoiler blocks</a>.</li><li><a href="https://zulipchat.com/help/quote-and-reply" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Quote-and-reply</a> now generates a handy link to the referenced message.</li></ul><p><strong>Server</strong></p><ul><li>This release adds support for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal, and ends support for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial and Debian 9 Stretch (both of which were based on Python 3.5, which reaches EOL in September). See our documentation for <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrading the operating system</a>.</li><li>Zulip now defaults to using PostgreSQL 12 on new installs, with support for PostgreSQL 10–12. (Previously, Zulip always used whatever PostgreSQL version came with the base OS release.) This release also adds a convenient new tool to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">upgrade </a><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">PostgreSQL</a>.</li><li>Numerous major performance improvements. Zulip’s server-to-client push system scales 4x better than in Zulip 2.x, and several of the most common queries are much faster. Performance has improved dramatically for organizations like our own Zulip development community with 10,000s of user accounts.</li><li>We upgraded Django from 1.11.x to the latest LTS series, 2.2.x. We continue to love how every major Django release comes with great features that we hadn't realized we needed!</li><li>We're moving to a new versioning scheme with only 2 digits; the next maintenance release will be Zulip Server 3.1 and the next major release will be Zulip Server 4.0.</li></ul><p><strong>API and API Documentation</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip’s <a href="https://zulip.com/api" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">REST API documentation</a> received a major overhaul both of content and presentation. Most importantly, our automated tests now validate every API request, response, and example against the OpenAPI schemas used to generate the API documentation. Because the Zulip server has nearly 100% test coverage, this ensures the API documentation is always consistent with the implementation.</li><li>Zulip now has <a href="https://zulip.com/api/changelog" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a detailed API changelog</a> which documents exactly when each API change was introduced. The <code>zulip_feature_level</code> field in <a href="https://zulipchat.com/api/get-server-settings" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">the server settings API</a> (which is more fine-grained than a server release), when combined with the changelog, allows client applications to know exactly what any given Zulip server supports. This should make it easier for developers (including developers of the official desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) to write full-featured client apps directly off of the API documentation, without needing to investigate server internals.</li><li>Documenting the API provided a natural audit of Zulip’s API for obscure quirks and mistakes that would be better cleaned up than documented. As a result, this release contains dozens of changes to the Zulip API, which had previously been quite stable for years. Because of careful backwards-compatibility work, these shouldn’t cause any disruption (Zulip mobile app releases from 6 months ago work unmodified against this release!)</li></ul><p><strong>Integrations</strong></p><ul><li>New external authentication method integrations: <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#plug-and-play-sso-google-github-gitlab" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html#sign-in-with-apple" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Sign in with Apple</a>.</li><li>The Zulip desktop apps now do social authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.) via an external browser, which improves security and provides a more pleasant single sign-on experience.</li><li>Added <a href="https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a new incoming webhook API</a> that accepts messages in the format used by Slack’s incoming webhooks API. This means that some third-party products that integrate with Slack but don’t have a generic outgoing-webhook feature can now easily integrate with Zulip.</li><li><a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/authentication-methods.html#saml" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Zulip’s popular SAML integration</a> now supports login initiated from the SAML Identity Provider.</li><li>BigBlueButton joins Jitsi and Zoom as a supported video call provider. We also rewrote the Zoom integration to have a much better OAuth user experience. The Google Hangouts video call integration was removed due to Google Hangouts reaching end of life. (Its replacement, Google Meet, does not offer a similar API for third-party apps to create calls.)</li><li><a href="https://www.zulipchat.com/integrations/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">New native integrations</a> for ErrBit, Grafana, Thinkst Canary, and Prometheus Alertmanager, with improvements to the integrations for GitHub, GitLab, Sentry, Taiga, Semaphore, and many more.</li></ul><p><strong>Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Zulip now uses the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> CSS property to determine whether to default to the day theme or the popular night theme, based on the operating system’s theme.</li><li>Zulip’s notification settings UI has been redesigned around an intuitive table format, displaying all individual streams that have non-default settings.

    Posted on July 13, 2020
    
        by Troels Henriksen
    
</p>

<p>Futhark is supposed to be a safe programming language. This implies that risky operations, such as <code>a[i]</code> which indexes an array at some arbitrary index, should be protected with a dynamic check. While C programmers are famous for never making mistakes, and therefore C does not perform do such checking, the vast majority of programming languages do check array indexes, usually by generating code like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt; n) {
  // throw exception

  // OR print error message

  // OR terminate program

  // OR do anything else
}</code></pre>
<p>This immediately changes the control flow of the program based on the bounds check. Usually the implementation challenge is not how to perform such checks in the first place, but how to eliminate them in cases where the compiler can statically determine that the check can never fail. However, for Futhark we would like to generate code for GPUs, and GPUs are great at turning solved problems unsolved.</p>
<p>In this post I will describe why it took Futhark <em>years</em> to get support for bounds-checking on the GPU, how we recently solved the problem, and what the performance is like. This post is a rewritten extract of a <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/publications/hlpp20.pdf">recently presented paper</a>, which you can read if you are particularly interested in the details of bounds checking.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-execution"><a href="#asynchronous-execution" id="asynchronous-execution-link" title="asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous execution</a></h2>
<p>The basic problem is that the GPU functions as a <em>co-processor</em> that receives data and code from the CPU, but which is then processed at the GPUs own pace. Explicit synchronisation and copying (both slow) is necessary to exchange information between the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>GPU code is organised as <em>kernels</em> (no relation to operating systems, more like functions), and when we launch code on the GPU, we tell it to run a specific kernel with a specific number of threads, with some specific arguments. It’s a lot like performing an asynchronous remote procedure call. And similarly to a remote procedure, a kernel that contains an index that is out of bounds has no way of directly affecting the control flow of the CPU. In practice, our only option is to simply write a value to a distinguished memory location indicating that things have gone wrong, and then terminate the running GPU thread:</p>
<pre><code>if (i &lt; 0 || i &gt;= n) {
  *global_failure = 1;
  return;  // Terminate GPU thread
}</code></pre>
<p>On the CPU, whenever we launch a GPU kernel, we then <em>block</em> until the kernel is done running, copy back the <code>global_failure</code> value, and check whether a bounds error occurred:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-gpu-cpu-sync.png" alt="A diagram of checking for errors after every GPU kernel."></p>
<p>Surely reading a single number after every kernel (which usually processes tens of thousands of array elements) must be fast? Let’s check the overhead on the Futhark benchmark suite, measured on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead-sync.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>The vertical axis shows the <em>slowdown</em> of synchronous bounds checking compared to not doing any bounds checking. The overhead is pretty bad: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean">geomean</a> of <em>1.66x</em> , and more than <em>6x</em> on the worst affected benchmarks. I’m only measuring those benchmarks that require bounds checking <em>at all</em>, so the mean overhead across all benchmarks would be lower. Still, this is too slow to be practical.</p>
<p>GPUs perform well when given a large queue of work to process at their own pace, not when they constantly stop to transfer 32 bits back to the CPU for inspection, and have to wait for a go-ahead before proceeding. To speed this up, we need to cut the amount of synchronisation.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and consider why we do bounds checking in the first place: we want to avoid corrupting memory by writing to invalid addresses, and we want to avoid making bad control flow decisions based on reading garbage. This implies that we have to do bounds checking <em>immediately</em> whenever we access an array. But since the GPU’s control flow is completely decoupled from what is happening on the CPU, the CPU doesn’t actually need to know immediately that something has gone wrong - it only needs to be informed when it eventually copies data from the GPU, so that it knows not to trust it. The actual <em>check</em> still needs to be done immediately on the GPU, but copying back <code>global_failure</code> to the CPU can wait until the CPU would in any case need to synchronise with the GPU:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-gpu-cpu-async.png" alt="A diagram of delaying error checking."></p>
<p>This amortises the copying overhead over potentially many kernel launches. But we’re still not quite done, as kernel <em>i+1</em> may contain unchecked operations that are safe if and only if the preceding kernel <em>i</em> completed successfully. To address this, we add a prelude to every GPU kernel body where each thread checks whether <code>global_failure</code> is set:</p>
<pre><code>// Prelude added to every GPU kernel
if (*global_failure) {
  return;
}</code></pre>
<p>If so, that must mean one of the preceding kernels has encountered a failure, and so the all threads of the current kernel terminate immediately. Checking <code>global_failure</code> on the GPU is much faster than checking it on the CPU, because it does not involve any synchronisation or copying. The overhead is a single easily cached global memory read for every thread, which is in most cases negligible. Asynchronous checking performs like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead-async.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>Much better! The mean overhead is down to <em>1.07x</em> (compared to <em>1.66x</em> before), and the maximum overhead is <em>1.4x</em> (<em>6x</em> before). The slowest program is now the <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/rodinia/srad/srad.fut">srad</a> benchmark, which is structured roughly as follows:</p>

<p>The <code>reduce</code> runs on the GPU but produces a scalar, which in Futhark’s compilation model is copied back to the CPU where a tiny amount of sequential computation takes place, after which it is used to update the <code>image</code> array in various ways. The fact that we copy a value (even just a single number!) back to the CPU forces us to do a full synchronisation and also check <code>global_failure</code>. This is because the compiler is conservative - it does not understand that <code>x</code> is not going to be used for any CPU-side control flow, but is instead going to be sent right back to the GPU. Since each instance of <code>reduce</code> and <code>map</code> run for extremely short periods (little more than a dozen microseconds each), the communication cost becomes significant. This was already a problem, but bounds checking makes it worse.</p>
<p>The solution to this is not directly related to bounds checking at all, but is about refining our compilation model such that individual scalars are more aggressively kept on the GPU, if we can determine that their value is not truly needed on the CPU. As a side effect, this will allow us to delay checking <code>global_failure</code> until the entire outermost sequential loop has run, which will make the overhead of bounds checking essentially zero. But this is future work.</p>
<h2 id="cross-thread-communication"><a href="#cross-thread-communication" id="cross-thread-communication-link" title="cross-thread-communication">Cross-thread communication</a></h2>
<p>So far, we have assumed that a GPU thread, upon encountering an error, can safely terminate itself, or even the entire kernel. Unfortunately, reality is not so forgiving. A GPU thread can terminate itself, sure, but this can induce deadlocks if the kernel contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science)">barriers</a>, because other threads may be waiting for the now-terminated thread. Life would be easier if the prevailing GPU APIs (CUDA and OpenCL) provided a way for a single thread to unilaterally abort execution of the entire kernel, but they don’t. The solution to this is a little hairy, and involves the failing thread jumping ahead to the next barrier instead of simply terminating, then after each barrier checking whether any threads have failed. See <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/publications/hlpp20.pdf">the paper</a> for the full details. It’s a solution that relies heavily on all communication being under the control of the compiler, so it’s not something you could do for a low-level GPU language.</p>
<h2 id="optimisations"><a href="#optimisations" id="optimisations-link" title="optimisations">Optimisations</a></h2>
<p>All effective and elegant implementation techniques must inevitably be followed by a collection of ad-hoc micro-optimisations of dubious impact, and bounds checking in Futhark is no different. Some of the special cases we handle are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Certain particularly simple kernels are able to execute safely even when previous kernels have failed, typically because they merely copy or replicate memory. Matrix transposition is an example of such a kernel. For these kernels we can eliminate all failure checking entirely, because bounds failures cannot result in memory becoming <em>inaccessible</em>, it can only result in the values stored being <em>wrong</em>, and these simple kernels are not sensitive to the values they are copying.</li>
<li>Some kernels may contain no bounds checks. They still need to check whether any previous kernels have failed, but do not need to be careful with respect to barriers and such.</li>
<li>At run-time, whenever we enqueue a kernel, we have dynamic knowledge of whether any kernels with bounds checks have been enqueued since the last time <code>global_failure</code> was checked. That is, we know dynamically whether <code>global_failure</code> is <em>certainly unset</em>. If so, we can pass that information along to the kernel as a kernel argument, which means the kernel does not have to check the value of <code>global_failure</code> in its prelude.</li>
</ol>
<p>The impact of these optimisations (and others covered in the paper) is quite minor, as shown in the following graph.</p>
<p><img src="https://futhark-lang.org/images/2020-07-13-overhead.png" alt="Slowdown of synchronous bounds checking compared to no bounds checking."></p>
<p>Most of the optimisations were motivated by micro-benchmarks, where the impact is more significant. On these benchmarks, they reduce the mean overhead to <em>1.04x</em> (from <em>1.07x</em>), and have no impact on the maximum overhead. Useful, but not crucial the way asynchronous checking is.</p>
<h2 id="error-messages"><a href="#error-messages" id="error-messages-link" title="error-messages">Error messages</a></h2>
<p>As discussed above, <code>global_failure</code> contains only a single bit of information: did the program fail or not? But the modern programmer is accustomed to luxuries such as being told <em>where</em> it failed, so clearly this will not do. The solution is simple. At compile time, we associate each bounds check with a unique number, a <em>failure code</em>, with a <code>global_failure</code> value of <em>-1</em> meaning <em>no error so far</em>. When a bounds check fails, the thread writes the failure code corresponding to the bounds check. At compile-time we also construct a table that maps each failure code to a <code>printf()</code>-style format string such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>"index %d out of bounds for array of size %d"</code></pre>
<p>For simplicity, <code>%d</code> is the only format specifier that can occur, but each distinct format string can contain a different number of format specifiers. We …</p></div></div>

    <p>Remote sensing instruments like <a href="https://gedi.umd.edu/">NASA’s GEDI</a>, which is mounted to the <a href="https://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/">Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF)</a> on the International Space Station (ISS), produce a massive amount of data and one of the tools scientists use when working with those data is a <em>geo-locator</em>–a geographic coordinates search engine.</p>



<p>GEDI, launched in 2018, is the most powerful lidar instrument in orbit today. The files for version 1 data, which had an initial public release in early 2020, are organized by orbit instead of by <em>tile</em> or grid system. This presents a unique challenge to searching the data efficiently.</p>



<p>This paper looks at how a software developer or scientist might go about creating a GEDI geo-locator–similar in functionality to existing NASA offerings. We dive into how the coordinate data is structured, ways to mathematically generalize the orbit data, and we then build a solution using Python. In a series of explanations we move through an arc of exploration as we think about solving the challenges encountered. The resulting prototype geo-locator leverages a number of Python libraries popular in GIS today and achieves a considerable level of accuracy and performance.</p>

<h2>Don’t bury the lede</h2>



<p>We’re working on a thing to make Firefox start faster! It appears to work! Here’s a video showing off a before (left) and after (right):</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="625" height="352" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/027tOvYZw88?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<h2>Improving Firefox Startup Time With The about:home Startup Cache</h2>



<p>For the past year or so, the Firefox Desktop Front-End Performance team has been concentrating on making improvements to browser startup performance.</p>



<p>The launching of an application like Firefox is quite complex. Meticulous profiling of Firefox startup in various conditions has, thankfully, helped reveal a number of opportunities where we can make improvements. We’ve been evaluating and addressing these opportunities, and several have made it into the past few Firefox releases.</p>



<p>This blog post is about one of those improvements that is currently in the later stages of development. I’m going to describe the improvement, and how we went about integrating it.</p>



<p>In a default installation of Firefox, the first (and only) tab that loads is about:home<sup id="rf1-3036"><a href="#fn1-3036" title="This is only true if the user hasn’t just restarted after applying an update, and if they haven’t set a custom home page or configured Firefox to restore their previous session on start." rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The about:home page is actually the same thing that appears when you open a new tab (about:newtab). The fact that they have different addresses allows us to treat their loading differently.</p>



<p>Your about:home might look slightly different from the above — depending on your locale, it may or may not include the Pocket stories.</p>



<p>Do not be fooled by what appears to be a very simple page of images and text. This page is actually quite sophisticated under the hood. It is designed to be customized by the user in the following ways:</p>



<p>Users can</p>



<ul><li>Collapse or expand sections</li><li>Remove sections entirely</li><li>Reorganize the order of their Top Sites by dragging and dropping</li><li>Pin and unpin Top Sites to their positions</li><li>Add their own custom Top Sites with custom thumbnails</li><li>Add or remove search engines from their Top Sites</li><li>Change the number of rows in the Top Sites and Recommended by Pocket sections</li><li>Choose to have the Highlights composed of any of the following:<ul><li>Visited pages</li><li>Recent bookmarks</li><li>Recent downloads</li><li>Pages recently saved to Pocket</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>The user can customize these things at any time, and any open copies of the page are expected to reflect those customizations immediately.</p>



<p>There are further complexities beyond user customization. The page is also designed to be easy for our design and engineering teams to experiment with reorganizing the layout and composition of the page so that they can test variations on its layout in the wild.</p>



<p>The about:home page also has special privileges not afforded to normal websites. It can</p>



<ul><li>Save and remove bookmarks</li><li>Add pages to Pocket</li><li>Cause the URL bar to be focused and selected</li><li>Show thumbnails for pages that the user has visited</li><li>Access both high and normal resolution favicons</li><li>Render information about the user’s recent activity (recent page visits, downloads, saves to Pocket, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>So while at first glance, this appears to be a static page of just images and text, rest assured that the page can do much more.</p>



<p>Like the Firefox Developer Tools UI, about:home is written with the help of the React and Redux libraries. This has allowed the about:home development team to create sophisticated, reusable, and composable components that could be easily tested using modern JavaScript testing methods.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this complexity and customizability comes at a cost. The page needs to request a state object from the parent process in order to have the Redux store populated and to have React render it. Essentially, the page is dynamically rendering itself after the markup of the page loads.</p>



<p>Startup is a critical time for an application. The user has expressed a need for their browser, and we have an obligation to serve the user as quickly and efficiently as possible. The user’s time is a resource that we should not squander. Similarly, because so much needs to occur during startup,<sup id="rf2-3036"><a href="#fn2-3036" title="You can think of startup like a traveling circus coming to town. You have to get the trucks and trailers parked, get the tents set up, hook up power, then lighting and sound … it’s a big, complex operation, and we haven’t even shot a clown out of a cannon yet." rel="footnote">2</a></sup> disk reads, disk writes, and CPU time are also considered precious resources. They should only be used if there’s no other choice.</p>



<p>In this case, we believed that the CPU time and disk accesses spent constructing the state object and dynamically rendering the about:home page was competing with all of the other CPU and disk access happening during startup, and this was slowing us down from presenting about:home to the user in a timely way.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, in my mind there are four broad approaches to performance problems once a bottleneck has been identified.</p>



<ul><li>You can widen the bottleneck (make the operations more efficient)</li><li>You can divide the bottleneck (split the work into smaller slices that can be done over a longer period of time with rests in between)</li><li>You can move the bottleneck (defer work until later when it seems that there is less competition for resources, or move it to a different thread)</li><li>You can remove the bottleneck (don’t do the work)</li></ul>



<p>We started by trying to apply the last two approaches, wondering what startup performance would be like if the page did not render itself dynamically, but was instead a static page generated periodically and pulled off of the disk at startup.</p>



<h2>Prototype when possible</h2>



<p>The first step to improving something is finding a way to measure it. Thankfully, we already have a number of logged measurements for startup. One of those measurements gives us the time from process start to rendering the Top Sites section of about:home. This is not a perfect measurement—ideally, we’d measure to the point that the page finally “settles” and stops changing<sup id="rf3-3036"><a href="#fn3-3036" title="<a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637024&quot;>We’re working on something like that</a>" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>—but for this project, this measurement served our purposes.</p>



<p>Before investing a bunch of time into a potential improvement, it’s usually a good idea to try to see if what you’re gaining is worth the development time. It’s not always possible to build a prototype for performance improvements, but in this case it was.</p>



<p>The team quickly threw together a static copy of about:home and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352">hacked together a patch to load that document during startup, rather than dynamically rendering the page</a>. We then tested that page on our reference hardware. As of this writing, it’s been about five months since that test was done, but <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614352#c2">according to this comment</a>, the prototype yielded what appears to be an almost 20% win on time from process start to about:home painting Top Sites.</p>



<p>So, with that information, we thought we had a real improvement opportunity here. We decided to proceed with the idea, and began a long arduous search for “the right way to do it.”</p>



<h2>Pre-production</h2>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, about:home is complex. The infrastructure that powers it is complex. Coupled with the fact that no one on the Firefox Front-End Performance team had spent much time studying React and Redux meant that we had a lot of learning to do.</p>



<p>The first step was to get some React and Redux fundamentals under our belt. This meant building some small toy applications and getting familiar with the framework idioms and how things are organized.</p>



<p>With that grounding, the next step was to start reading the code — starting from the entrypoint into the code that powers about:home when the browser starts. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">This was an intense period of study</a> that branched into many different directions. Part of the complexity was because much of the code is asynchronous and launched work on different threads, which introduced some non-determinism. While it is generally good for responsiveness to move work off of the main thread, it can lead to some complex reading and interpretation of the code when more than two threads are involved.</p>



<p>A tool we used during this analysis was the <a href="https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/">Firefox Profiler</a>, to get a realistic sense of the order of executions during startup. These profiles helped to inform much of our reading of the code.</p>



<p>This analysis helped us solidify our mental model of how about:home loads. With that model in place, it was much easier to propose practical approaches for introducing a static about:home document into the ecosystem of pre-existing code. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvDPcdqaZ7140nabNonQpD5Ln_nrAcJGBgFCJFG_0MM/edit#heading=h.1w5efh70rcvh">The Firefox Front-End Performance team documented our findings and recommendations</a> and then presented them to the team that originally built the about:home system to ensure that we were all on the same page and that we hadn’t missed anything critical. They were already aware that we were investigating potential performance improvements, and had very useful feedback for us, as well as historical product decision context that clarified our understanding.</p>



<p>Critically, we presented our recommendation for loading a static about:home page at startup and ensured that there were no upcoming plans for about:home that would break our mental model or render the recommendation no longer valid. Thankfully, it sounded like we were aligned and fine to proceed with our plan.</p>



<p>So what was the plan? We knew that since about:home is quite dynamic and can change over time<sup id="rf4-3036"><a href="#fn4-3036" title="As the user browses, bookmarks and downloads things, their Highlights and Top Sites sections might change. If Pocket is enabled, new stories will also be downloaded periodically." rel="footnote">4</a></sup> we needed a startup cache for about:home that could be periodically updated during the course of a browsing session. We would then load from that cache at startup. Clearly, I’m glossing over some details here, but that was the general plan.</p>



<p>As usual, no plan survives breakfast, and as we started to architect our solution, we identified things we would need to change along the way.</p>



<h2>Development</h2>



<p>We knew that the process that loads about:home would need to be able to read from the about:home startup cache. We also knew that about:home can potentially contain information about what pages the user has visited, and that about:home can do privileged things that normal web pages cannot. It seemed that this project would be a good opportunity to finish a project that was started (and mothballed) a year or so earlier: creating a special privileged content process for about:home. We would load about:home in that process, and add assertions to ensure that privileged actions from about:home could only happen from that content process type<sup id="rf5-3036"><a href="#fn5-3036" title="It’s vitally important that content processes have limited abilities. That way, if they’re ever compromised by a bad actor, there are limits to what damage they can do. The assertions mentioned in this case mean that if a compromised content process tries to “pretend” to be the privileged about content process by sending one of its messages, that the parent process will terminate that content process immediately." rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>



<p>So getting the “privileged about content process”<sup id="rf6-3036"><a href="#fn6-3036" title="Naming is hard." rel="footnote">6</a></sup> fixed up and ready for shipping was the first step.</p>



<p>This also paved the way for …</p></div></div>

The 894 GB database contains the following user information :</p><ul><li>Account passwords in plaintext</li><li>VPN session secrets and tokens</li><li>IP addresses of both user devices and the VPN servers they connected to</li><li>Connection timestamps</li><li>Geo-tags</li><li>Device and OS description</li></ul><h2>UFO VPN’s strict no-logging policy</h2><p>UFO VPN is owned by Hong Kong-based ToolsForest Ltd. and has a<a href="https://ufovpn.io/privacy"> strict no-logging policy</a> and states that any data it collects is anonymized. But it looks like the user data is far from being anonymized. Comparitech researchers say that “based on the contents of the database, users’ information does not appear to be anonymous at all.”</p><p>The company though has a different explanation “In this server, all the collected information is anonymous and only be used for analyzing the user’s network performance &amp; problems to improve service quality. So far, no information has been leaked,” the company told Comparitech.</p><p>How much UFO VPN cares for the user data can also be seen from the fact that Comparitech reported the data exposure to it on 1st July and the database was secured on 15 July. The company told Comparitech that, “due to personnel changes caused by COVID-19, we’ve not found bugs in server firewall rules immediately, which will lead to the potential risk of being hacked.

<p>Mastering tools is a must-have in any profession. Can you imagine a construction worker trying to find a button to start a drill each time he needs to use it? Or a violinist trying to find appropriate strings while performing Beethoven's Violin Sonata no.9? It comes striking to me that so many software engineers with years of experience still struggle with something they do many times every day – typing.</p>

<p>Learning touch typing was a life changer for me, and I was the same. I always postponed practicing it, so after a few years of working in the industry, I almost developed my way of typing – not that efficient but still – using more than two fingers.</p>

<p>One day I've said enough is enough and started practicing a few minutes every day.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/EDFKxd7.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can see I suck on creating habits and had a few approaches to practice sessions, but the 1st of August 2016 was the day for me.</p>

<p>After intensive practice weeks, you can see how the frequency of practicing has dropper but has not stopped, which is a key to keep up your fingers in good shape.</p>

<p>I still do a few minutes of practice every day after those four years. I can say it becomes a habit of mine. It became my first conscious habit where the end goal was to get some skill.</p>

<p>I've tried many times to build up a good habit and failed miserably, I've wanted to read a few minutes a week, do learning for a few minutes, learn languages. The problem was that I was not using those skills in my day to day routine (I've been focusing on too much at once too); hence the only time I was exposed to those skills were those few minutes a day. And forgot about it for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Some learnings from keeping my habits for a few years:</p>
<ul><li><p>I've learned a lot about myself and how should I approach any task that I'd like to become a habit of mine (I successfully do WaniKani lessons for three years now almost every day), most important thing is to use the skills you practice also outside the practice sessions (even when you use it inefficiently for the time being)</p></li>

<li><p>The habit should have a practical influence on how you work or live, having vague habit as “reading 10 minutes every day” does not work for me at all as I cannot see a clear goal of doing so (“getting wiser” is as vague as the habit itself). On the other hand, “learn how Ruby works under the hood by reading Ruby Under the Microscope book” makes much more sense to me. I have to quantify the habit to see the progress.</p></li>

<li><p>As long as the feeling of accomplishment is excellent (especially if you keep your streak for 365 days), the burden you put on yourself by forcing a habit is even more critical. It can undermine the whole plan – keep in mind you are doing it for fun and profit, not because it is a punishment. If you have to take a break, take it.</p></li></ul>

<p>Build up your habits and more importantly use skills learned, otherwise there is no point of having a habit at all.</p>

		<p>Wit Sumathavanit has recently started to pivot from offline to online entrepreneurship. But before that, he tried to build a juice business in Bangkok.</p><p>We're here to talk about what went wrong with his approach, what were the lessons learned, and how those learnings impacted their process to validate new ideas.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Wit Sumathavanit" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/bSE6FBmB_400x400.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="can-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-background-and-what-are-you-currently-working-on">Can you tell us a bit about your background and what are you currently working on?</h3><p>I’m Wit and I’m based in Bangkok. I have a family business in the hospitality and travel industry. I'm on the corporate B2B side, which hasn't been doing much since the pandemic started. I turned myself into the digital business world, where I’m learning to get started with projects and see what happens.</p><p>My first idea was to have a digital marketing service for products, course creators, or any other companies that wanted to advertise. I connected them with newsletters because I believe that newsletters are under-monetized. There are many good newsletter creators out there who are working hard to build an audience, but they don't have a good monetization strategy. The great thing about newsletters is that they are very targeted. It's very powerful because is highly targeted compared to online ads on Facebook or Google. It's a win-win for advertisers to connect with audiences that are relevant to them.</p><p>I'm running a solo <a href="https://www.witwunder.com/">no-code agency</a> now. I'm a freelance for growth tools, database/spreadsheet, and automation.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-to-build-your-juice-startup-what-was-the-motivation-behind-it">How did you come up with the idea to build your juice startup? What was the motivation behind it?</h3><p>After a long day of trying to get a ghost restaurant off the ground, my brain made the connection to something that might have untapped market potentials: Asian bitter melons. I tried a plain bitter melon drink and choked. It’s named “bitter melons” because they’re so darn bitter. It’s one of those foods that scientifically proven to lower blood sugar and a host of other health benefits.</p><p>A quick maths in my head revealed that tens of thousands of diabetics and those at-risk would have the need for daily doses of magic lower blood sugar juice. If only someone would be able to make a bitter melon juice that went from choke to death to barely drinkable, it will sell like crazy. I went all-in without validating the idea.</p><h3 id="how-did-you-build-it">How did you build it?</h3><p>It was almost all on the supply side. Thanks to the magic of e-commerce, I could do next-day home delivery of commercial-grade vertical cold press juicer and an excellent horizontal cold press juicer. I spent $2000 on shiny machines to extract natural goodness.</p><p>I spent the next 3 weeks googling juice combinations and recipes. Navigating the messy and inconvenient organic produce ecosystem of Bangkok. Most merchants of “organic produce” don’t know where their stuff comes from. I had sampled liters of fresh juice, which actually produced great results for my body. It was done. I came up with the secret commercial recipe that made bitter melon juice barely drinkable. That wasn’t enough, I came up with more recipes of health-boosting cold press juice. Ginger, turmeric, garlic, and white mugwort to name a few. Turns out those are also not needed because the market is not that big.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Bitter Melon Juice" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/bittermelon-capsicum-1.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The only way to get my juice to people was to use a delivery app. It turns out the cost of delivering juice is the same as the cost of the juice. I tried to package them as shot. They're very small because they're strong. The pricing doesn't work out because I cannot charge for them as a premium beverage. It's a physical business, the profit margin is not very high because you need manpower and you need to work with fresh ingredients.</p><h3 id="what-were-your-key-levers-to-start-growing-it">What were your key levers to start growing it?</h3><p>I sent samples to selected healthy juice enthusiasts, diabetic-risk people, health-conscious people. The results ranged from “This is actually OK” to “I’d rather not touch it ever again even for free”.</p><h3 id="what-were-the-biggest-challenges-you-had-to-overcome">What were the biggest challenges you had to overcome?</h3><p>To break-even, I needed to sell more than 500 bottles priced at Starbucks espresso. One person can only drink one 80 ml bottle per day. So, I needed to sell to 50 highly committed customers just to not make a loss.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
<img alt="Ginger Lime" src="https://phoenixdown.co/content/images/2020/07/ginger-lime.jpg">
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="how-did-you-realize-the-project-was-not-going-in-the-right-direction">How did you realize the project was not going in the right direction?</h3><p>Once I got to the point of calculating how many bottles I had to sell until this became a profitable project. That’s when I decided to pull the plug on the experiment before it got more carried away. Watching interviews of long-standing juice businesses in the space revealed that people with $50,000+ worth of juice machines serving several hundreds of bottles daily are very passionate about juice. They began with sizeable volume from day 1 because they have been hobbyist juicers who have been documenting their juicing for years before doing it commercially. The juice community sees them as influencers. They had relationships with customers from day 0.</p><blockquote>If I pursue it further I would have a new hobby, but I don't see it as a business.</blockquote><h3 id="did-you-achieve-any-revenue-in-the-end-how-much-money-did-you-lose">Did you achieve any revenue? In the end, how much money did you lose?</h3><p>I made $300 and the cost of the equipment was around $3,000. If I went forward, labor and shipping would probably have been a lot worse than that. After all, I lost at least $3,000 for the project.</p><h3 id="if-you-had-the-chance-to-start-over-what-would-you-do-in-a-different-way">If you had the chance to start over, what would you do in a different way?</h3><p>I would try to make an MVP first. Set up a Facebook or Instagram page and see if they're interested in healthy juices with a strong taste. Reach out to diabetic communities to see if they have an interest in juices like the one I made. I would have known people would prefer taking their current medication rather than a juice too difficult to drink.</p><p>Instead of 3 weeks of mixing juice, I should have spent 3 weeks of market research on juice enthusiasts in Bangkok and validating my assumptions directly with diabetic potential customers.</p><h3 id="from-all-your-takeaways-you-learned-from-this-experience-what-advice-do-you-have-for-other-entrepreneurs-who-want-to-get-started-or-are-just-starting-out">From all your takeaways you learned from this experience, what advice do you have for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?</h3><p>My main takeaway is to have customers from day 0. Call it pre-launch audience building, content marketing, whatever. It’s about having relationships as early as possible and nurture them.</p><blockquote>Solutions do not equal demand. Just because a healthy option is available doesn’t mean that people will choose it.</blockquote><p>Make a landing page and see if there's the problem that I'm looking to solve. Many of my ideas will not make any revenue but my cost of starting is zero. I can try out ideas fast. If my ideas fail, it’s fine because I’m not attached to it. We're not the ones to decide if ideas are good or not, it’s the market.</p><p>Validate your idea. Put it out there and see what happens. If it doesn't work out is fine too, because a lot of successful people failed the first time.</p><h3 id="what-are-your-favorite-startup-resources-for-makers-and-entrepreneurs">What are your favorite startup resources for makers and entrepreneurs? </h3><p><a href="https://nocodemvp.com/">NoCodeMVP</a> made by <a href="https://twitter.com/bramk">Bram Kanstein</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p>It’s hard to believe that its been more than 3 years since I opened <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000">RFC 2000</a>, which defined
the const generics for Rust. At the same time, reading the RFC thread, there’s also been a huge
amount of change in this area: for one thing, at the time the RFC was written, const fns weren’t
stable, and consts weren’t even being evaluated using miri yet. There’s been a lot of work over the
years on the const generics feature, but still nothing has shipped. However, I think we have defined
a very useful subset of const generics which is stable enough to ship in the near term.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <strong>const generics</strong> refers to generics that are constant values, rather
than types. This allows types to be parameterized by, for example, specific integer values. In
stable Rust, only the special array type - <code>[T; N]</code> - has a const parameter (the length of the
array), and there is no way to be abstract over all values of <code>N</code>, even for arrays. Const generics
will allow creating new types parameterized by values, as well as implementing traits and functions
that are abstract over those values. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// This is a custom type which is parameterized by a `usize`
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Foo</span><span>&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> 
</span><span>    </span><span>bytes</span>: <span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>],</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>// This is a trait which has been implemented for arrays of
</span><span>// any length.
</span><span></span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span>: <span>Debug</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>N</span>: <span>usize</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Debug</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>T</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>N</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>We’ve been using the const generics feature to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html#implementations">implement traits for arrays</a> for over a
year, artificially limiting the implementations to arrays of length 32. We are planning to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74060">lift
that limitation on those impls</a> in an upcoming release. By stabilizing const
generics, we could start to allow external crates to implement traits for all arrays as well, and
many other interesting use cases. There will be two important limitations, however.</p>
<h2 id="only-integral-primitive-types-for-const-generics">Only integral primitive types for const generics</h2>
<p>The initial types that a const generic can have will be limited to the integral primitive types.
That means the signed and unsigned integer types, booleans, and chars. For now, no compound or
user-defined types will be allowed, and no references (meaning no strings as well). This is a
relatively easy shortcoming of the current implementation to fix, and user defined types for const
generics will be possible in the nearer, rather than longer term.</p>
<p>I want to mention, since a lot of people aren’t aware of this, that not <em>any</em> type can be used as a
const parameter, even setting aside the current limitations of rustc. Importantly, in order for
Rust’s type system to be sound, equality between two types must be deterministic, reflexive,
symmetric, and so on. That is, if your custom type implements equality by flipping a coin, two
values of that type will sometimes be equal to one another and sometimes not. This will mean, two
types parameterized by those values will sometimes be the same type and sometimes a different type.
This would be quite troubling for the type system.</p>
<p>(As a concrete example, floating point numbers present challenges with the fact that <code>Foo&lt;NaN&gt;</code>, for
example, would not be considered the same type as itself, because <code>NaN</code> is not equal to itself.)</p>
<p>The long term solution to this is a notion of “structural equality,” which is a strictly correct
subset of <code>Eq</code> types that meet the properties needed for use in the type system. Rust already uses
this structural equality property when implementing matching. If you derive Eq and PartialEq for
your type and all its members, it should meet the structural equality property needed to be used in
matches and const generics.</p>
<h2 id="no-complex-expressions-based-on-generic-types-or-consts">No complex expressions based on generic types or consts</h2>
<p>The other limitation will be that only two kinds of expressions can be used to fill in a const
generic position:</p>
<ol>
<li>A const generic parameter. For example, in an <code>impl&lt;const N: usize&gt;</code>, where an const generic has
been introduced, that value can be used literally to fill a const generic.</li>
<li>An expression that can be used in a const context which does not depend on any type or const
parameters. This means literals, math equations, using consts, calling const fns, etc, as long
as no free generics are involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>This limits a lot of the more exotic and interesting things users want to do with const generics.
You can’t, for example, combine two array lengths together to form an array with type
<code>[T; N + M]</code>, or even double an array length with <code>[T; N * 2]</code>. You basically can’t have a type
that depends on computation that depends on other generics. Implementing this behavior soundly and
correctly is really the hard part of implementing const generics, and while work is ongoing, it
isn’t ready yet.</p>
<p>This also means that const generics can’t be filled in based on associated types, associated consts,
or generic methods. No functions that return <code>[u8; mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;()]</code>, no use of <code>Self</code> like
<code>[u8; Self::LEN]</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This will mean, for example, that use cases like cryptographic hash traits which allow each
implementation to specify a different length for the hash they output will still be out of scope for
the MVP. This is a shame, but this feature will come eventually.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-be-able-to-do">What you <em>will</em> be able to do</h2>
<p>All of these restrictions might sound like the feature is pretty limited, but I think users will
find a lot of really powerful use cases for it once they can play around with it. For one thing,
traits that today might be implemented only by some array types, or not at all, will begin to be
implemented by all arrays, making arrays a much more first class part of the language. And <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74373">we’re
already finding awesome use cases</a>. Look at this code sample.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve worked out what we could stabilize in the near future, I am working up hype and
consensus aroud the vision of stabilizing this feature - that’s what this blog post is for! The next
steps will be for someone to carve out a feature gate which is this limited set of const generics
(as opposed to the existing whole <code>const_generics</code> feature gate) and then for us to go through the
standard procedure for documenting and stabilizing that feature gate.</p>
<h2 id="credit">Credit</h2>
<p>My own involvement in const generics between the RFC and now has been minimal to non-existent.
Essentially, my role (both in the RFC and now) has been to identify a scope we can get consensus on
moving forward with. However, the hard work of implementing const generics has been going on for
years in between then, and I want to credit especially the contributors <a href="http://github.com/eddyb">eddyb</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/varkor">varkor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lcnr">lcnr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">oli-obk</a> for their work on implementing this highly
requested feature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>It has been said that there are two things hard in software development,
naming things and cache invalidation (while some add off-by-one errors
to the mix).
I believe that keeping the cache in sync with the source of truth might
count as a third one.
In this post, I'd like to tackle this issue, describe the ideal
situation -
1 cache, 1 datastore, describe the problem of having multiple components
that can write to the datastore, list all possible solutions, and
describe one elegant solution based on Change Data Capture and Jet.</p>
<h2>The ideal design</h2>
<p>In a system, to improve performance, one of the first short-term
measures is to set up a cache.
It's a tradeoff between getting the data faster at the cost of the data
being not that fresh: one loads the data in-memory close to the
consumer, and presto, one gets an instant performance boost. In regard
to a database, this is akin to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-starting-architecture.svg" alt="Starting architecture"></p>
<p>In this read-through design, when the app requires an item, the cache
first checks whether it has it.
If yes, it returns it.
If not, it fetches it from the underlying Relational Database Management
System, stores it, and returns it.
For a write, it stores it, and also calls the RDBMS to store it.</p>
<p>Note that using a cache-aside design instead of read-through would have
the same issue.
The only difference would be the fact that the app would be responsible
for the fetching/storing logic instead of the cache.</p>
<p>The RDBMS is the sole source of truth - as it should be. Since the cache
intercepts write statements to the RDBMS, it's a mirror of the data.</p>
<h2>Handling third-party database updates</h2>
<p>This design works as expected until the database receives updates from
another source:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-updating-database-bypassing-cache.svg" alt="Updating the database while bypassing the
cache"></p>
<p>Now, the RDBMS is still the source of truth, but the cache is not aware
of changes made by other components.
Hence, it might (will) return data that it has stored, but that is stale
compared to what is the source of truth in the RDBMS.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to cope with this issue.</p>
<h3>Cache invalidation</h3>
<p>Since the cache only queries the RDBMS if it doesn't store the requested
item, let's remove items after a specific time.
This is a built-in feature in enterprise-grade caches such as Hazelcast
IMDG, and it is known as the Time-To-Live.
When an item is stored, a TTL can be attached to it.
After that time has elapsed, the item is removed from the cache, and it
will be fetched from the RDBMS again if needed.</p>
<p>This approach has a couple of downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an item is not updated in the RDBMS, but is evicted from the
cache, then there's an extra query from the cache to the RDBMS when it's
needed by the app.
This is a net loss of resources.</li>
<li>If an item is updated in the RDBMS, but its TTL has not been reached
yet, then the cache will return the stale data.
This defeats the purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>With longer TTL, we avoid unnecessary round trips but return more stale
data.
With shorter TTL, we waste resources with lesser chances of stale data.</p>
<h3>Polling the RDBMS</h3>
<p>Because the TTL doesn't seem to be the right approach, we could devise a
dedicated component that watches the RDBMS by regularly sending queries
to it and updating the cache accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this strategy incurs the same issues as cache
invalidation:
the more frequent the queries, the more chances to catch changes, but
the more resources are wasted.
Worse, this also will put extra load on the RDBMS.</p>
<h3>RDBMS triggers</h3>
<p>A common downside of the above approaches is the way they both poll the
database.
Polling happens with a specific frequency, while writes don't follow any
regular periodicity.
Thus, it's not possible to make the two match.</p>
<p>Instead of polling, it would make much more sense to be event-driven:</p>
<ol>
<li>if no writes happen, there's no need to update the cache</li>
<li>if a write happens, then the relevant cache item should be updated
accordingly</li>
</ol>
<p>In RDBMS, this event-driven approach is implemented via <em>triggers</em>.
Triggers are dedicated stored procedures that are launched in response
to specific events, such as an <code>INSERT</code> or an <code>UPDATE</code>.</p>
<p>That works pretty well when the acted-upon object is inside the database
<em>e.g.</em> "when a record of table A is updated, then add a record to table
B".
For our use-case, where the acted-upon object is the cache, which sits
outside the database, it's not as simple.
For example, MySQL allows you to <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/faqs-triggers.html#faq-mysql-can-triggers-udf">make an external system call from a
trigger</a>.
However, this approach is very implementation-dependent and makes the
overall design of the system much more fragile.
Also, only some RDBMS implement triggers. Even if they do, there's no
standard implementation.</p>
<h2>Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>Wikipedia defines Change Data Capture (or CDC) as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] a set of software design patterns used to determine and track
the data that has changed so that action can be taken using the
changed data.</p>
<p>CDC is an approach to data integration that is based on the
identification, capture and delivery of the changes made to enterprise
data sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, CDC is a tool that allows to transform standard write
queries into events.
It implements it by "turning the database inside-out" (quote from Martin
Kleppmann).
This definition is because a database keeps a record of all changes in
an implementation-dependent append-only log.
Regularly, it uses it to manage its state. Some RDBMS also have other
usage <em>e.g.</em> MySQL uses the log for replication across nodes.</p>
<p>For example, here's a sample for MySQL binlog:</p>
<pre><code>### UPDATE `test`.`t`
### WHERE
###   @1=1 /* INT meta=0 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @2='apple' /* VARSTRING(20) meta=20 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @3=NULL /* VARSTRING(20) meta=0 nullable=1 is_null=1 */
### SET
###   @1=1 /* INT meta=0 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @2='pear' /* VARSTRING(20) meta=20 nullable=0 is_null=0 */
###   @3='2009:01:01' /* DATE meta=0 nullable=1 is_null=0 */
# at 569
#150112 21:40:14 server id 1  end_log_pos 617 CRC32 0xf134ad89
#Table_map: `test`.`t` mapped to number 251
# at 617
#150112 21:40:14 server id 1  end_log_pos 665 CRC32 0x87047106
#Delete_rows: table id 251 flags: STMT_END_F
</code></pre>
<p>A CDC component connects to this immutable log to extract change events.</p>
<p>One can view CDC as the opposite of Event Sourcing:
the latter captures state by aggregating events, while the former
extracts events "from the state".</p>
<h2>Debezium</h2>
<p>CDC is quite recent, and hasn't had time to mature.
As such, there's no universal standard, but specific tools.
In this section, we are going to have a look at
<a href="https://debezium.io/">Debezium</a>.
Debezium is an Open Source set of services for CDC provided by Red Hat.</p>
<p>Debezium is an umbrella term covering several components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Debezium Connectors are specific bridges that read the append-only
proprietary log for each supported database.
For example, there’s a connector for MySQL, one for MongoDB, one for
PostgreSQL, etc.</li>
<li>Each connector is also a Kafka Connect Source Connector:
this allows to easily output CDC events to one’s Kafka cluster</li>
<li>Finally, the Debezium Engine is a JAR that allows Debezium to be
embedded in one’s applications.
Note that even in that case, Debezium produces Kafka Connect-specific
content, which then needs to be handled and transformed in one’s
application.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Kafka is a great technology, and probably also quite widespread
nowadays, data in Kafka needs to be persisted to disk.
The benefit of persistence is that data survive even in the event of the
cluster going down.
The tradeoff, however, is that the access time of disk-persisted data is
one (or 2) orders of magnitude slower than the access time of in-memory
data, depending on the underlying disk technology.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet</h2>
<p><a href="https://jet-start.sh/">Hazelcast Jet</a> is a distributed stream
processing framework built on Hazelcast and combines a cache with
fault-tolerant data processing.
It has sources and sinks to integrate with several file, messaging and
database systems (such as Amazon S3, Kafka, message brokers and
relational databases).</p>
<p>Jet also provides a Debezium module where it can process change events
directly from the database, and write them to its distributed key-value
store.
This avoids having to write the intermediate messages to Kafka and then
read again to be written to a separate cache.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>It’s (finally!) time to assemble all the previous bits together.
Here are the components and their responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>A MySQL database instance is where the data is stored.
It’s accessed in read-only mode by the cache, and in write-only mode by
some external component</li>
<li>A Jet instance reads events to MySQL through the Debezium connector,
transforms them into cache-compatible key-value pairs, and updates the
cache accordingly.
Note that while Jet pipelines provide filtering capabilities, it’s also
possible to filter items in the CDC connector to optimize load of the
pipeline</li>
<li>The app uses the cache, which is always up-to-date with the database,
give or take the time it takes for the above to execute</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-07-16-architecture-with-cdc.svg" alt="Final architecture with
CDC"></p>
<p>Note that this architecture assumes one starts from a legacy state, with
an existing app that uses caching, where later on a new component was
set up that could update the database.</p>
<p>If one starts from scratch, it’s possible to simplify the above diagram
(and associated code) as Jet embeds its own Hazelcast instance.
In that case, instead of Jet being a client of a third-party Hazelcast
instance, Jet is the one to configure and start the instance.
Obviously, it also can then get/put data.</p>
<h2>Talk is cheap, show me the code</h2>
<p>Sources for this post are available <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/evergreen-cache">on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The repository is made of the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app</code> is a Spring Boot application using Spring Data JDBC to access a
MySQL database.
It abstracts away Hazelcast by using a Spring Cache layer</li>
<li><code>update</code> is a Spring Shell application.
It allows to update the data inside the database, with the cache none
the wiser</li>
<li><code>pipeline</code> is the Jet pipeline that listens to CDC events and update
the cache when data is updated</li>
</ul>
<p>The pipeline definition is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>pipeline<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>source<span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Medium was beautiful when it first launched. The <span>WYSIWYG</span> editor blew my mind. Ads didn’t cover the first three paragraphs. It’s where all the cool kids published.</p>
<p>Reading an article on Medium felt like getting an email from an @gmail.com address in 2004. <em><span></span><span>“</span>This person must know what’s up, they’re on Medium!”</em></p>
<p>The content was great. There were fantastic Federal Reserve breakdowns and Apple iPhone hot takes.</p>
<p>But when I land on Medium posts now, I find myself discounting the articles before I even read them. Perhaps it’s that every article has the same little M in the top left, the same h1 size and font and color, the same you’ve-reached-your-reading-limit pop-up. Perhaps it’s the fact that Jeff Bezos’ dick pic post lives next to JavaScript framework flamewars. Whatever the case, Medium’s layout no longer magnifies an aura of<span></span> <span>“</span>expertness” for its authors.</p>
<p>Substack feels a lot like Medium’s early days. It’s great they’ve made newslettering easy. I love reading blogs. But as the number of Twitter bios with Substack subdomains grows, my eagerness to click through is shrinking.</p>
<p>The problem is twofold.</p>
<p>First, there’s a signal problem.</p>
<p>Medium used to amplify credibility. Now I find the opposite to be true for me. <em><span></span><span>“</span>Oh this person just throws stuff on Medium? Probably not worth my time.”</em> X-out.</p>
<p>Second, there’s a visual memory problem.</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for unique <span>CSS</span>. As pretentious as that sounds, it’s not a conscious judgment. Daring Fireball’s grey background is soothing. The big green Marginal Revolution monster is endearing. It’s easy to find Paul Graham’s article in my tabs: it’s the only Yahooo! favicon.</p>
<p>Substack’s (and Medium’s) locked layouts mean I look past the author, read the post, and then move on. It’s similar to Spotify’s Discover Weekly. Despite listening to the playlist on repeat, I can’t name a single artist from it.</p>
<p>People who already have a huge audience will likely succeed massively with Substack. The experience is easy. It’s thoughtful. It’s simple. Lowering the bar for online publishing is fantastic. I am cheering for them.</p>
<p>But I hope I don’t find myself groaning when I click on Substack links.</p>
<p>Medium became a victim of its own success. Too much noise, not enough signal. I wonder how Substack can avoid the same fate.</p>

I'm Daniel Bryant. I'd like to welcome you to the Ambassador Livin' on the Edge Podcast, the show that focuses on all things related to cloud-native platforms, creating effective developer workflows, and building modern APIs. Today I'm joined by Dave Sudia, senior DevOps engineer at GoSpotCheck.</p><p>Daniel (00:18):</p><p>I've been following Dave's work for the past couple of years. I was lucky enough to get to see in person his presentation with colleague, Toni Rib, at KubeCon San Diego last year, where they focused on the GoSpotCheck move from Heroku onto Kubernetes. After the presentation, Dave dropped by the Datawire booth. My colleague Rafi and I had a great chat with him. He clearly understood both the theory and the practicality of building a platform for an organization that is constantly evolving. Rafi and I learned a bunch.</p><p>Daniel (00:42):</p><p>Today we're talking about how Dave and his team at GoSpotCheck have focused on enabling engineers to develop apps effectively in a local development environment, assembling a PaaS-like Kubernetes platform with open-source components, particularly CNCF components, and enabling self-service around the bigger picture of API contract testing, infrastructure provisioning and deployment. Hello, Dave, and welcome to the Livin' on the Edge Podcast. Thanks for joining us today.</p><p>Dave (01:03):</p><p>Thanks for having me.</p><p>Daniel (01:04):</p><p>Could you briefly introduce yourself for the listeners and share a recent career highlight as well, please?</p><p>Dave (01:09):</p><p>Yeah. I'm Dave Sudia. I'm a senior DevOps engineer at GoSpotCheck. We're a startup based in Denver, Colorado. I think the career highlight was being on Deserted Island DevOps conference that happened in Animal Crossing a couple months ago.</p><p>Daniel (01:24):</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Dave (01:25):</p><p>I don't know that I'm ever going to top that. That was super fun. It was put together by Austin Parker, who's in dev relations at LightStep. We went to his island in Animal Crossing and he had this crazy open broadcast studio set up, where we were talking in Zoom and he overlaid our audio onto the capture from his Switch, so you could watch us presenting in Animal Crossing. If you haven't seen it, I'll send you a link. It was just the most fun, wacky, thing. It was great.</p><p>Daniel (01:53):</p><p>Fantastic. You and I chatted quite a bit in San Diego last year at KubeCon, where you presented with your colleague, Toni Rib, Balancing Power and Pain: Moving a Startup From a PaaS to Kubernetes. I learned a bunch from that talk. Fantastic talk. We then caught up on the InfoQ Podcast and went a bit deeper into those topics. I'm guessing today really is part three of our discussion, but I was thinking for today, it'd be good to set a context for listeners of the GoSpotCheck platform, but then dive a bit more into the evolution of the platform, because I think you famously said you were assembling components versus building a platform, they're very different things, which I agree with. I think you've got some really great insight there.</p><p>Daniel (02:28):</p><p>Just to set the context, was running the GoSpotCheck app on a PaaS a good experience in the early years?</p><p>Dave (02:36):</p><p>Yeah. To recap, we started on Heroku. We ran there for many years. We were one of their largest customers by the time we started moving off. Their product is great. There are many things that we still miss about their product that we're now trying to rebuild internally. That is where I think most people should start, whether it's App Engine or Beanstalk or Heroku or any of those other more PaaS-type offerings. I think the thing I said in the last one is when you start there, you don't need my team. That's where your money is going, you're saving that economy of having to have a bunch of people who really understand how operations work. But at a certain point, you're going to get to a point where you need someone who really understands how operations work. You need features that aren't being offered by those platforms. Then you got to move.</p><p>Dave (03:29):</p><p>We shifted to Google Kubernetes engine as the primary place our apps landed, but what you lose is a lot of the sugar of a platform as a service. You lose the ease and the convenience. Last November, we had a hackathon. One of our lead developers, who runs a team, came up and said, "I don't really know exactly what I'm going to be doing for this hackathon, but it's going to be making this easier. This is all too hard." I heard that loud and clear. Making Kubernetes Easier was Bryan Liles' keynote at KubeCon last year. It’s not like it's going to get fixed in a hackathon.</p><p>Dave (04:13):</p><p>That's our push this year. We glued a bunch of tools together. How do we turn them into a more cohesive experience? It's never going to provide the convenience of git push Heroku master for a number of reasons, but how do we provide something that is just better, a little more seamless, a little easier to use?</p><p>Daniel (04:32):</p><p>Nice. Just take a step back. Initially the reason you looked at moving off Heroku was purely scale, I think, wasn't it?</p><p>Dave (04:39):</p><p>Yeah. It was scale and because of scale, feature. One of the big drivers was we used all their postgres instances and we just got to a point where the way that our queries were running, the performance characteristics of their databases just could not keep up with what we needed. We needed to shift our databases off. Then it was a cost perspective. When you're paying for my team, you shouldn't also be paying for Heroku. Then you're spending way too much.</p><p>Daniel (05:10):</p><p>Makes total sense. You mentioned assembling the …</p></div></main></div></div></div></div>

People can vote on different features so we know what’s most important for them. It’s easier for us to decide what to build if a lot of our users want something. Keep in mind though that in order to grow you have to do 3 things. Acquire more users, keep your current users happy (don’t let them churn) and expand the revenue from your current users.</p><p>We’re pretty good at attracting new users. Our growth rate has been 20% – 30% month over month in number of new users. June was actually the first month where new user growth was below 30%. July should be above 30% again.</p><p>Our revenue hasn’t grown by those numbers for one important reason: our churn rate is too high. We’re currently at about 10% churn rate. That’s too much.</p><p>We could focus on new features our current users want but that won’t stop the churn. People don’t leave because there’s something missing from a feature. People leave because their needs aren’t met. We’re not providing the AHA moment soon enough and we’re not helping them enough with their “Jobs to be done”.</p><p>We’re now focussing on getting people to that AHA / Magic moment sooner and sooner. We have a pretty good idea what that magic moment is although I think you can always improve and create new magic moments in your app.</p><p>The other lever you can pull is the new user lever. Making incremental changes to existing features won’t pull in new users. You’ll make your current users happy, yes. But don’t forget to make some bigger leaps on your product roadmap so you can capture a bigger market.</p><p>Keep pulling on these levers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>After Jenna discovered</strong> that her boyfriend was cheating on her, she went into an emotional tailspin. She was â€˜crying all the timeâ€™, struggled to attend her university classes, slept a lot and avoided situations she normally enjoyed.</p><p>In recounting her emotional reaction, Jenna stressed to me its unreasonableness. Given that she and her boyfriend hadnâ€™t been dating for long, she felt that she shouldnâ€™t have been so upset. After a month, she decided that something was seriously amiss and that she needed professional help. She recalled her psychiatrist diagnosing depression and telling her the problem might be caused by a chemical imbalance in her brain, for which she was prescribed an antidepressant.</p><p>Jenna found her emotional reactions jarring. They defied her basic assumptions about herself as confident, mature and self-sufficient. She told me she welcomed the diagnosis of a neurobiological disorder, which confirmed her problem was â€˜realâ€™ â€“ brought on by a physiological force external to her volition â€“ and that it showed sheâ€™s not â€˜just a slackerâ€™.</p><p>At the same time, Jenna was careful to distance her experience from that of people who are, in her words, â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜nutsâ€™. Their illness means a loss of control and ability to function. By contrast, she sees her problem as a common and minor glitch in neurochemistry. No one, she insisted, should mistake her for the mentally ill.</p><p>Jenna was one of 80 diverse volunteers that a research team at the University of Virginia and I interviewed in Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and two small cities in central Virginia. We wanted to find out how people deal with common forms of psychological distress and challenging circumstances, such as: shyness and nervousness in social situations; underperformance at work or school; struggles after the loss of a significant relationship; and disappointment with how their lives are unfolding. A majority of our interviewees had received some form of psychotherapy and/or been diagnosed with a condition such as depression, social anxiety disorder or attention deficit disorder, and prescribed a psychiatric medication.</p><p>It was striking that many (though not all) at least partly explained their distress in terms of biological causes, particularly a neurochemical imbalance. Yet thinking of their problems in this way was a fraught process. Like Jenna, many interviewees sharply distinguished themselves from the mentally ill and cast the mentally ill in a very negative light. This stigmatising of people with serious mental illness wasnâ€™t based on any first-hand experiences; rather, it was motivated by a desire to protect their own dignity and social standing. To justify the distinction between their own situation and mental illness, our interviewees rejected the idea that they had an â€˜illnessâ€™ as such, detached themselves from any formal diagnosis using statements such as â€˜thatâ€™s what the doctor calls itâ€™ or, in some cases, they avoided seeking medical help altogether.</p><p>For people like Jenna, who embraced a neurobiological explanation for their problems, this created a conundrum, which many of them resolved by creating a separate classification for their own experience â€“ what I have called a â€˜third conditionâ€™. The people we spoke to did not give this â€˜conditionâ€™ a name or explicit meaning. Rather it emerged in the rhetorical space opened up by the way they framed their personal struggle, distinguishing it from mental illness, on the one hand, and normality, on the other.</p><p><strong>Consider the perspective</strong> of another of our interviewees, a young woman Iâ€™ll call Piper, who had been diagnosed with depression. When â€˜you think mental illnessâ€™, according to Piper, â€˜you think schizophrenia and crazy people, and Iâ€™m not crazy, I just get really nervous.â€™ In making this distinction, interviewees like Piper and Jenna not only claimed that they were less impaired than the seriously mentally ill, they also insisted that their experience was categorially different. Piper said of herself that biologically something is just â€˜a little offâ€™. She has â€˜too little or too much or whatever it is that makes you have these issuesâ€™. Distinct from â€˜crazy peopleâ€™, she has control over her mind and her story. All she needs is a little pill. Yet at the same time, her â€˜conditionâ€™ is also different from the mundane challenges that normal people might face. Piper was adamant that her nervousness in social situations is different from ordinary shyness. Her taking of medication is warranted. She has a third condition caused by an â€˜imbalanceâ€™.</p><p>The â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ </p><p>To reconcile their perspective with the fact that they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, many interviewees credited a medical professional or a confidant for suggesting something like this third condition idea to them. Others emphasised the ordinariness of their experience and compared it to the types of routine problems that regular physicians treat. As one interviewee put it, â€˜all you have to do is take a pillâ€™.</p><p>There are echoes here of the messages conveyed in direct-to-consumer advertising for psychiatric medication. Iâ€™ve analysed the content of these adverts and found that distress, as listed in symptoms and portrayed in the patientsâ€™ stories, is often presented as a â€˜real medical conditionâ€™ and yet unlike mental illness. The ads contain no references to psychiatrists or to the diagnostic manual of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), nor use of phrases such as â€˜mental illnessâ€™ or â€˜mental disorderâ€™, and no depictions of those affected as anything but productive and successful citizens. In the words of our interviewees and in the advertising messages, the â€˜crazy peopleâ€™ are shadowy, depersonalised figures â€“ the damaged, uncontrolled â€˜otherâ€™ against whom the implicit comparisons are being drawn.</p><p>The views we encountered in our interviews are consistent with national surveys of public opinion about mental health. Today, with respect to mental health problems, the lay public much more freely endorses biological causes, the seeking of medical help and the use of psychoactive medications than in the past. Their views have converged with the biological perspectives long promoted in public campaigns to reduce the stigma of mental illness. According to the American anti-stigma organisation Bring Change to Mind, for instance: â€˜The fact is, a mental illness is a disorder of the brain â€“ your bodyâ€™s most important organ.â€™ Among anti-stigma researchers and activists, the evolution in public attitudes toward biological psychiatry has been celebrated as a sign that the public has at long last become â€˜literateâ€™, with a â€˜more scientificâ€™ even â€˜sophisticatedâ€™ understanding of mental illness.</p><p>In promoting a biogenetic causal theory, anti-stigma campaigners â€“ as well as psychiatrists, the popular media, and others â€“ hoped to convince people that mental illnesses are â€˜just likeâ€™ other chronic physical ailments, such as â€˜heart disease or diabetesâ€™, to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-mental-illness" target="_blank">quote</a> the APA, and could be medically addressed. This approach would, in turn, alleviate mental illness stigma and foster tolerance by reducing the (allegedly common) tendency to hold sufferers responsible for their condition. The result, it was confidently believed, would promote treatment optimism and increased help-seeking.</p><p>But something unexpected happened. The public embrace of neurobiology has not led to a more benevolent orientation toward the mentally ill. Rather, according to an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409431/" target="_blank">editorial</a> in the <em>Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience</em> in 2015, â€˜well-conducted studies have concluded, almost uniformlyâ€™ that the stigma-reduction strategy of recent decades, informed by â€˜biogenetic attribution of all mental disordersâ€™, has â€˜not only not worked, but also may have worsened public attitudes and behaviour toward those with mental illnessesâ€™. Such studies have shown that the growing endorsement of biological causation has continued to exacerbate the stigmatising of mental illness among the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/biogenetic-explanations-and-public-acceptance-of-mental-illness-systematic-review-of-population-studies/E6078EED07031B5828DB84FCDC90657F" target="_blank">general public</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20493559/" target="_blank">patients</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/17786" target="_blank">professionals</a>.</p><p>What accounts for this paradoxical result?</p><p><strong>I believe that </strong>our interviews reveal a crucial reason. While people accepted a neurobiological explanation for their problems, they struggled against the dehumanising notion that their thoughts, feelings or behaviour were mechanistically <em>caused.</em> Drawing on clinicians, drug ads and the popular media, the caricature of the seriously mentally ill served as a pivotal image by which to contrast and affirm their own control and self-determination. Millions of Americans â€“ and countless others in Western countries â€“ likely find themselves sharing this or a similar perspective.</p><p>The idea that oneâ€™s distress is primarily caused by a neurochemical deficiency that can be corrected by a drug is a fiction</p><p>As I argue in my <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo48408677.html" target="_blank">book</a> <em>Chemically Imbalanced</em> (2020), to defeat this othering and reduce stigma, clinical practice needs to move away from biogenetic causal language. Psychiatric research doesnâ€™t support the notion of simple cause and effect in mental health, instead uncovering a far more complex and indeterminate picture of vulnerabilities. There is no evidence to justify the continued promotion of one-dimensional theories such as â€˜chemical imbalanceâ€™. Nor does the beneficial use of psychiatric medicines require it. In fact, their precise mechanism of action and relation to troublesome experience <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00407/full" target="_blank">remains</a> a mystery. It would be more truthful for mental health professionals and public health campaigns to acknowledge this.</p><p>Itâ€™s true, as interviewees such as Jenna made clear, that patients often find biogenetic language appealing. It provides a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles. However, the …</p></div></div></div>

The following is an overview ofÂ&nbsp;<strong>why we set  up the system</strong>,Â&nbsp;<strong>our experience with it,</strong>Â&nbsp;<strong>what we have learned</strong>, andÂ&nbsp;<strong>where we see it continuing to go.</strong></p><p>This post is quite long, so before getting too far into the details....</p><h3>Total events collected: <mark>&gt;268 billion</mark></h3><h3>Data collected: <mark>&gt; 1.5pb (uncompressed)</mark></h3><h3>Event volume: <mark>~ 1 billion events/day</mark></h3><h3>Max Daily Throughput: <mark>~ 15k events/second (sustained during peak hours)</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct events: </strong><mark><strong>hundreds and hundreds</strong></mark></h3><h3>Infrastructure upgrade duration: <mark>less than two minutes with zero downtime</mark></h3><h3><strong>Distinct sites with Snowplow tracking: </strong><mark><strong>&gt; 180</strong></mark></h3><p><em>So let's dive in.</em></p><p>We chose Snowplow instead of building our own event tracking system, and plan to stick with it for the foreseeable future. Why? </p><h3><strong>We wanted to independently manage and scale data collection systems.</strong></h3><p>A conversation early in my tenure at CarGurus made a topic abundantly clear: many teams had a strong desire to separate concerns. At that time the company was growing quickly and demands were rapidly changing. Analysts and engineers were joining, onboarding fast, and asking completely new questions of our data. It was all-too-common to tell them their questions simply could not be answered due to the additional load tracking would place on production systems.</p><p>After being personally involved with a couple event-volume-related site outages, it was evident we needed to rethink data collection systems. We needed to be able to scale data collection infrastructure completely separately from application infrastructure, and we needed to significantly isolate the blast radius if something went wrong.</p><p>Snowplow was a strongÂ&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span>.</p><h3>We wanted to modernize event collection systems.</h3><p>Another requirement of choosing Snowplow was its ability to quickly and effectively introduce aÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lambda-architecture.net/">lambda architecture</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>into our analytics stack. As customer needs and demands evolved, we found that having both a real-time, low-latency (on the order of hundreds of milliseconds) component of the event pipeline as well as a batch-based, higher-latency (on the order of minutes) component gave usÂ&nbsp;significantÂ&nbsp;flexibility toÂ&nbsp;proactively fulfill stakeholder asks before they surfaced<em>.</em></p><p>Our pipelines are set up in AWS with <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a></strong> as transport and <strong><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a></strong> as long-term data storage. As stakeholders need real-time access to enriched data, Kinesis is the go-to location. If stakeholders need access to historical event data or want to augment it with other sources in the data warehouse, Snowflake is the place to go.</p><p>Snowplow allowed us to introduce new ideas and methodologies and fulfill both point-in-time and future stakeholder needs.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>The world of third-party tracking is rapidly changing and will continue to.</h3><p>As anyone involved in the world of client-side analytics is probably well-aware of, third-party tracking is increasingly going away. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html">this</a></strong>Â&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>andÂ&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">this</a></strong><strong>Â&nbsp;</strong>are fantastic for online privacy (and commendable), but have major implications for tracking and analytics. With an eye towards the future we knew we needed to decrease reliance on Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap, and all other similar third-party tracking systems if we wanted full insight into web traffic. We wanted 100% of site behavior instead of sampled GA or ad-blocked Adobe. And we wanted to own the resulting data.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to track first-party web activity and regain full visibility into usage behavior on our site.Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h3>Snowplow sets a high bar for fault-tolerance, redundancy, and durability.</h3><p>When set up properly, the Snowplow infrastructure isÂ&nbsp;extremelyÂ&nbsp;fault-tolerant. We set up ours in AWS and have not regretted it whatsoever.</p><p>Javascript tracking code buffers unsent events locally in the case of collection infrastructure being down. AWS application load balancers are multi-AZ and AWS maintains a good SLA for them. All access logs are retained for a period of time in case the load balancer is up but the rest of the system is down. Kinesis replicates data across three AZ's by default, and retention can be configured up to 168 hours in the case of mid-pipeline enrichment outages. S3 is highly durable and highly available by default. And the list goes on....</p><h3>We wanted to own all data that was generated.</h3><p>As mentioned above, if we were going to invest time and money building scalable event-collection infrastructure, <em>we simply</em>Â&nbsp;<em>had to own the outcome.</em>Â&nbsp;It is a significant investment to get large-scale infrastructure and instrumentation off the ground, and it's hard to do tracking in a way that doesn't impose a burden on analysts down the road (think <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events">Google Analytics events</a>).</p><p>We didn't want to deal with API rate limiting when attempting to recover our data. We didn't want to be tied to BigQuery, and we didn't want our customers' data flowing through other companies' systems.</p><h3>We needed to keep data quality high.</h3><p>When building out data collection and processing systems, it's one thing to set up infrastructure. It's a completely different story to keep quality high as priorities, teams, and customer demands shift. It's even harder to impose more work in an attempt to keep data "clean".</p><p>The way snowplow handles event validation and stream-redirection was a perfect fit in our case. After setting the system up we quickly found that leveraging <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#trackSelfDescribingEvent">Self-Describing Events</a>Â&nbsp;and the associated <a href="https://json-schema.org/">jsonschemas</a> empowered us to enforce data quality in a very low-friction way. Whenever events start flowing (with a bad push, etc) that don't adhere to the implementing party's jsonschema, they are redirected out of the "good" path for immediate review and recovery. Self-describing events (and jsonschemas) also gave us the ability to do some pretty neat automation, which will be covered later.</p><h3>The world of compliance is changing rapidly and we needed the ability to audit every piece of information.</h3><p>Since we first set up Snowplow the world has been forced to navigate two big data-privacy hurdles: <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>. Since we own and operate all collection infrastructure we did not need to get a third-party vendor DPA. Snowplow gives a significant amount of flexibility for enriching and redirecting PII, as well as configurable pseudonymization. It's good, it "just works", and it has saved us a considerable amount of time.</p><p>We've also spent a significant amount of time persisting full system lineage when splitting events into Snowflake which makes it easy to fully adhere to privacy legislation and associated requirements.</p><h3>We wanted to build, guide, and get out of the way.</h3><p>My favorite part about programming and tech isÂ&nbsp;building (machine) processes, cultivating good (human) habits, and getting out of the way. An early challenge was maintainingÂ&nbsp;clear, consistent definitions of data between frontend engineers (the implementer of tracking) and analysts (the stakeholders of said tracking). Event data was previously tracked, flowed through a number of different systems, and was often renamed (sometimes several times) when it finally landed in Snowflake.. Snowplow's self-describing events have allowed us to shift many conversations away from data pipeline engineers and back to where they should be taking place. I was able to back away since stakeholders and implementers were able to approach important conversations from a point of shared, consistent understanding.</p><h3>Last but not least, we needed to hit the ground running.</h3><p>While we may have had time to build out our own system from scratch, why build when you can lean on the backs of giants? The community of people contributing to Snowplow has grown significantly since the first time I implemented it, and people all over the world have run into almost every challenge imaginable. As fun as it would have been to deconstruct the system and build and implement our own,Â&nbsp;<em>it simply wasn't worth it.Â&nbsp;</em>Our stakeholders had questions that they wanted answered "yesterday" and their needs were our priority #1.</p><p>Snowplow enabled us to hit the ground running and answer real business questions "now".Â&nbsp;<span><a href="https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button/">âœ…</a></span></p><h2>Phase 1: Keep It Simple. Get It Running. Prove the System's Worth.</h2><p>When Snowplow was first rolled out there was a single mission in mind:Â&nbsp;<em>make sure it was a good organizational fit.Â&nbsp;</em>We had systems in place with some functional overlap already, so we had to make sure we weren't introducing a new system simply........ for the sake of introducing a new system. Or staking claim in others' territory. The system had to work. It had to answer questions that had been previously-unanswerable. It had to be robust. And it had to solve real-life challenges.</p><h3>We very consciously chose to<strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Automate all infrastructure.</strong> We wanted to scale, upgrade, and roll out entirely new sets of infrastructure fast. Everything was <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraformed</a>Â&nbsp;and infrastructure was 100% immutable.</p><p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> We could have gone straight to k8s or autoscaling clusters or ecs or eks or any other new (admittedly attractive) thing. But we didn't. We wanted to see how the system itself would perform and scale.</p><p><strong>Focus on the stakeholder.Â&nbsp;</strong>The only way this initiative was going to work was if others felt ownership of it, it decreased their pain, it empowered them to do their jobs better, or a combination of all. Instead of focusing on a hip/cool/hot/new systemÂ&nbsp;<em>we focused on answering the questions at hand.</em></p><h3>We initially choseÂ&nbsp;<strong>not to</strong><strong><em>:</em></strong></h3><p><strong>Pile on infrastructure complexity or over-optimize.</strong>Â&nbsp;We wanted to see how the system performed at scale when viewed under a magnifying lens. Since the best way to put a system through its paces is by minimizing complexity and other overhead, that's what we did. We wanted to know what goes wrong and potential system bottlenecks.</p><p><strong>Implement a widespread mandate.Â&nbsp;</strong>I strongly believe the most effective way to approach important conversations is with real-life (not theoretical) …</p></article></div>

<p>This is going to be a look at my philosophy and views on ActivityPub and why I believe the solutions to ActivityPub criticisms must come from communities. I believe there needs to be a clear way for communities to form and build upon the ActivityPub specification. The public needs to do so while keeping the cost to participate as close to zero as possible. At the end, I will present a concrete solution of extending ActivityPub to help organize its own extensions.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that the reader is familiar with the ActivityPub protocol or at least familiar enough such that I don’t need to give background information.</p>

<h2>Background: Go-fed and I</h2>

<p>I don’t expect folks to know me. On Mastodon I am <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">@cj@mastodon.technology</a>. I have been working on an ActivityPub library implementation in golang [<a href="https://go-fed.org/">go-fed</a>] for a little over a year. I started back in late November or early December of 2017, just before the ActivityPub spec matured. Due to the complicated technical solution required, it took me quite a long time to have a first release. It’s taken me another six or eight months to work toward the next major release of go-fed. Also, building a library means I don’t have direct end-users like other projects have. Honestly, I don’t mind. It has allowed me to think much more about general development practices around ActivityPub since my direct users are other software developers.</p>

<p>So please consider this post a year in the making.</p>

<h2>The Incomplete Philosophy &amp; Fediverse of Flavors</h2>

<p>I want to give an overview of a philosophy that I’ve adopted while working on ActivityPub. Succinctly: I view ActivityPub as a transport protocol that alone is not sufficient to build an application.</p>

<p>It’s not meant to dictate what an application is, nor its domain’s behaviors, nor its domain’s side effects. There are two kinds of federating: transmitting data and dictating peer app behavior. ActivityPub is a minimalistic protocol governing the sharing of information and the most sparse set of side effects in order to allow federation (transmission) between peers. It doesn’t dictate federation (app behavior) between peers for all domains. Anything more than just sending and receiving information needs to be built on top of ActivityPub as an extension.</p>

<p>ActivityPub alone is not a specification that solves all domain behaviors.</p>

<p>It has taken me a long time to realize this. ActivityPub doesn’t make it easy to adopt this philosophy because it also happens to contain its own “ActivityPub extension” specifically for the social media domain. This is why social media applications have adopted ActivityPub – the “ActivityPub extension” for the social media domain is itself embedded and hidden within the original ActivityPub specification. The ActivityPub specification handles both kinds of federating (transmission and app behavior) for the social media domain to a certain degree.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a code forge application would use ActivityPub to guarantee it can physically transmit and receive data federatively. But the ActivityPub specification alone is insufficient at dictating what other code forge applications may or may not do with the data. That requires building an ActivityPub extension by the code forge community. I think this is a fundamental issue that some folks have with ActivityPub. It does not dictate to peers what it may or may not do with the data they receive and the expectations around handling such data for other domains.</p>

<p>When looking at ActivityPub as an incomplete specification, there are some neat consequences. I have a cheesy metaphor for it. Building on ActivityPub allows creating different “flavors” of Fediverse: a social media one, an economic one, a code forge one, an educational one, and so on. Despite all the different flavors of Fediverse, they are all still a part of the same network. Developers may have their apps freely pick and choose which flavors of Fediverse to use to build the user experience they want from a single-flavor microblog to a multi-flavor code-forge-managed-by-an-economic-co-op. These “flavors” are simply different domains.</p>

<p>Also, each developer’s application doesn’t have to develop their own standard. They could, but I think it’s more preferable that each domain of the Fediverse builds one or more independent communities to standardize their specific solutions through the use of ActivityStreams extensions. Concretely, all that needs to be done is to define new ActivityStreams types and properties, as well as new expected behaviors when handling these types and properties. This is similar to Sections 6 and 7 of the ActivityPub specification. From there, developers would look only at the flavors they cared about and pick those additional behaviors to implement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the ActivityPub protocol was published there was neither guidance nor support on how to build these communities, how to develop more specialized domains, or how to organize more rigorous behaviors around the data being shared. And there still isn’t.</p>

<p>If this mindset seems alien or the philosophy is hard to take seriously, let’s step back and reframe ourselves. ActivityStreams comes as a form of RDF data known as JSON-LD. In contrast to the modern web which uses HTTP to serve and share hypertext documents linked together by hyperlinks, ActivityPub uses HTTP to serve and share structured-data JSON documents linked by IRIs. REST follows this model closely, so none of this is surprising. However, ActivityPub takes it one step further by specifying a way to transmit this data without having to build (or code generate) custom REST client endpoints. This is a key differentiator, but at a cost.</p>

<p>The cost is that developers who are used to an application-specific mindset struggle with viewing ActivityPub as a purposefully incomplete specification since it doesn’t specify federating (app behavior) in all domains. This is exacerbated by ActivityPub being touted as a complete specification. When comparing against application-specific REST APIs that are concrete, it makes sense that forcing ActivityPub upon this community is bound to generate criticisms along the vein of “it’s underspecified,” “it’s ambiguous,” and “look how I can write a broken compliant application.”</p>

<p>While I tend to view those particular kinds of criticisms as simply stemming from a philosophical difference, there are a lot of remaining criticisms I agree with. Issues such as security, discoverability, or lacking certain social media features. I really do think the next steps involve building the community of developers and interested non-technical folks in such a way that allows for multiple independent specifications to build off of ActivityPub.</p>

<h2>The Future: Addressing Criticisms &amp; Expanding Domains</h2>

<p>I don’t expect people to buy into my mindset or philosophy on what ActivityPub is and what those next steps should be. At minimum, I hope folks that reject it at least appreciate where I am coming from. I know it’s very easy to discuss general principles and philosophies, so now I would like to offer my own personal fantasy, in concrete terms, of what could be in store for the future. To do so, I need to identify the problems it is solving.</p>

<p>The first problem is getting different ActivityPub communities to self-organize to solve their own domain problems, build their own specifications on top of ActivityPub, and hold each other accountable at sticking to those specifications rigorously. A second problem is discoverability of these specifications for fellow developers without having a centralized organization hosting a registry or dictating a process. The cost of extending ActivityPub should always remain as close to zero as possible for numerous philosophical and moral reasons that I don’t want to get into here.</p>

<p>Note that there is some prior art. ForgeFed has solved the first problem by hosting a repository on GitHub and having a mailing list at Framasoft. They organized their own process and collaborated to build and create several proposals. So there is some evidence that existing tools can be sufficient for solving the self-organizing problem. However, it does not solve the second problem of getting would-be ActivityPub developers to discover these extensions.</p>

<p>My simple proposed fantasy is: Why not build on top of ActivityPub to solve both of these problems?</p>

<p>First, we as a community create an ActivityStreams extension and define behaviors to document the specifications built on top of ActivityPub. We now have a way to store ActivityPub extension specifications in the Fediverse itself. Next, building an application server that understands this extension and can federate it over ActivityPub means anyone can simply host an instance, allow users to register, build its community, and be free to draft new specifications on top of ActivityPub. Since this data is then federated by ActivityPub itself, it is reachable by both technical and non-technical users. There is neither a central authority nor a central registry as each community is responsible for its own ActivityPub specifications. This is the democratization of ActivityPub across all domains. People cannot have their ActivityPub extension specification censored. As long as the core ActivityPub protocol as currently written is followed, federation compatibility naturally leads to new domains and apps implementing them.</p>

<p>As hosts of these specs, we would all have to be good citizens and not purposefully and maliciously create specifications that collide namespaces or repurpose existing semantics from other specs in ways that are incompatible. Instances and specific specs may become blacklisted if obviously malicious. My fantasy solution does not solve these human problems, but it is not meant to. It’s meant to help facilitate human interactions. I concede this proposal will make protocol purists uncomfortable with the idea of bringing humanity so close to the heart of a technical process. I know some folks …</p></div></div></div>

This friendly, down-to-earth tutorial explains what generic functions and types are, why we need them, how they work in Go, and where we can use them. It's easy and fun, so let's dance!</p>
<p>(<em data-preserve-html-node="true">Note:The support for generics in Go that I describe here isn't yet released, and the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">proposal for how it would work</a> is under active development. Right now you can play with it in the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">generics-enabled version of the Go Playground</a>, or you can use the experimental <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a> to try Go's generics support in your own programs.</em>)</p>
<h2 id="what-are-generics-">What are generics?</h2>
<p>As you know, Go is a <em>typed</em> language, meaning that every variable and value in your program has some specific type, like <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>. When we write functions, we need to specify the type of their parameters in what's called the <em>function signature</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintString(s string) {</code></pre>
<p>Here, the parameter <code>s</code> is of type <code>string</code>. We can imagine writing similar versions of this function which take an <code>int</code>, a <code>float64</code>, an arbitrary struct type, and so on. But that would be inconvenient for more than a handful of specific types, and though we can sometimes use <em>interfaces</em> to solve this problem (as described in the <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, for example), that approach has many limitations.</p>
<h2 id="generic-functions-in-go">Generic functions in Go</h2>
<p>Instead, we would like to declare a <em>generic function</em> <code>PrintAnything</code>, which takes an argument of an arbitrary type T, and does something with it.</p>
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintAnything(type T)(thing T) {</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right? How do we call it? Equally simply:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything("Hello!")</code></pre>
<p>In the rare cases where Go can't guess what type T is based on the value we pass to the function, we can make it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>PrintAnything(int)(99)</code></pre>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>It's pretty easy to implement the <code>PrintAnything</code> function, because the <code>fmt</code> library can print anything anyway. Suppose we wanted to write our own version of something like <code>strings.Join</code>, which takes a slice of T, and returns a single string that joins them all together. Let's try:</p>
<pre><code>// I have a bad feeling about this.
func Join(type T)(things []T) (result string) {
    for _, v := range things {
        result += v.String()
    }
    return result
}</code></pre>
<p>We've created a generic function <code>Join()</code> which takes, for an arbitrary type T, a parameter which is a slice of T. Great, but now we run into a problem:</p>
<pre><code>output := Join([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
// v.String undefined (type bound for T has no method String)</code></pre><p>Thing is, inside the <code>Join()</code> function, we want to call <code>.String()</code> on each slice element <code>v</code> to turn it into a string. But Go needs to be able to check in advance that type T has a <code>String()</code> method, and since it doesn't know what T is, it can't do that!</p>
<p>What we need to do is <em>constrain</em> the type T slightly. Instead of accepting literally any type, we're really only interested in types which have a <code>String()</code> method. Any such type will be an acceptable input to our <code>Join()</code> function, so how do we express that constraint in Go? We use an <em>interface</em>:</p>
<pre><code>type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}</code></pre>
<p>This specifies that a given type has a <code>String()</code> method. So now we can apply this constraint to the type of our generic function:</p>
<pre><code>func Join(type T Stringer) ...</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Stringer</code> guarantees that any value of type T will have a <code>String()</code> method, Go will now happily let us call it inside the function. But if you try to call the <code>Join()</code> function with a slice of some type that <em>doesn't</em> satisfy <code>Stringer</code> (for example <code>int</code>), Go will complain:</p>
<pre><code>result := Join([]int{1, 2, 3})
// int does not satisfy Stringer (missing method String)</code></pre><h2 id="the-comparable-constraint">The <code>comparable</code> constraint</h2>
<p>Constraints based on method sets, like <code>Stringer</code>, are useful, but what if we want to do something with our generic input that doesn't involve calling a method?</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to write an <code>Equal</code> function which takes two parameters of type T, and return <code>true</code> if they are equal, or <code>false</code> otherwise. Let's have a go:</p>
<pre><code>// This won't work.
func Equal(type T)(a, b T) bool {
    return a == b
}

fmt.Println(Equal(1, 1))
// cannot compare a == b (operator == not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>This is the same kind of issue as we had in <code>Join()</code> with the <code>String()</code> method, but since we're not <em>calling</em> a method now, we can't use a constraint based on a method set. Instead, we need to constrain T to only types that work with the <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operators, which are known as <em>comparable</em> types. Fortunately there's a straightforward way to specify this: use the built-in <code>comparable</code> constraint.</p>
<pre><code>func Equal(type T comparable) ...</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-constraints-package">The <code>constraints</code> package</h2>
<p>Just to be difficult, suppose we want to do something with values of T which isn't either comparing them or calling methods on them. For example, suppose we want to write a <code>Max()</code> function for a generic type T which takes a slice of T and returns the element with the highest value. We might try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Nope.
func Max(type T)(input []T) (max T) {
    for _, v := range input {
        if v &gt; max {
            max = v
        }
    }
    return max
}</code></pre>
<p>I'm not feeling very optimistic about this, but let's see what happens:</p>
<pre><code>fmt.Println(Max([]int{1, 2, 3}))
// cannot compare v &gt; max (operator &gt; not defined for T)</code></pre>
<p>Again, Go can't prove ahead of time that the type T will work with the <code>&gt;</code> operator (that is to say, that T is <em>ordered</em>). How can we fix this? We could simply list every possible allowed type in a constraint, like this (known as a <em>type list</em>):</p>
<pre><code>type Ordered interface {
    type int, int8, int16, int32, int64,
        uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr,
        float32, float64,
        string
}</code></pre>
<p>Fortunately for your keyboard, this and other useful constraints are already defined for us in the standard library's <code>constraints</code> package, so we can import that and use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>func Max(type T constraints.Ordered) ...</code></pre>
<p>Problem solved!</p>
<h2 id="generic-types">Generic types</h2>
<p>So far, so cool. We know how to write functions that can take arguments of any type. But what if we want to create a <em>type</em> that can contain any type? For example, a 'slice of anything' type. That turns out to be very easy:</p>
<pre><code>type Bunch(type T) []T</code></pre>
<p>We're saying that for a given type T, a <code>Bunch(T)</code> is a slice of values of type T. For example, a <code>Bunch(int)</code> is a slice of <code>int</code>. We can create values of that type in the normal way:</p>
<pre><code>x := Bunch(int){1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Just as you'd expect, we can write generic functions which take generic types:</p>
<pre><code>func PrintBunch(type T)(b Bunch(T)) {</code></pre>
<p>Methods, too:</p>
<pre><code>func (b Bunch(T)) Print() {</code></pre>
<p>We can also apply constraints to generic types:</p>
<pre><code>type StringableBunch(type T Stringer) []T</code></pre>
<h2 id="golang-generics-playground">Golang generics playground</h2>
<p>So that you can play with the current implementation of the generics proposal (for example to try the code samples in this tutorial), the Go team have provided a generics-enabled version of the Go Playground here:</p>
<p><a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Golang generics playground</a></p>
<p>It works exactly the same way as the normal <a href="https://play.golang.org/">Go playground</a> we know and love, except that it supports the generic syntax described here. Because it's not possible to run all Go code in the playground (for example, code that makes network calls or accesses the filesystem), you can also try out the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/heads/dev.go2go/README.go2go.md">go2go tool</a>, which translates code using generics to code which compiles with the current version of Go.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h3 id="will-golang-get-generics-">Will Golang get generics?</h3>
<p>Almost certainly yes. The current proposal for generics support in Go, as outlined in this tutorial, was announced in June 2020 in a blog post: <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">The Next Step for Generics</a>, and is being evaluated by the community. Since Go's lack of generics has often been cited as holding back the more widespread adoption of Go, the reaction has been generally positive.</p>
<p>The Golang generics roadmap currently specifies a possible release date as early as Go version 1.17, which would be in August 2021 (but it may not be as soon as that, depending on how much the current proposal evolves based on feedback).</p>
<p>Until then you can use the <a href="https://go2goplay.golang.org/">Generics Playground</a> to experiment with it and try out the examples here.</p>
<h3 id="generics-vs-interfaces-are-there-alternatives-to-generics-">Generics vs interfaces: are there alternatives to generics?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/map-string-interface"><code>map[string]interface</code> tutorial</a>, we can already write Go code that handles values of any type, without using generic functions or types, by means of <em>interfaces</em>. However, if you want to write a library that implements things like collections of arbitrary types, using a generic type is much simpler and more convenient than using an interface.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-code-generation-instead-of-generics-">Can I use code generation instead of generics?</h3>
<p>The 'code generator' approach has been the other traditional way of dealing with such problems before the advent of generics in Go. Essentially, it involves using the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate"><code>go generate</code> tool</a> to produce Go code for each of the specific types that you need to handle in your library.</p>
<p>While this works, it's awkward to use, limited in its flexibility, and requires an extra build step. While code generation is still useful for some things, it's nice that we no longer have to use it to simulate generic functions and types in Go.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-contracts-">What are contracts?</h3>
<p>An earlier <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md">draft design</a> for generics in Go used a similar syntax to what we have today, but it implemented type constraints using a new keyword <code>contract</code>, instead of the existing <code>interface</code>. This was not popular for various reasons, and is now superseded.</p>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture. And philosophical liberals—those of us who believe in a pluralistic society that encourages ideological diversity—have the most principled reason to get on board.</p><p>Hatred of any form of wrong think now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9790764/partisan-discrimination">threatens the foundations</a> of our social fabric. Since the stakes of public policy debates are high, it is understandable—and even admirable—for citizens to subject each other’s views to vigorous criticism. But, if ordinary people fear that a minor misunderstanding or a deeply held difference of opinion might cost them their jobs, freedom of speech—the cornerstone of any liberal order—is under serious threat. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			<p>It’s 2020. The world is abuzz with, well – <em>waves hand</em> – all this. But it's
also abuzz with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a>: Apple is moving their Mac line to Apple Silicon, Amazon
has been been touting their Gravaton2-based infrastructure, Cloudflare is said
to be going all ARM on their edge nodes, and the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15869/new-1-supercomputer-fujitsus-fugaku-and-a64fx-take-arm-to-the-top-with-415-petaflops">world's fastest supercomputer
is built on ARM</a>.</p>
<p>For a long time, I – and I think many others – held the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86-64</a> is
for heavy workloads and ARM is for the "little stuff" like embedded systems and
Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>And that’s why you can find tons of articles online for how to cross-compile
Rust <em>from</em> x86-64 <em>to</em> ARM.</p>
<p>I want to cross-compile the other way.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://zenlist.com/">Zenlist</a>, we use Rust to run our entire fleet of lambdas (around 90 of
them).</p>
<p>Amazon has been talking up their beefy Gravaton2-based ARM instances. But right
now, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">lambda</a> – which feels to me like the "little stuff" because of their
low-memory/low-CPU settings – only runs on x86-64.</p>
<p>I decided we needed to figure out how to build our lambda runtimes from an ARM
server: I needed to cross-compile Rust <em>from</em> ARM <em>to</em> x86-64.</p>
<hr>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>I launched two Ubuntu 20.04 instances: a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6/">c6g.medium</a> for the build
machine and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/">t3.micro</a> as an x86-64 to run the results on. (Cut me some
slack here! Including how to compile and run on lambda would make this article
quite a bit longer!)</p>
<p>Log into that build machine and lets get started. A quick visit to <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup.rs</a>
to install Rust, of course.</p>
<p>And a <code>apt-get install -y build-essential</code> for all of the other tools we need.</p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new --bin crossed
$ cargo run
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>gets a nice little greeting printed the to the screen. We're in business!</p>
<h2>Cross compile!</h2>
<p>Alright, so now we want to cross compile this admittedly awesome project to run
on the target machine.</p>
<p>We'll start in the usual place: adding a new target.</p>
<pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>On lambda, it's nice to use the <code>musl</code> target to get everything statically
linked together.</p>
<p>Alright, let's give it a try.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit code: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Well bummer. I was really hoping that would Just Work™. No need to panic yet,
because I remember from reading other articles like <a href="https://rendered-obsolete.github.io/2019/03/19/rust_lambda.html">Rust on
Lambda</a> and <a href="https://sigmaris.info/blog/2019/02/cross-compiling-rust-on-mac-os-for-an-arm-linux-router/">Cross compiling Rust on Mac OS for an ARM
Linux router</a> that we probably just need to configure a
cross-compiling linker.</p>
<p>Alright, so we need to install a cross compiler.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>Then we need to set it up by throwing this in <code>~/.cargo/config</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc"
</code></pre>
<p>And now, <code>cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code> works
great!</p>
<h2>And it works on the target machine, right?</h2>
<p>Well, I had better make sure. That's why I spun up the target machine, after
all.</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>🎉🏆</p>
<h2>The author counts his chickens before they hatch</h2>
<p>So that's how to cross-compile for x86-64 lambda from an ARM machine! Publish
this post. <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/submit-URLs">Submit the sitemap to Google</a>. Actually, hey, we can
probably do that right from this project!</p>
<p>I'll just add <a href="https://docs.rs/reqwest">reqwest</a> to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.10", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls", "blocking"] }
</code></pre>
<p>And write up some quick code to notify Google that my sitemap has changed, and
it should index this clearly-complete-and-not-missing-anything article.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::default();
    let url = "http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://burgers.io/sitemap.xml";
    let status = client.get(url)
        .send()?
        .status();

    println!("{:?}", status);

    Ok(())
}

<p>And cross-compile it while I get a celebratory drink.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`
</code></pre>
<h2>Wait, what?</h2>
<p>Everything was sailing along so smoothly! What happened?</p>
<p>Not-rust happened.</p>
<p>I told <em>Cargo</em> about my cross-compiler. But <a href="https://docs.rs/ring">ring</a> – a crypto library that
reqwest uses – uses some code that isn't Rust, and it had no way to know about
my cross compiler.</p>
<p>Let's take a longer look at more of the error log.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
error: failed to run custom build command for `ring v0.16.15`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/ubuntu/crossed/target/release/build/ring-082dc03a36bb5ba5/build-script-build` (exit code: 101)

</code></pre>
<p>Yep, yep, looks good, target is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code>, host is
<code>aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, uh huh, yep, <strong>oh</strong>.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>There's an environment variable there – <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> – that
looks like it's expecting the exact cross-compiler to use. And it's empty.</p>
<p>Well, let's change that! Using the exact same cross-compiler that we specified
in the cargo config, let's set that environment variable.</p>
<pre><code>$ export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
</code></pre>
<p>And then 🤞.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>It worked! Throw it over to the target machine and give it a try!</p>
<pre><code>$ scp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/crossed ubuntu@target-machine:.
$ ssh ubuntu@target-machine ./crossed
200
</code></pre>
<p>Nice.</p>
<h2>Some final notes</h2>
<p>As bullet points? Why not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure <code>CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl</code> is permanently in your environment
somehow. For us, this involved adding it to the environment section for
self-hosted GitHub runners.</li>
<li>In my specific testing for our specific projects, compilation times were up
to about 10% slower than on a corresponding <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/">c5</a> instance. But the cost
tradeoff was worth it.</li>
<li>I'm holding out hope that AWS will give us ARM-based lambdas in the future.</li>
<li>No instances were harmed while writing this article. Well, except the ones I
terminated. Which reminds me to remind you: if you were following along at
home, now might be a good time to terminate your instances.</li>

<p>I got access the the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI GPT-3 API</a> and I have to say I’m blown away. It’s far more coherent than any AI language system I’ve ever tried. All you have to do is write a prompt and it’ll add text it thinks would plausibly follow. I’ve gotten it to write songs, stories, press releases, guitar tabs, interviews, essays, technical manuals. It’s hilarious and frightening. I feel like I’ve seen the future and that full AGI might not be too far away.</p>



<p>In each case below bold is the prompt I provided GPT-3, and the rest is all generated by the AI. In some cases I had to click generate a few times, and in about 2/3 of the examples I picked the best example after a few tries, but I generally didn’t have work too hard to get it to write amazingly coherent text given a simple prompts. Here are some of my favorites. </p>

<p><strong>Below is a screenplay for a film-noir hard boiled detective story by Raymond Chandler about the boy wizard Harry Potter:</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Harry Potter”</strong><br><strong>By Raymond Chandler</strong></p>



<p>Harry Potter, Private Eye.<br>Scene: A small dingy office, early morning, furniture of the Salvation Army store variety. Sordid atmosphere. Harry Potter, in ratty tweed suit, unpressed shirt, and unshined shoes, sits behind the desk looking haggard, rumpled, and embittered. In one corner of the office a torn shade rattles at the wind gusts outside. Harry has one long index finger on the butt of a .38 and he broods over a photograph. The photograph shows a gorgeous blonde wearing an evening gown. She is holding a cocktail in one hand and looking pensively at a cigarette in the other. A tear adorns her cheek. Harry looks at her for a long moment, sighs, then puts his gun down and stands. He straightens his clothes, scratches his head, then with more resolution turns around, picks up his pistol, and leaves the office. He passes through the front room and looks out the dirty window. An old woman is washing the sidewalk outside with a mop. A young man in a double breasted gray suit is leaning against the building. Harry sighs again and goes out the door. He walks up to the young man and without ceremony punches him in the jaw.</p>



<p><strong>Press Release: Anaheim, CA: President Kanye West declares Disney Land to be the new capital of the United States. Washington D.C. will be maintained as a museum.</strong><br>The move has been in the works since the mid-2000’s. <br>Advertisement <br>*2. Removes his sunglasses, revealing that he is no longer in any way blinded. <br>*3. Endorsed by Senator Kid Rock, who has also declared this new government of Disneyland will be paying for his divorce.<br>*4. An elaborate surgery will take place to repair Kanye’s “Diamond Tiara” tattoo, and reposition it to his forehead so that he can legally be recognized as a Princess. <br>Advertisement <br>*5. Joe Rogan has been picked to be the new Drug Czar. <br>“It’s long been established I’ve been Kanye’s gateway drug, so why not put me in a position of power,” Rogan said, clearly relishing his new position. “I have an in-depth understanding of the ways in which recreational drug use enhances one’s experience of life. I am deeply passionate about getting drugs to kids.” <br>*6. Kardashian sisters will no longer be known as The Kardashians. The family will change its name to The Wests. <br>*7. Kanye West’s new sports bra will no longer be known as a sports bra. It will be officially recognized as The West Bandit. <br>Advertisement <br>*8. President Kanye will announce that he has a new national anthem. The government-mandated anthem will be a modified version of Kanye’s 2007 hit “Stronger.” It will be played on a continuous loop at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Blood Song</strong><br><strong>By HP Lovecraft</strong></p>



<p><strong>The creeping chaos Nyarlathotep walks upon the earth while in his House at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. After eight seaons on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23TeamDaenerys">#TeamDaenerys</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyarlathotep is quite irritated with what he feels is a very hackneyed ending to Game of Thrones.</strong></p>



<p>On the third day of season eight, Nyarlathotep looks down upon his television and utters&nbsp;“What&nbsp;the hell are they doing?”At this point, Nyarlathotep goes on a long tirade about how the Starks were supposed to be there at the end. Instead we have Daenerys looking like she is going to set everything on fire. He tells his cult of followers that Daenerys’ actions are completely nonsensical and that it is completely disrespectful to not finish a story with all its main characters alive. He mentions that they should just burn down Winterfell because it makes no sense for her to even be there. It would make more sense if she flew in with Drogon and just burned King’s Landing. His followers start to get nervous when Nyarlathotep mentions he has always liked Cersei.</p>



<p><strong>Below is a pop song by Taylor Swift about the boy Wizard Harry Potter. </strong></p>

<p>Harry’s got glasses <br>He’s got those bright green eyes <br>Girls are always screaming </p>



<p>‘Cause he’s got that Potter hair </p>



<p>Even when he’s super stressed <br>He’s still got those supersonic cheekbones <br>I’m not surprised they made a movie </p>



<p>‘Cause I’d watch him anytime <br>Oh, yeah, Harry, baby, you’re my favorite character </p>



<p>I’d walk a thousand miles </p>



<p>To get to see you and </p>



<p>Harry, Harry, you’re so fine </p>



<p>My girly parts all tingle </p>

<p>I’d love to be your girl </p>



<p><strong>The following is an essay by Paul Graham on paulgraham.com on how to make Mars a startup hub</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Startups On Mar</strong>s<br><strong>By Paul Graham</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the sort of startup that might make a go of it on Mars:<br>One that makes money by taking advantage of local resources. For example, a startup that uses the Martian atmosphere to make fertilizer or methane fuel. A startup that sells water from Martian rivers. A startup that uses minerals from the Martian soil. A startup that uses solar power from the Martian sun. A startup that uses a new kind of solar panel that’s more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.<br>I would even invest in a startup that did nothing but extract the helium-3 from the Martian atmosphere and send it back to Earth.<br>If you can find a way to make money by using local resources, there’s probably a business there.<br>There’s another class of startups that might work on Mars:<br>Startups that produce services for other startups. For example, a startup that makes it easier to build rockets, or to extract gases from the Martian atmosphere, or to construct solar panels, or to farm the local soil.<br>Startups that make things more comfortable for colonists. For example, a startup that sells air conditioners, or houses. A startup that sells things to keep colonists entertained. A startup that provides Internet services.</p>



<p><strong>The following is a blog post from Slate Star Codex about the value of free speech and civility in a democratic society.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</strong><br><strong>By Scott Alexander</strong></p>



<p>I.<br>There’s a concept that comes up often in debates about free speech called&nbsp;“shouting&nbsp;fire in a crowded theater”. The basic idea is that you can’t just say whatever you want whenever you want – especially if it’s likely to cause panic. And the reason for this is obvious: panic leads to violence, and violence hurts people. If you are causing panic, then your right to free speech ends where the other person’s right to not get hurt begins.<br>But this isn’t really true. If shouting fire in a crowded theater were illegal, then there wouldn’t be any actual fires in theaters, would there? How could there be? If everyone knew that shouting fire …</p></div></div>

<p><em>After a protracted move to Portland (Oregon), I’m back to writing about parrots.</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Steve used to say to me, and he used to say this a lot. Hey Jony, here’s a dopey idea. And sometimes they were. Really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room. And they left us both completely silent. Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones. Which in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound. </p><cite>Jony Ive, Steve Jobs memorial service, Apple Campus, 2011</cite></blockquote>



<p>One of the secrets of Apple’s success comes in this wonderful quote from Jony Ive. The part he didn’t mention—partly because it wasn’t relevant to the story—is that sometimes the magnificent ideas came out of the dopey ideas. </p>



<p>All of us are capable of bold, crazy, or magnificent ideas, but if we’re not allowed the freedom to have dopey ideas and voice them, some of these potential ideas may never come to fruition.</p>



<p>The more years I worked at Apple, the more timid I felt people had become to bring up ideas that they had. I finally figured out that it was likely due to the average tenure of an employee dropping dramatically as hiring went increased exponentially.</p>



<p>Someone that has been at Apple for 10 years is certainly very secure in voicing ideas, whereas someone that has only been there less than 2 years is understandably more reticent.</p>



<p>So, I don’t think Apple’s culture of being open to dopey ideas has changed, but the average employee is less likely to bring them up. I think this is probably true of any company that has experienced insane growth.</p>



<p>But back to dopey ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine being in a meeting with several people that each have dopey ideas. If no one says anything, nothing happens. But if one brings theirs up, it could either be combined with another dopey idea or tacked on to an existing good idea.</p>



<p>Perhaps the dopey idea sits on the back burner and simmers for years and then suddenly it becomes a brilliant idea because of the market or products changing.</p>



<p>If you work for Apple or any other company, be sure to encourage people to have dopey ideas and voice them. </p>



<p>Steve would want you to.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This program creates an integer counter protected by a mutex, spawns 10 threads, increments the counter 10 times from each thread, and prints the total.</p>
<p>The <code>counter</code> variable lives on the stack, and  a pointer to these stack data is shared with other threads.
The threads have to lock the mutex to do the increments.
When printing the total, the counter is read bypassing the mutex, without any synchronization.</p>
<p>The beauty of this program is that it relies on several bits of subtle reasoning for correctness, each of which is checked by compiler:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Child threads don’t escape the <code>main</code> function and so can read <code>counter</code> from its stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads only access <code>counter</code> through the mutex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child threads will have terminated by the time we read <code>total</code> out of <code>counter</code> without mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>If any of these constraints is broken, the compiler rejects the code.
There’s no need for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> just to defensively make sure that the memory isn’t freed under your feet.</p>
<p>Rust allows doing dangerous, clever, and fast things without fear of introducing undefined behavior.</p>
<p>If you like what you see, here are two books I recommend for diving deeper into Rust:</p>

<h2>Announcing the General Availability of OKD4</h2>
<p>Today, the OKD-WG is pleased to announce the General Availability of OKD4, the community distribution of Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes platform. With today’s GA release of OKD4, Red Hat continues its commitment to open source and open collaboration with the Kubernetes and other Cloud Native communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png" alt="" width="600" srcset="https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=300&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 300w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=600&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 600w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=900&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 900w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1200&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1200w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1500w, https://www.openshift.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png?width=1800&amp;name=OKD4%20is%20now%20Generally%20Available-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<h2>OKD’s Origins</h2>
<p>In April 2012, Red Hat first released Origin as the open source upstream project of OpenShift. We had little inkling of the phenomenal trajectory of cloud-native technology that was to come. From the rise of containers, the birth of OCI and Fedora CoreOS, and now the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/blog/operator-framework-moves-to-cncf-for-incubation" rel=" noopener">CNCF’s incubation of Operator Framework</a>, it has been an amazing ride. OKD4 wouldn’t be possible without all these incredible innovative technologies and their communities.</p>
<p>During the 3.x release timeframe, OKD has been a stable basis for OpenShift Container Platform, acting as an upstream distribution based on community-driven components - CentOS and Project Atomic to name a few. With the advent of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image">Universal Base Image,</a> relations between OKD and OCP has changed - from "upstream-downstream" to what we call "sibling distributions." Images are built using RHEL7 base and can be distributed simultaneously for OKD and OCP, with no rebuild necessary. This enables both distributions to get updated code earlier, including security fixes from RHEL7, and provides a stable base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>OpenShift 4.x heavily focuses on high availability, observability and seamless upgrades. With the OKD 4 release, the community is not only getting easy access to these features, but also the ability to affect the direction of the platform (via <a href="https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/">enhancements process</a>) and a community space for experimentation, discussion and knowledge sharing. The Operators pattern used throughout the design of OKD 4 is allowing users to maintain clusters efficiently over their lifetime.</p>
<h2>Release Highlights</h2>
<p>OKD4 uses <a href="https://youtu.be/JepNm7R0LSo">Fedora CoreOS</a> as a base OS for the nodes. It enables the cluster with recent security fixes, new features (like cgroups v2 support) and updated software. OKD4 is using the same images as the corresponding OpenShift Container Platform release. As a result, the community can participate in the development and can modify any part of the cluster in order to achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>The cluster still has the same features as in OKD3 - it can be installed in the user environment, configured to user liking and updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How it differs from OCP</h2>
<p>Unlike OCP there are several distinctive features in OKD4:</p>
<p>As a community distribution it does not require a pull secret from <a href="https://openshift.com/try">https://openshift.com/try</a>. All OKD4 images are available without additional authentication. The base OS image for OKD4 is available at <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/">https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/</a>. However some optional operators from <a href="https://operatorhub.io/" rel=" noopener">operatorhub.io</a> require a pull secret, so by default OKD4 installs a source with community operators only. See <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-enable-the-non-community-red-hat-operators">FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>OCP is an opinionated Kubernetes distribution with a heavy focus on high availability and production workloads. This puts restrictions on cluster configuration - for instance, single master installations are not supported. OKD4, however, allows users to install single master clusters - for development or stage environments. These clusters cannot be upgraded to later versions, though.</p>
<p>OKD4 creates a new nightly release after OCP tests are completed by our CI system. Every two weeks we'll promote a nightly to a stable release stream, so users can get updates to latest and tested code without switching channels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Installing OKD4 is as easy as OCP4 - see <a href="https://github.com/openshift/okd#getting-started">Getting Started</a> for instructions.</p>

  <p><span>30 Jun 2020</span></p><p>Research has begun to reveal many algorithms can be expressed as matrix multiplication, suggesting an unrealized connection between linear algebra and computer science. I speculate graphs are the missing piece of the puzzle. Graphs are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are suitable data structures for a wide variety of tasks, particularly on modern parallel processing hardware.</p>

<p>In this essay, I explore the virtues of graphs, algebra, types, and show how these concepts can help us reason about programs. I propose a computational primitive based on graph signal processing, linking software engineering, graphs, and linear algebra. Finally, I share my predictions for the path ahead, which I consider to be the start of an exciting new chapter in computing history.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I’ll bet they aren’t laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation. I’ve said some idiotic things to be sure, but I’ve also made some laughable predictions that were correct. Lesson learned: aim straighter.</p>

<p>In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named <a href="https://twitter.com/amirpc">Amir</a> who was singing Hinton’s praises. Hypnotized by his technicolor slides, I quit my job in a hurry and started an educational project using speech recognition and restricted Boltzmann machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about ASR and Android audio. Still love <a href="http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/">that idea</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and <a href="http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/">predicted</a> mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and confirmation bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, this is now driving the world completely insane. Don’t say I warned you, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.</p>

<p>In 2017, I witnessed the birth of <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a>. Had a lot of trouble convincing people that classical programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you’ll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. Don’t thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.</p>

<p>In 2018, I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I’ll bet they tried, but Google’s leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who gave a damn about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving <a href="https://ml4se.github.io/">research area</a> and showing up in <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin">real</a> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/">products</a>, much to the chagrin of those who believed ML was a fad. I suspect their hype filter blinded them to the value those tools provide.</p>

<center>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>— breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

</center>

<p>But to heck with everything I’ve said! If I had just one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Beat that drum as loud as I could. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning. If you want to build provably correct systems that scale on real-world applications, use types. Not everyone is convinced yet, but mark my words, <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345">types</a> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types">coming</a>. Whoever figures out how to connect types and learning will be the next Barbara Liskov or Frances Allen.</p>

<p>This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I’m going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I’m making some big bets and some will be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them.</p>



<p>As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">some bridges</a> in a town divided by rivers, once inhabited by a man called Euler. Was there a tour crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days trying to figure out the answer.</p>

<p>In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">Hamilton</a> who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge">bridge</a>. We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen">thing</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">stones</a>.</p>

<p>In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I picked up a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si">Barabási</a> then at Notre Dame, who had some interesting things to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network">complex networks</a>. Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I <a href="http://breandan.net/images/complex_network_seminar.png">carpooled</a> with a <a href="https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu">nice professor</a>, and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages and many marvelous places.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2017. I was lured by the siren song of algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented <a href="https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia">Myia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/breuleux/buche">Buche</a>. Matt Johnson gave a talk on <a href="https://github.com/HIPS/autograd">Autograd</a>. I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/">differentiable programming</a>. I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf">Master’s thesis</a>.

<p>In 2019, I joined a lab with a <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/">nice professor</a> at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like logical reasoning, knowledge graphs are an idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in the field. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays a big role in software engineering, and it’s the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we’re ever going to untangle this mess we’re in.</p>

<p>This Spring, I took a fascinating seminar on <a href="https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html">Graph Representation Learning</a>. A lot of delightful graph theory has been worked out over the last decade. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> turned into power iteration. People have discovered many interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians, Krylov methods, and spectral graph theory. These ideas have deepened our understanding of graph signal processing and its applications for learning and program analysis. More on that <a href="#graphs-computationally">later</a>.</p>



<p>Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent a variety of data types and procedural phenomena. Unlike most sequential languages, graphs are capable of expressing a much richer family of relations between entities, and are a natural fit for many problems in computer science, physics, biology and mathematics. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing expressive power:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sets</strong>: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets</li>
  <li><strong>Sequences</strong>: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract syntax</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">XML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree">phylogeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">decision trees</a></li>
  <li><strong>DAGs</strong>: <a href="https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">Git</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network">citations</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph">dependency graphs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system">workflows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">control flow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLPs</a></li>

</ul>

<p>As we realized in <a href="https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad">Kotlin∇</a>, directed graphs can be used to model mathematical expressions, as well as other formal languages, including source code, intermediate representations and binary artifacts. Not only can graphs be used to describe extant human knowledge, many recent examples have shown that machines can “grow” trees and graphs for various applications, such as program synthesis, mathematical deduction and physical simulation. Recent neuro-symbolic applications have shown promising early results in graph synthesis:</p>

</ul>

<p>The field of natural language processing has also developed a rich set of graph-based representations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar">constituency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar">dependency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_grammar">link</a> and other and other typed attribute grammars which can be used to reason about syntactic and semantic relations between natural language entities. Research has begun to show many practical applications for such grammars in the extraction and organization of human knowledge stored in large text corpora. Those graphs can be further processed into ontologies for logical reasoning.</p>

<p>Using coreference resolution and entity alignment techniques, we can reconstruct internally consistent relations between entities, which capture cross-corpus consensus in natural language datasets. When stored in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf">knowledge graphs</a>, these relations can be used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other content management systems. Recent techniques have shown promise in automatic knowledge base construction (cf. <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088">Reddy et al.</a>, 2016).</p>

What are you reading today? What have you learnt today that you did not know previously.</p>

<p>In today’s article, its a curation of the articles i’ve read on the second half of June! The articles are classified to the few topics:</p>
<br>
<h2>Topics covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>General Technology and resources for video call</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>General</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Management for tech</li>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/03/lego-blocks-and-organ-transplants/">Organ transplant than lego blocks </a></p>

<p>Software reuseability does not always allow you to copy code wholesale to be placed into another. It requires you to make tweaks and alterations to get it to work as intended in another application. It’s more of an organ transplant than a lego brick. An accurate illustration to share a point! (:</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fly.io/blog/how-cdns-generate-certificates/">How CDNs generate certificate</a></p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fly.io/">fly.io</a>’s article is really interesting. It goes into the mechanics of how certifications are issued, and how does Let’s Encrypt verify your domain belongs to you. That is through the ACME protocol of course. Interstingly, they do provide free tier k8s services at $10/mth equivalent of paid services. Thats super decent. They seek to be competitive with the bigger players such as Google Cloud , Amazon Web Service and Azure.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/team-video/aviary.sh">Aviary.sh</a></p>

<p>If you heard about ansible, it seeks to serve the same role - configuration management. Maybe a good alternative to ansible if it has different dependences that VMs may not have for ansible.</p>

<p>Saw this and its interesting to see hacker news stream in a different format. It would be nice to have a refresh button instead of a manual refresh to get updates.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/">learning regex</a></p>

<p>This website allows you to learn regex with good explanations with exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty. Being an advocate of learn by doing.  I really like how learning has been made easier for people to pick up a skill in bite sizes. No we should not spoon feed people but neither do we give a medium rare steak to a baby. Everything requires a progress and a series of steps to learn the essential skills before proceeding to a higher level competency. Personally, this is a good example of what seems like a lightweight and highly reusable static site for learning a new skill. Definitely a reference for my next pet projects.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/schenkd/nginx-ui">Nginx UI</a></p>

<p>As i was talking about Nginx as a file server, Nginx configuration has always been done via the command line and CLI. This is really amazing to have a UI for you to do your configuration with nice buttons to enable or disable your nginx settings. Really neat and interesting for you to consider on your own project.</p>

<p><a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://mediasoup.org/documentation/overview/">Mediasoup a Selective Forwarding Unit tool for RTC applications</a></p>

<p>If you want to create a webRTC application, there are many architecture to consider. You can read up more about them in my previous post <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.phuaxueyong.com/post/2020-06-15-how-to-make-a-video-chat-app/">here</a>. In order to scale one, you have to consider the Selective Forwarding Unit as the server to transmit your media from your device to your remote peers. One of the beliefs I have is “never reinvent the wheel”. We are in a technology era where many giants have gone before you and already created many tools available for use. So in the case of scalability, it is true that there is no one tool that helps you to address all the technical challenges, but knowing the components of a successful and scalable video call application allows you to then identify the right tools for its respective components.</p>

<p>You have to first identify the screw, in order to realize the need for a screw driver and not a hammer.</p>

<p>Here’s a video talking about mediasoup as well:</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how people across the world are also attempting to solve the same problem, and this time he was able to break down the entire technology stack he used for his video call application. I wonder if it is able to deal with its scalability issue? As well. Below are a TON of articles about video call application that people has so kindly shared with me and now it is my responsibility to delve deeper into this topic and make sense of it.</p>

<p>Chanced upon this simple gadget - a full size 50 keys keyboard with a grey screen that is only about to contain 6 lines of words at any one point. This gadget was created as a way to focus on one thing - typing. For those that are in need for productivity, perhaps such a gadget can help you on that. Beyond productivity, i always wonder if students that are just starting out on their english education could start with such a gadget as well. Simple and straight to the point. It is a keyboard and all you can do is to type and make sense of what is written. But of course, english language goes beyond just stringing words together, that is only the outcome of many other fundamental skills such as grammar and understanding verbs, nouns, pronouns etc.</p>

<p>Mapillary is a geospatial company that strives to create a global street-level imagary dataset to rival Google Street View. Of all company to acquire such as Google, Apple and Microsoft, apparently facebook is the one to acquire them. Facebook actually has been actively involved in the mapping space, contributing over 800,000 kilometers of mappred roads to <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>. It is an opensource crowd funded application that builds a community of mappers that contributes and maintain data about roads, trails, cafes, railway stations and more.</p>

<p>Data is asset. As with all things, once we start to put our own agenda over the rights (privacy rights in this case) of people, thats where the problem starts. Although there are clause to indicate that they may still collect data from you in incognito mode, i guess this violation of rights still stands. In the realm of technology, its all chill and breezy until you start collecting data from users. That’s when you are in for a whole new ball game. Does your entire architecture considered the suite of security measures before your collect your customers first data? Like a ship, you cannot just leave the back portion of the ship unbuilt or complete before you put the ship into waters.</p>

Community support is also crucial for us to exchange experiences and more importantly lessons from one another’s mistakes. This will definitely be something one should put some serious thought if you wish to start your own</p>

<p>Telegram has always been my go to for numerous reasons: speed, ease of use, multi device login, PIN MESSAGE feature, games, platform for bot creation and games. These are just the perks experienced by an end user myself. The security and secret channel provides a nice option for more confidential conversations as well. All powerful tools can be disastrous if it lands onto the hands of scheming ones. So i always wonder how telegram seeks to address issues of users utilizing such a powerful platform for destructive goals. Till today, this question seems to be unanswered.</p>

<p>When we want to grow, more often than not, we choose skirt the challenge before us and find easier alternatives because we feel inadequate. Here’s an example, if you want to learn a language, lets say korean, and somehow you managed to have a job offer that allows you to speak korean, but you choose to turn down that job because you dont feel confident enough in your language yet. So instead, you choose to listen to podcast at home everyday until you feel you are ready. You know what could have helped you to get better in korean? Working at a job in korean.</p>

<p>This is a common tendency as we make crippling decisions if these decisions are directed by fear. Fear has its own way to manipulate us to find alternatives with its fair share of difficulty to substitute the real thing itself. If you want to growth and succeed? There is no other way, but one way: fail forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_29_884">

<div>
<p>Reporting by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-venmo-to-roll-out-crypto-buying-and-selling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk </a>on June 22 speculates that Paypal intends to facilitate the direct buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for its 325 million customer base, through both its Paypal and Venmo services. Paypal is no stranger to crypto, it has been partnered with Coinbase to facilitate fiat withdrawals for US, Candian and European users since 2016. But this move marks a shift of its crypto involvement into the mainstream realm with competing services like Robinhood and Square Cash App already having incorporated Bitcoin purchases on their own platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To contextualise the significance of this, we can look at the closest reference point for crypto generated revenue on a mainstream payment platform – Square.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) revealed on May 6, 2020 that it generated $306 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue during Q1 2020…Square confirmed that volumes increased by 72% quarter-over-quarter and 367% year-over-year”&nbsp; – (Source: </em><a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/05/161145-payments-company-square-generated-306-million-in-bitcoin-btc-revenue-during-q1-2020/#:~:text=Payments%20company%20Square%20(NYSE%3ASQ,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202020.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Crowdfund Insider</em></a><em>)</em></p>



<p>Square has around 24 million monthly active users, less than 10% of Paypal’s 325 million user base and 40 million active monthly users on Venmo. Paypal’s Q1 2020 reporting of $4.1 billion in net revenue is a leading indicator of what it’s crypto integration signals to the market on cryptocurrencies’ growing mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Onboarding crypto for growth: Paypal is building a dam wall&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A move to incorporate cryptocurrency on the platform can be seen as a natural extension of PayPal’s user acquisition and growth strategy on two fronts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Existing cryptocurrency market </strong>– Onboarding fiat funds for the purchase of cryptocurrency continues to be a pain point despite the proliferation of crypto trading platforms. Existing participants and enthusiasts of cryptocurrency could find PayPal to be the easier alternative for onboarding into cryptocurrency trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>New market share for cryptocurrency: </strong>As cryptocurrency grows in consumer mindshare, PayPal could act as the comfortable and trusted first stop for those unfamiliar with the territory.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A globally familiar and trusted payment gateway that is crypto-friendly is perhaps best positioned to channel, contain and manage the oncoming influx of crypto related transaction activity. While others might have been slightly earlier to direct transactions, PayPal will look to leverage its brand dominance to segway as much of this activity into its own dam as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Growing Bitcoin mindshare: Paypal as a trust agent for the masses&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Bitcoin represents a digital currency that is transactable and accepted globally and can be transacted without the need for a trusted third party. Its nature as a trustless currency without borders underpins its narrative as the harbinger of the monetary revolution – a concept inherently tied to its mindshare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s value is a strange phenomenon in and of itself, where users came to a consensus in the absence of the state or platform backed trust elements that traditionally imbue assets or currencies with value. In the place of ‘trust’ the value of Bitcoin initially springboarded off ‘belief’, belief in the ‘work’ that was being done to produce the coins – i.e. the digital mining of the currency. Here the consumption of electricity required for mining represented a cost, and the value of that effort translated into Bitcoin’s value. In its initial stages this cost could be seen as negligible and its value was reflected as such within a small community of enthusiasts who saw a revolution in the monetary system. As this belief propagated, starting from a center of technological enthusiasts and moving outward, mining operations became larger with coordinated efforts and different organisations competing in the space.</p>



<p>The mining input itself didn’t equate to a proportional dollar denominated value, instead the mining represented a ‘unit of belief’ in the system. As the value assigned to this belief grew stronger, eventually drawing in speculators – the unit of belief grew more valuable. As&nbsp; mindshare for Bitcoin grew so too did its value, and in line with the whims of belief the price will continue to fluctuate gaining more stability only as the belief becomes more anchored.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Belief driven adoption: The ripples of a grassroots technology&nbsp;</h3>



<p>We can think about belief adoption as a series of concentric circles:</p>



<ul><li>Core circle : technology enthusiasts – belief in the potential of Bitcoin</li><li>2nd circle: technically inclined –&nbsp; belief in the technical narrative and agreeing that there is value in such technology</li><li>3rd circle – speculators – belief that Bitcoin holds value as a result of the previous two circles</li><li>4th circle – lay audience – whose trust is transferred from existing trust agents / institutions etc.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Knowing that the core to the 3rd circle has already been flushed with belief and crypto is primed to be adopted by a more lay audience, PayPal is well positioned to feed into the 4th layer. The trust built up over two decades across consumers and merchants can’t be overstated, especially in its ability to catalyse lay belief and participation for crypto on behalf of its 325 million users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We increasingly see the 4th layer’s belief adoption being accelerated by both direct and more peripheral signaling. While PayPal,Robinhood, Square etc. are definitely more on the nose, the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Libra (Facebook’s stable currency) and bank/ state backed digital currencies are indirect feedback loops to the belief in the adoption of Bitcoin. Where it may not lead to the direct use of Bitcoin, it does bring people up the curve of trusting, understanding and utilising digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of whether one believes that Bitcoin is a currency or not, the belief adoption cycles have given intrinsic value to Bitcoin as an asset – value that can’t be overlooked. Each layer of belief adoption was accompanied by its own miniature boom and bust cycles bringing us to today. Bitcoin still stands out as a phenomenon, where its value is entirely tied up in its belief adoption structure. Competing digital currencies from trust entities (Facebook as an example) or states still function on the idea of borders (digital or otherwise) and are intrinsically collateralised by the trust and assets of the backing entity – not quite the revolution Bitcoin represents.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Social scalability – trust minimisation in a hyper connected world</h3>



<p>Social scalability: Bitcoin’s inefficiency in computation and scalability is not a flaw but a feature.</p>



<p>“The secret to Bitcoin’s success is certainly not its computational efficiency or its scalability in the consumption of resources.&nbsp; Specialized Bitcoin hardware is designed by highly paid experts to perform only one particular function – to repetitively solve a very specific and intentionally very expensive kind of computational puzzle. That puzzle is called a proof-of-work, because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computer did a costly computation.”</p>



<p>“…Bitcoin’s success is that its prolific resource consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution –- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants’ behaviors — to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow.&nbsp; It’s about human limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource constraints…”</p>



<p>Social scalability is measured by the ability of participants to coordinate efficiently for the continued extraction of value even as the network scales. As networks grow, there is a requirement for increasing the level of trust. But with this increase, comes the added cognitive burden for individuals on the potential harms in the network, thus decreasing efficiency. This is especially true of our hyper connected world, where we are required to place trust in many intermediaries to gain benefit from the network. Trust minimisation then becomes an important factor in achieving greater levels of social scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way to estimate the social scalability of an institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its benefits.”</p>



<p>“Satoshi’s breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.”</p>



<p>In order to address the stunting of social scalability in an increasingly hyper connected world, starting from base principles, even with the trade off of efficiency, is an effective method. Traction may be much slower, but from its humble beginnings it could provide humanity with a model for social scalability that would otherwise have been unavailable. The belief that this form of social scalability holds value is demonstrated by the game theory mechanics of the energy expended to secure the network, compared to the value attributed to a Bitcoin by …</p></div></div></div>

No one’s hiding it.</span>” – Sam Ritchie</p><p>“I’m aiming to implement these interfaces and pass these tests and then being able to immediately turn around and have like an approximate sliding window counter that would just work with stripes … entire machine learning feature generation interface.” – Sam Ritchie</p><h3><strong>Transcript</strong></h3><p><strong>This is a machine-translated transcript. Podcast page for <a href="https://corecursive.com/050-sam-ritchie-portal-abstractions-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this episode is here</a></strong></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>Several years ago, Twitter had this problem that may sound familiar. The problem is big data versus fast data or batch processing versus real-time string processing. Probably because of the scale that they operate at and the realtime nature of the Twitter feed t</span><span>hey hit this problem earlier than the rest of us. </span></p><p><span>Batch is very efficient. You can calculate things on years of data, but doing the calculation might take a day. Real-time is much faster, but you can sort of only work forward in time. Really, you need both these things. If I want to look at my most liked tweet, I need to look at all the old batch data, but also any real-time tweets that I’m doing&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So it’s 2013 Sam Ritchie is a mechanical engineer by training is uncle is Dennis Richie, and he’s working at Twitter, and his job is just translating from one system to the other from real-time to a batch job.</span></p><p><b>Sam:</b><span> And there’s just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You just said enough is enough. Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in a real-time world and also in batch world.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>I guess I’ve come up with the problem from that side where it’s like, “oh, I can calculate this thing, but I just started calculating it and like, the world existed before.”</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b>Y<span>eah, the backfill problem’s hard and it’s hard. Like it just consumes your life writing, you know, backfill jobs and you kinda, you, you stick to really simple things because you know, you’re gonna have to write them twice. You’re going to have to maintain them twice.&nbsp;</span><span>I mean, it’s really not a nice way to live.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Backstory</b></h2><p><b>Adam:</b><span> Hello and welcome to co recursive. I’m Adam Gordon bell. How did Sam get away from these one-off jobs? How did they solve this fast versus big data issue? An issue many are still struggling with, the answer isn’t some new data processing system that he’s here to show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, the answer is actually abstract Algebra and probabilistic data structures.&nbsp; If you don’t know what those are, don’t worry. We’re going to walk through it. We’re also going to talk about what Sam calls portal abstractions. That’s finding abstractions that let you leverage work from other fields, But we’ll do that at the ending. </span><span>Let’s start at the beginning. When Sam was working away at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>I was on the revenue team.&nbsp; I had a colleague named Oscar Boykin who I didn’t know that well. We both maintained one of these like libraries I mentioned before that lived on top of a dupe. He had the scala version. I had this closure version and I’m kind of yet again, I had a task for work that was like building one of these dashboards.</span></p><p><span>You’re trying to count something like, you know, tweets per user per day. You’re just basically grouping on some key and then adding numbers to a database. And there are just so many jobs that looked like that, and it kind of looked like that was going to be my life, like just coding these things.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Through, you know, this or that, Oscar and I teamed up to work on some shared piece of machinery for serialization between the code we both maintained and we realized that like we both were doing this sort of thing and he’s got a lower tolerance for BS. You just said enough is enough.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Like we need to figure out how to write one piece of code that will run in the real-time world and also in the batch world.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like this is, this happens with compilers, like this is a compiler problem. Let’s just back off and solve it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>So they solve it. They built version one of this open-source analytics system could do a batch, it could do real-time. Some of the results together. They called it a Summingbird. It sums things, and it’s from Twitter, so it’s a bird. But then they had some interesting revelations about what they had created.</span></p><h2><b>Stitching Things Together</b></h2><p><b>Sam:</b><span> You know, if you really simplify what we’re dealing with here,&nbsp; you’re writing code that is generating for some key, tweets per user, per hour, something that happens. It might just tweet per user, it might be how many users we have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then you have some value, you have some counter that you’re ticking, so you’re just incrementing this thing up. And so many machines learning features and dashboards and everything is just like ticking counters. It’s kind of like and that’s like the secret of analytics work is you’re just adding ones. That seems suspicious too. Like that’s something you could maybe break out of like a really, is that all we can do? Like how would you do more complicated things? But so this, this software package, Summingbird was a library that lets you write a logical declaration of what you wanted to happen. And then, the second component of it would take, that data structure that you’ve built and go run it on any number of these different, underlying platforms.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>The God of Counting</b></h2><p><span><strong>Sam:&nbsp;</strong> So I can power a dashboard. I can do backfills. I have this boundary that’s maintained transparently to me, that behind the scenes we’ll give a hard line between the, you know, massive, multi-year database. And then the last couple of hours that are stored in some much harder to manage, much more fragile, but very, very fast, you know, online processing system.</span></p><p><span>And you know, phase one was just write something that can do, you know logically you’re doing the same thing. You’ve been rewriting the same code. Just have the machine write it for you. but it does open this door and this is the topic I wanted to get to.</span></p><p><span>It opens the door and you start to look at this thing and think you know, you have these two buckets. One is like all, all-time before a couple of hours ago, and then you have a bucket for each of the recent hours. So you’re doing this addition of some of the numbers, Uh, but you’re sort of putting parentheses in one case around like years and years of data, and then another set of parentheses around like each of the previous few hours, and then you take this final step of adding them together.</span></p><p><b>Adam:</b><span> If you’re calculating how many times I’ve tweeted, like Hadoop gets like everything up to yesterday, and then I’m adding that to something that’s actually getting the real-time data and just</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>That’s right.</span></p><h2><b>Abstract Algebra</b></h2><p><b>Sam: </b><span>&nbsp;Those are nice ideas, but they’re not that they’re sort of obvious and not that powerful. But this idea of adding things and putting parentheses wherever you want, It also seems kind of innocuous. It’s like this little lamp you pick up, right? It looks kind of, you know, you rub the lamp, you and what you find is like, this idea is not, it’s not your new idea.</span></p><p><span>It’s very simple, but it actually exists in this field of abstract algebra.</span></p><p><b>Adam: </b><span>Alright. Abstract algebra, if you’re not familiar with it, it’s a subfield of math. Stick with me here. I’ll explain it a little bit. A lot of concepts from abstract algebra can be implemented in a programming language. A semigroup is one of these. It’s an interface. It has one method. That method is add or sum. If we want to stick with the summingbird pun. It also has a rule that things have to be associative. You might remember associativity from a high school math class.</span></p><p><span>What happened here is Sam had the system where to calculate analytics. The calculation had to implement a certain interface and then the system could run it in both worlds. The interface had an add method, which meant it was a semigroup, which meant this subfield of math with people talking about seemingly obscure constructs could suddenly enable him to answer interesting questions in his real-time analytics dashboard thing at Twitter.</span></p><p><b>Sam: </b><span>So yeah, you can start slimming things back, and when you slimmed it back almost to nothing, you’re left with this object called a semigroup, which is an idea of: okay I need some set of things. So numbers in what we’ve been doing, which is just counting, some way to quote, add two of them together and get something out that’s like still the same type and then a test that goes along with that. So the test is that I have to be able to do that associatively.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So this is kind of, it sort of sounds like a pedantic Mathy thing. Like there’s this impulse that I’m sure we can get into in the functional programming world to like, like see ideas that seemed mathy and like slap math names on them and just tweet about it and to like spraying that and that, that sucks.</span></p><p><span>But I think it’s, the, the thing you get when you do that when you identify …</span></p></div></div>
