<p>This is my 50th post published on this blog. To celebrate, I’ll go all meta and describe the ins and outs of my <em>“blogger’s career”</em>. Read on if you ever wanted to start writing but never got around to actually hitting the publish button. This post aims to encourage you that blogging can be loads of fun and open up a whole range of opportunities for your career.</p>
<h3 id="your-best-online-portfolio">Your best online portfolio</h3>
<p>I’ve started blogging when I failed to score the <em>“dream”</em> job. I’ve decided to increase my future chances by appearing more professional as an author of a technical blog. My first posts were answers to questions that kept popping up during interviews.</p>
<p>I know that some companies, e.g., software houses, forbid their employees to share details about clients that they’ve worked for. It means that after spending a couple of years in the software house, you could have not much to show to score a better job. A collection of technical blog posts could be your ticket to a more senior/lead/principal position.</p>
<h3 id="the-value-of-being-wrong-on-the-internet">The value of being wrong on the internet</h3>
<p>Working on a blog post allows you to investigate different technical topics deeper than you would otherwise. There’s no better way to learn something than to try to explain it to random strangers from the internet. I often setup throwaway projects, submit open-source PRs, and read up on eBooks when doing the research for my posts.</p>
<p>I send most of my posts for proofreading to friends before publication. They usually catch most of the errors, but it’s not a tragedy even if they don’t.</p>
<p>If you publish a technical post and someone points out your error, you’ve just learned something new. I regularly improve my posts based on comments from social platforms. For me, especially <a href="https://reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://lobste.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lobsters</a> are a great source of valuable comments. By publishing online, you can easily trigger internet experts to share their wisdom with you.</p>
<h3 id="build-it-on-your-own-ground">Build it on your own ground</h3>
<p>I think it’s critical to publish your content on the platform that you own. For the first one or two posts, you could use something like Medium. Once you decide you enjoy the process of blogging, then migrating to your custom domain and server is the only reasonable choice.</p>
<p>I’d recommend registering a domain that’s somewhat related to your real name. Fancy brands and pseudonyms come and go, and we’re talking a long game here.</p>
<p>Just please, please don’t stay on Medium! It’s terrible for your personal brand and SEO. Regularly publishing there is a wasted effort. Check out <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/medium-blogging-platform-seo">this blog post</a> for more info about why.</p>
<p>There are many cases of arbitrary censorship on social media nowadays. If you publish on a platform that you don’t control, you risk losing the results of your hard work for whatever strange reason. It’s significantly less probable to lose your domain, but you still could get banned by Google and lose all organic traffic.</p>
<p>The only resource that no IT giant could take away from you is a mailing list. Unfortunately, I’m not an expert on building one. I’ve only managed to gather a couple of hundred subscribers in over three years.</p>
<h3 id="jump-start-any-new-project">Jump-start any new project</h3>
<p>I quit my full-time job half a year ago. I’ve since been paying my bills from the sponsorship of this blog and profit from <a href="https://abot.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abot for Slack</a>. Having those two sources of base <em>“passive”</em> income allowed me to take a step towards working as a consultant instead of a developer. Check out this <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/hbin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent book by Jonathan Start</a> for more info about the difference between the two.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that if it wasn’t for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16616991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>viralish</em> blog post</a> my Slack bot would have never taken off. Based on the comments it received, I’ve refined the app’s features and business model to a much more profitable format.</p>
<p>Currently, the primary commercial purpose of this blog is to serve as a content-marketing platform to advertise my <a href="https://pawelurbanek.com/#rails-performance-tuning">Rails performance and security audits</a>. It has been slowly picking up speed, and if this keeps up, I might not have to come back to working 9 to 5 anytime soon. Currently, my Rails audit adverts on this blog receive clicks every single day. I’d have to spend significant $$$ on Google Ads to generate similar paid traffic.</p>
<p>This domain also allows me to keep the SEO gods happy by backlinking to my other projects and passing some of its authority.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that a domain getting steady organic visitors is an invaluable resource. It allows you to pour traffic towards any future project that you might come up with. When you start writing, you won’t know the ultimate purpose of your blog. The possibilities are kind of endless.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Gradually growing your own place on the internet could be the single best investment in your future career. Just do it a single step at a time. When I published my first post three years ago, I never thought blogging would become a significant part of my everyday work and income. Or that I’d ever reach 50th blog post and keep going.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The notion of programming paradigms, with associated programming languages and methodologies, is a well established tenet of Computer Science pedagogy, enshrined in international curricula. However,this notion sits ill with Kuhn’s classic conceptualisation of a scientific paradigm as a dominant world view, which supersedes its predecessors through superior explanatory power.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is not at all clear how programming paradigms are to be characterised and differentiated. Indeed, on closer inspection, apparently disparate programming paradigms are very strongly connected. Rather, they should be viewed as different traditions of a unitary Computer Science paradigm of Turing complete computation complemented by Computational Thinking.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Compilation time is an important factor in the adaptability of a software project. Fast recompilation enables cheap experimentation with changes to a project, as those changes can be tested quickly. Separate and incremental compilation has been a topic of interest for a long time to facilitate fast recompilation.</p>

<p>Inquiry: Despite the benefits of an incremental compiler, such compilers are usually not the default. This is because incrementalization requires cross-cutting, complicated, and error-prone techniques such as dependency tracking, caching, cache invalidation, and change detection. Especially in compilers for languages with cross-module definitions and integration, correctly and efficiently implementing an incremental compiler can be a challenge. Retrofitting incrementality into a compiler is even harder. We address this problem by developing a compiler design approach that reuses parts of an existing non-incremental compiler to lower the cost of building an incremental compiler. It also gives an intuition into compiling difficult-to-incrementalize language features through staging.</p>

<p>Approach: We use the compiler design approach presented in this paper to develop an incremental com- piler for the Stratego term-rewriting language. This language has a set of features that at first glance look incompatible with incremental compilation. Therefore, we treat Stratego as our critical case to demonstrate the approach on. We show how this approach decomposes the original compiler and has a solution to com- pile Stratego incrementally. The key idea on which we build our incremental compiler is to internally use an incremental build system to wire together the components we extract from the original compiler.</p>

<p>Knowledge: The resulting compiler is already in use as a replacement of the original whole-program compiler. We find that the incremental build system inside the compiler is a crucial component of our approach. This allows a compiler writer to think in multiple steps of compilation, and combine that into a incremental compiler almost effortlessly. Normally, separate compilation à la C is facilitated by an external build system, where the programmer is responsible for managing dependencies between files. We reuse an existing sound and optimal incremental build system, and integrate its dependency tracking into the compiler.</p>

<p>Grounding: The incremental compiler for Stratego is available as an artefact along with this article. We evaluate it on a large Stratego project to test its performance. The benchmark replays edits to the Stratego project from version control. These benchmarks are part of the artefact, packaged as a virtual machine image for easy reproducibility.</p>

<p>Importance: Although we demonstrate our design approach on the Stratego programming language, we also describe it generally throughout this paper. Many currently used programming languages have a compiler that is much slower than necessary. Our design provides an approach to change this, by reusing an existing compiler and making it incremental within a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>Welcome back guys, in this module, we are going to discuss the Future of Python, i.e., how python is booming todayâ€™s industry, and how the same or more industries can be impacted by python. So, letâ€™s dive into the depth of this amazing module.</p>
<h2>Future of Python</h2>
<p>Since Python has become the most used modern programming language in todayâ€™s arena. It has been dominated in all other programming languages like <a href="https://usemynotes.com/c-programming/">C</a>, C++, <a href="https://usemynotes.com/java-programming/">Java</a>, and many more. Since, the day it comes into role i.e., the early nineties, from that very day till now, it has made its growth continuously. So, what is making python more popular, is it going to be in the same trend in the future also.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s focus on some of the key points about the popularity of python.</p>
<h3>Beginners Friendly</h3>
<p>Python is a very easy language; it can easily be chosen as the first language by each and every person who wants to land in the programming world.</p>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>The most important part of python is that it is open-source, i.e., freely available on the internet and anyone from anywhere in the world can use that code and make changes or modify that accordingly as per the requirement.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>Python is a very versatile language, i.e., in almost everything we can work with python, developers, and making or developing many packages for everything, like it is mostly used in data science, web development, and many more. Some of the frequently used libraries are NumPy for working with numerical i.e., numbers, pandas for working with data sets, scikit-learn for working with various machine learning algorithms.</p>
<h3>Cross-Platform language</h3>
<p>The best part of python is that it can be easily used with any type of operating system whether it be Windows, Linux or Mac, etc. This means that you donâ€™t have to use different code for working with the different operating system, the code written in windows can be used in the Linux platforms also. In simple words, python doesnâ€™t need the support of our system.</p>
<h3>Speed and Productivity</h3>
<p>The ability of python, the way it controls the process, the integration of various processes, its various framework, these all things or we can say all these capabilities of python lead to increase its speed and productivity. Multi-protocol network applications, most applications can be built by using python.</p>
<h3>Pseudocode</h3>

<p>It is a very simple language, which comes with very advanced features that can easily overcome all the common programming tasks.</p>
<h3>Strong and rich community</h3>
<p>There are many programmers who are working in python only and coming up with various solutions for a variety of problems and this creates a strong community of smart developers.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of Python?</h2>
<p>Since, we know why <a href="https://usemynotes.com/python/">python</a> is popular, so in the same way because of its popularity and features it is giving an advantage to a lot of companies using python, Letâ€™s see some of the benefits of using python.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Website Building</h3>
<p>Python can be used for creating websites as per your requirement very easily.</p>
<h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
<p>Many Apps are being created with the help of python only nowadays and are deployed in the play store.</p>
<h3>GUI-based Application</h3>
<p>Many responsive GUI applications are created with the help of python by using the <strong>Tkinter library.</strong></p>
<h3>Data Science</h3>
<p>The most important field in which python is booming the developers and creating a lot of competition in the market. Python is widely used for data analysis, data visualization, data exploration. As we know, there is a huge amount of data is generated every single day by almost all the companies, and so to handle that data, python is used.</p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Python is used to build a Machine Learning model, which is used for making predictions. Healthcare, e-commerce, tech companies, almost all sectors are using the machine learning technique.</p>
<p>So, these are some of the benefits of python that why python is widely used, this is what python is in the current scenario, and also because of its amazing features and characteristics, it will continue to boom in the future also.</p>
<p>There are many programming languages, and python is on top of all that, it is usually the favorite language of all the programmers among all other available languages. Python is developing at a huge rate and is able to develop many of the applications which have been used in real-time, and the most important thing is <strong>Machine learning</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong> and taking up the IT sector and working with these, python is used.

            Everyone Is Beautiful and No One Is Horny    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Modern action and superhero films fetishize the body, even as they desexualize it.</strong></h4>



<p><strong>by RS Benedict</strong></p>



<p>When Paul Verhoeven adapted <em>Starship Troopers</em> in the late 1990s, did he know he was predicting the future? The endless desert war, the ubiquity of military propaganda, a cheerful face shouting victory as more and more bodies pile up?</p>



<p>But the scene that left perhaps the greatest impact on the minds of Nineties kids—and the scene that anticipated our current cinematic age the best—does not feature bugs or guns. It is, of course, the shower scene, in which our heroic servicemen and -women enjoy a communal grooming ritual.</p>



<p>On the surface, it is idyllic: racial harmony, gender equality, unity behind a common goal—and firm, perky asses and tits.</p>



<p>And then the characters speak. The topic of conversation? Military service, of course. One joined for the sake of her political career. Another joined in the hopes of receiving her breeding license. Another talks about how badly he wants to kill the enemy. No one looks at each other. No one flirts.</p>



<p>A room full of beautiful, bare bodies, and everyone is only horny for war.</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, there was a brief period where actresses pretended that their thinness was natural, almost accidental. Skinny celebrities confessed their love of burgers and fries in magazines; models undergoing profile interviews engaged in public consumption of pasta; leading ladies joked about how little they exercised and how much they hated it. It was all bullshit: no one looks like that without calorie restriction. We knew it then, and we know it now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t pretend anymore. The promotional cycles for blockbuster movies now include detailed descriptions of the performers’ fitness regimens. We watch actors doing burpees or shaking ropes with expensive personal trainers. There is some talk of diets, though not terribly detailed—and no mention of steroids or other hormonal supplements, even though male actors’ suddenly ultra-swole selfies on Instagram suggest physiques crafted with chemical assistance.</p>



<p>Actors are more physically perfect than ever: impossibly lean, shockingly muscular, with magnificently coiffed hair, high cheekbones, impeccable surgical enhancements, and flawless skin, all displayed in form-fitting superhero costumes with the obligatory shirtless scene thrown in to show off shredded abs and rippling pecs.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Even background extras are good-looking, or at least inoffensively bland. No one is ugly. No one is really fat. Everyone is beautiful.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And this isn’t just the lead and the love interest: supporting characters look this way too, and even villains (frequently clad in monstrous makeup) are still played by conventionally attractive performers. Even background extras are good-looking, or at least inoffensively bland. No one is ugly. No one is really fat. Everyone is beautiful.</p>



<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/marvel-movies-this-esteemed-director-says-theyre-not-sexy-enough.html/"><strong>no one is horny</strong></a>. Even when they have sex, no one is horny. No one is attracted to anyone else. No one is hungry for anyone else.</p>



<p>When revisiting a beloved Eighties or Nineties film, Millennial and Gen X viewers are often startled to encounter long-forgotten sexual content content: John Connor’s conception in <em>Terminator</em>, Jamie Lee Curtis’s toplessness in <em>Trading Places</em>, the spectral blowjob in <em>Ghostbusters</em>. These scenes didn’t shock us when we first saw them. Of <em>course </em>there’s sex in a movie. Isn’t there always?</p>



<p>The answer, of course, is not anymore—at least not when it comes to modern blockbusters</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="319" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-300x188.jpg 300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/qicstnq7qznw0tipo9fa.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px"></figure></div>



<p>We’re told that Tony Stark and Pepper Potts are an item, but no actual romantic or sexual chemistry between them is shown in the films. Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor utterly lack the sexual chemistry to convince us that either of them would be thirsty enough to commandeer a coma victim’s body (as they do in <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>) so they can enjoy a posthumous hookup. In defiance of Norse mythology, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor<em> </em>smiles at Natalie Portman like a dumb golden retriever puppy without ever venturing to rend her asunder with his mighty hammer, so to speak. Not that the competition is any better. Despite accusations of being an incel icon, it is Heath Ledger’s Joker, not Christian Bale’s chaste and sexless Batman, who exudes the most sexual energy in the Dark Knight trilogy.</p>



<p>And speaking of Christopher Nolan’s inexplicably sexless oeuvre—did anyone else think it odd how <em>Inception </em>enters the deepest level of a rich man’s subconscious and finds <em>not </em>a psychosexual Oedipal nightmare of staggering depravity, but… a ski patrol?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Let’s not pretend that Old Hollywood was a progressive haven of body positivity. Since the departure of voluptuous vamp Theda Bara from the silver screen, actors have always gone to extremes to maintain a certain look. Rita Hayworth underwent an ethnic makeover to appear more Caucasian so she could get leading roles. Stars of the 1920s limited their fluid consumption to two glasses a day to avoid water weight. Jane Fonda suffered from severe bulimia at the height of her sex symbol status; so did Marlon Brando.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Snake Plissken didn’t fuck on screen, but the character radiates overwhelming sex-haver energy.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But old films still featured recognizable human bodies and human faces—bodies that could theoretically be achieved by a single person without the aid of a team of personal trainers, dieticians, private chefs, and chemists.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="252" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2-1300x650.jpg 1300w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/actors-featured-2.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px"></figure></div>



<p>In the films of the Eighties and Nineties, leading actors were good looking, yes, but still human. Kurt Russel’s Snake Plissken was a hunk, but in shirtless scenes his abs have no definition. Bruce Willis was handsome, but he’s more muscular now than he was in the Nineties, when he was routinely branded a bona fide sex symbol. And when Isabella Rosselini strips in <em>Blue Velvet</em>, her skin is pale and her body is soft. She looks vulnerable and real.</p>



<p>And yet, these characters fucked. <em>Blue Velvet’s </em>Dorothy Vallens and Jeffrey Beaumant fucked. Michael Keaton’s Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer’s domme Catwoman fucked. Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fucked. Snake Plissken didn’t fuck on screen, but the character radiates overwhelming sex-haver energy. And I defy you to find a mainstream film with a moment as horny and gay as the <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-true-story-of-the-lost-boys-sax-man-1842774832"><strong>Sexy Saxophone Solo</strong></a> from <em>The Lost Boys</em>.</p>

<p>Seen today, one of the most striking scenes in 1982’s Poltergeist is not the evil clown doll or the monster tree, but a moment of relaxed affection between the parents. The father—a bald, beer-bellied Craig T. Nelson—cracks jokes and prances for his wife, who wears a frumpy nightgown and smokes a joint and yammers weed thoughts and laughs at her husband’s silly display. Finally, the husband playfully dives onto the bed. Neither character is glamorous in this scene, but their relationship feels frisky and lived-in and charismatic and <em>real</em>.</p>



<p>The house looks real, too. There are toys and magazines scattered around the floor. There are cardboard boxes waiting to be unpacked since the recent move. Framed pictures rest against the wall; the parents haven’t gotten around to mounting them yet. The kitchen counters are cluttered and mealtimes are rambunctious and sloppy, as one expects in a house with three children. They’re building a pool in the backyard, but not for appearances: it’s a place for the kids to swim, for the parents to throw parties, and for the father to reacquaint himself with his love of diving.</p>



<p>At the time, this house represented an aspirational ideal of American affluence.</p>



<p>Compare this to homes in films now: massive, sterile cavernous spaces with minimalist furniture. Kitchens are industrial-sized and spotless, and they contain no food. There is no excess. There is no mess.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>A body is no longer a holistic system. It is not the vehicle through which we experience joy and pleasure. It is not a home to live in and be happy.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In her blog McMansion Hell, Kate Wagner examines precisely why these widely-hated 5000-square foot housing bubble behemoths are so awful. Over and over again, she reiterates the point that McMansions are not built to be homes; they’re built to be short-term investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mcmansionhell.com/post/150597521816/mcmansions-101-revisited-aesthetics-aside-why"><strong>Kate writes</strong></a>, “The inside of McMansions are designed in order to cram the most ‘features’ inside for the lowest costs.” These features exist to increase the house’s resale value, not to make it a good place to live. No thought is given to the labor needed to clean and maintain these spaces. The master bathroom includes intricate stone surfaces that can only be scrubbed with a toothbrush; the cathedral ceilings in the living room raise the heating and cooling costs to an exorbitant sum; the chandelier in the grand entryway dangles so high that no one can replace the bulbs in it, even with a stepladder.</p>



<p>The same fate has befallen our bodies. A body is no longer a holistic system. It is not the vehicle through which we experience joy and pleasure during our brief time in the land of the living. It is not a home to live in and be happy. It, too, is a collection of features: six pack, thigh gap, cum gutters. And these features exist not to make our lives more comfortable, but to increase the value of our assets. Our bodies are investments, which must always be optimized to bring us… what, exactly? Some vague sense of better living? Is a life without bread objectively better than a life with it? When we were children, did we dream of counting every calorie and logging every step?</p>



<p>A generation or two ago, it was normal for adults to engage in sports not purely as self-improvement but as an act of leisure. People danced for fun; couples socialized over tennis; kids played stickball for lack of anything else to do. Solitary exercise at the gym also had a social, rather than moral, purpose. People worked out to look hot so they could attract other hot people and fuck them. Whatever the ethos …</p></div></div>
