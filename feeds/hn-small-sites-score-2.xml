<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.</p><p>As software engineers our job is not to produce code per se, but rather to solve problems. Unstructured text, like in the form of a design doc, may be the better tool for solving problems early in a project lifecycle, as it may be more concise and easier to comprehend, and communicates the problems and solutions at a higher level than code.</p><p>Besides the original documentation of a software design, design docs fulfill the following functions in the software development lifecycle:</p><ul><li><p>Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.</p></li><li><p>Achieving consensus around a design in the organization.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns.</p></li><li><p>Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization.</p></li><li><p>Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.</p></li><li><p>Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).</p></li></ul><h2 id="anatomy-of-a-design-doc">Anatomy of a design doc <a href="#anatomy-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h2><p>Design docs are informal documents and thus don’t follow a strict guideline for their content. Rule #1 is: Write them in whatever form makes the most sense for the particular project.</p><p>Having said that, a certain structure has established itself as really useful.</p><h3 id="context-and-scope">Context and scope <a href="#context-and-scope">#</a></h3><p>This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which the new system is being built and what is actually being built. This isn’t a requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is that readers are brought up to speed but some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.</p><h3 id="goals-and-non-goals">Goals and non-goals <a href="#goals-and-non-goals">#</a></h3><p>A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals aren’t negated goals like “The system shouldn’t crash”, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be “ACID compliance”; when designing a database, you’d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesn’t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.</p><h3 id="the-actual-design">The actual design <a href="#the-actual-design">#</a></h3><p>This section should start with an overview and then go into details.</p><p><img alt="Visualization of how to draw an owl. First picture: two circles labeled &quot;1. Draw some circles&quot;. Second picture: Picture of an own labeled &quot;2. Draw the rest of the fucking owl&quot;" height="488" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv.jpg" width="600" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZCBwPv-320w.jpg 320w"></p><p>The design doc is <em>the place to write down the trade-offs</em> you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.</p><p>The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem set at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance for how to actually describe the design.</p><p>Having said that, a few best practices and repeating topics have emerged that make sense for a large percentage of design docs:</p><h4 id="system-context-diagram"><strong>System-context-diagram</strong> <a href="#system-context-diagram">#</a></h4><p>In many docs a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_context_diagram">system-context-diagram</a></em> can be very useful. Such a diagram shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already familiar with.</p><p><img alt="Block diagram showing how various systems are related to each other. The actual text is just examples and not needed to be seen to understand the example." height="333" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N.png" width="655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/2mPr0N-320w.jpg 320w"><br><em>Example of a system-context-diagram.</em></p><h4 id="apis">APIs <a href="#apis">#</a></h4><p>If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="data-storage">Data storage <a href="#data-storage">#</a></h4><p>Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.</p><h4 id="code-and-pseudo-code">Code and pseudo-code <a href="#code-and-pseudo-code">#</a></h4><p>Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the implementability of the design.</p><h4 id="degree-of-constraint">Degree of constraint <a href="#degree-of-constraint">#</a></h4><p>One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.</p><p>On one end of the extreme is the “greenfield software project”, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.</p><p>On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn’t at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn’t designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.</p><p>In this situation you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are really great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.</p><h3 id="alternatives-considered">Alternatives considered <a href="#alternatives-considered">#</a></h3><p>This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.</p><p>While it is fine to be succinct about solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.</p><h3 id="cross-cutting-concerns">Cross-cutting concerns <a href="#cross-cutting-concerns">#</a></h3><p>This is where your organization can ensure that certain cross-cutting concerns such as security, privacy, and observability are always taken into consideration. These are often relatively short sections that explain how the design impacts the concern and how the concern is addressed. Teams should standardize what these concerns are in their case.</p><p>Due to their importance, Google projects are required to have a dedicated privacy design doc, and there are dedicated reviews for privacy and security. While the reviews are only required to be completed by the time a project launches, it is best practice to engage with privacy and security teams as early as possible to ensure that designs take them into account from the ground up. In case of dedicated docs for these topics, the central design doc can, of course, reference them instead of going into detail.</p><h3 id="the-length-of-a-design-doc">The length of a design doc <a href="#the-length-of-a-design-doc">#</a></h3><p>Design docs should be sufficiently detailed but short enough to actually be read by busy people. The sweet spot for a larger project seems to be around 10-20ish pages. If you get way beyond that, it might make sense to split up the problem into more manageable sub problems. It should also be noted that it is absolutely possible to write a 1-3 page “mini design doc”. This is especially helpful for incremental improvements or sub tasks in an agile project–you still do all the same steps as for a longer doc, just keep things more terse and focused on a limited problem set.</p><h2 id="when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">When <em>not</em> to write a design doc. <a href="#when-not-to-write-a-design-doc.">#</a></h2><p>Writing design docs is overhead. The decision whether to write a design doc comes down to the core trade-off of deciding whether the benefits in organizational consensus around design, documentation, senior review, etc. outweigh the extra work of creating the doc. At the center of that decision lies whether the solution to the design problem is ambiguous–because of problem complexity or solution complexity, or both. If it is not, then there is little value in going through the process of writing a doc.</p><p>A clear indicator that a doc might not be necessary are design docs that are really <em>implementation manuals</em>. If a doc basically says “This is how we are going to implement it” without going into trade-offs, alternatives, and explaining decision making (or if the solution is so obvious as to mean there were no trade-offs), then it would probably have been a better idea to write the actual program right away.</p><p>Finally, the overhead of creating and reviewing a design doc may not be compatible with prototyping and rapid iteration. However, most software projects do have a set of <em>actually known problems</em>. Subscribing to agile methodologies is not an excuse for not taking the time to get solutions to actually known problems right. Additionally, prototyping itself may be part of the design doc creation. “I tried it out and it works” is one of the best arguments for choosing a design.</p><h2 id="the-design-doc-lifecycle">The design doc lifecycle <a href="#the-design-doc-lifecycle">#</a></h2><p>The steps in the lifecycle of a design document are:</p><ol><li>Creation and rapid iteration</li><li>Review (may be in multiple rounds)</li><li>Implementation and iteration</li><li>Maintenance and learning</li></ol><h3 id="creation-and-rapid-iteration">Creation and rapid iteration <a href="#creation-and-rapid-iteration">#</a></h3><p>You write the doc. Sometimes together with a set of co-authors.</p><p>This phase quickly evolves into a time of rapid iteration where the doc is shared with colleagues who have the most knowledge about the problem space (often belonging to the same team) and through their clarifying questions and suggestions drive the doc to a first relatively stable version.</p><p>While you certainly find engineers and even teams who prefer version control and code …</p></article></div></div>

<![CDATA[Why ListenBrainz Moved from InfluxDB to TimescaleDB]]>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div>
		
<p>The <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/">ListenBrainz</a> team has been working hard on moving our primary listen store from <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> to <a href="https://www.timescale.com/">TimescaleDB</a>, and today at UTC 16:00 we’re going to make the switch.</p>



<p>We were asked on Twitter as to why we’re making the switch — and in the interest of giving a real world use case for switching, I’m writing this post. The reasons are numerous:</p>



<p><strong>Openness</strong>: InfluxDB seems on a path that will make it less open over time. TimescaleDB and its dependence on Postgres makes us feel much safer in this regard.</p>



<p><strong>Existing use</strong>: We’ve been using Postgres for about 18 years now and it has been a reliable workhorse for us. Our team thinks in terms of Postgres and InfluxDB  always felt like a round peg in a square hole for us.</p>



<p><strong>Data structure</strong>: InfluxDB was clearly designed to store server event info. We’re storing listen information, which has a slightly different usage pattern, but this slight difference is enough for us to hit a brick wall with far fewer users in our DB than we ever anticipated. InfluxDB is simply not flexible enough for our needs.</p>



<p><strong>Query syntax and measurement names</strong>: The syntax to query InfluxDB is weird and obfuscated. We made the mistake of trying to have a measurement map to a user, but <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/b0846d2a/listenbrainz/utils.py#L42">escaping measurement names correctly</a> nearly drove one of our team members to the loonie bin. </p>



<p><strong>Existing data</strong>: If you ever write bad data to a measurement in InfluxDB, there is no way to change it. I realize that this is a common Big Data usage pattern, but for us it represented significant challenges and serious restrictions to put simple features for our users into place. With TimescaleDB we can make the very occasional UPDATE or DELETE and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Even though we attempted to read as much as possible in order to design a scalable schema, we still failed and got it wrong. (I don’t even think that the docs to calculate scalability even existed when we first started using InfluxDB.) Unless you are using InfluxDB in exactly the way it was meant to be used, there are chances you’ll hit this problem as well. For us, one day insert speed dropped to a ridiculously low number per second, backing up our systems. Digging into the problem we realized that our schema design had a fatal flaw and that we would have drastically change the schema to something even less intuitive in order to fix it.  This was the event that broke the camel’s back and I started searching for alternatives. </p>



<p>In moving to TimescaleDB we were able to delete a ton of complicated code and embrace a DB that we know and love. We know how Postgres scales, we know how to put it into production and we know its caveats. TimescaleDB allows us to be flexible with the data and the amazing queries that can be performed on the data is pure Postgres love. TimescaleDB still requires some careful thinking over using Postgres, it is far less than what is required when using InfluxDB. TimescaleDB also gives us a clear scaling path forward, even when TimescaleDB is still working on their own scaling roadmap. If TimescaleDB evolves anything like Postgres has, I can’t wait to see this evolution.</p>



<p>Big big thanks to the Postgres and TimescaleDB teams! </p>

<![CDATA[GraphQL Query Generator Library by IBM]]>

July 22, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-query-generator/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL Query Generator is an interesting library brought to you by the IBM team, which’s the main idea is to allow users to <strong>generate randomized GraphQL queries</strong> from any given GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>The first thought that comes to your mind might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Why I may ever want a bunch of randomized queries?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>but giving it a second thought it might be quite useful. The team behind the GraphQL Query Generator suggested <strong>two basic use-cases</strong> for their library:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - when operating a GraphQL service you might find this library useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a collection of test modules of GraphQL queries,</li>
<li>developing a test group of queries to check the effect of performance improvements,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific</strong> - to learn about the characteristics of various GraphQL services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries generation</h2>
<p>The library provides two functions for generating random GraphQL queries, both expecting a GraphQL schema, as well as specific  instructions provided in configuration object as an input:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRandomQuery(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> - this function produces a random query from the given schema, considering configuration passed as an input,</li>
<li><code>getRandomMutation(schema: GraphQLSchema, config: Configuration)</code> -  that produces a random mutation from the given schema, considering passed configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The configuration object accepts a set of predefined properties i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxDepth</code> - that defines the maximum depths of the query/mutation to generate,</li>
<li><code>argumentsToIgnore</code> - in which you can  list arguments names that should be ignored,</li>
<li><code>considerInterfaces</code>- which a signal for the generator that it should create queries containing interfaces,</li>
<li><code>considerUnions</code> - that creates queries that contain unions etc.</li>
</ul>

                        Making haskell web apps is a complicated process. You need the right haskell compiler, a build tool, lots of libraries to do useful things and a database software. To make IHP as accessible as possible, we want to initially hide all this from the user. We set out to make IHP usable for people who have not yet heard about ghc and cabal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally when you are using an older compiler version, some library is missing or your postgres is not the right version this will cause trouble. Solving these package management issues is always a huge time sink.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Npm is mainly used for packaging javascript code. Composer is used for packaging php code. And homebrew is used for installing npm and composer ;) Nix is different: It is able to package system software and all kinds of software ecosystems. This is what allows us to bundle all the dependencies of IHP using just a single package manager. Exactly what we need to make a truly batteries-included framework.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Dev Tooling</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is unique in that it allows us to exactly specify the version of a package we want to install. We can say: <i>Install the latest <q>postgres 12.3</q></i>. Nix also allows us to install packages locally for a specific project instead of managing all the dependencies system wide.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        These two properties make nix a great fit to achive our goal of simplifying the package management process. Nix allows us to easily install all this software for developers working with IHP. We can install exactly the right compiler, the right postgres version as well as all the right libraries we need. We can be sure that all packages are installed in the right version (no time sinks!) and nothing is missing. We also don't have any interference with existing packages already installed on the system. It's like docker without the overhead of a VM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The IHP dev server automatically starts and manages a postgres server in the background, just for your project. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23612217" target="_blank">IHP is the first framework tighly integrating the database in the dev mode.</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/zaiste/status/1277678880782979072" target="_blank">We're sure that this will be standard in a couple of years.</a> Without the possibilities of nix, we would have never tried to integrate postgres into the IHP dev server. The integrated database schema designer wouldn't really work that well. It might not be obvious, but without nix we would not have tools like the IHP schema designer or the database viewer.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Pinned Versions</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix makes IHP projects reproducable in a way unseen in other software ecosystems.
                        <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/Config/nix/nixpkgs-config.nix#L21" target="_blank">All IHP projects share exactly the same set of packages.</a> The same compiler version, the same libraries, the same postgres version and even the same custom dependencies your app depends on. <q>Works on my machine</q> will not happen anymore. When there is a problem, other IHP users will most likely already have faced the same issue. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Trade Offs</strong>

                    <p>
                        Nix is far from perfect. Early on we had a lot of problems with slow rebuild times, which we could resolve by using the great <a href="https://cachix.org/" target="_blank">cachix</a> binary cache. Additionally Nix is very hard to install. This is a stumbling block for a lot of people. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/issues/93" target="_blank">Especially when using certain macOS systems you cannot even install nix at all.</a> Luckily most of the nix problems, like the macOS issues will be solved with time. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once nix is set up, it's usually working very well. Over time the benefits of nix really outweight the time spent on solving nix-specific problems. The rising industry adoption of Nix is a good indicator for this. <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix" target="_blank">Cool companies like Shopify are progressively adopting Nix.</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At digitally induced we believe that highest quality software is built on solid foundations.
                        Nix is technological superior to any other existing package manager. Therefore we belive it's right to make nix a hard requirement of IHP. 
                    </p>
                </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>We’ve always believed that our user experience doesn’t just begin when people use elementary OS; it begins from the first moment that someone interacts with our organization in any way. And for a lot of people, that experience starts with our website. You may already know about <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/privacy-and-elementary-os">our stance on privacy</a>, advertising, and tracking from our previous blog posts, and that a core part of our business model is that <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/you-are-not-the-product">you are our customer, not a product</a>.</p>



<p>You might also know that our website has a comprehensive <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/privacy">privacy page</a> that details not only exactly how we use things like cookies on our website, but how to disable them. And with such a strong stance on privacy, you might be asking yourself why elementary uses analytics at all, let alone Google Analytics. To that I am happy to respond that we are leaving Google Analytics behind in favor of the Open Source and privacy-respecting <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-analytics">What Are Analytics?</h2>

<p>If you’re not familiar with the concept, you may be surprised to know that the majority of the websites you regularly visit are collecting statistical data about your usage of the website. Website developers then use this data to optimize infrastructure, pinpoint problems, or even drive design decisions—something we don’t particularly advise.</p>



<p>At elementary, we use anonymous data about things like physical region and download method to make sure we have properly localized HTTPS and Torrent downloads so that you can get a fast and stable connection. We also check which pages are most—and least—visited on our website so we know where to focus improvements. And we pay attention to which operating system downloaders are coming from to make sure that we’re on track with our mission of bringing an Open Source operating system to more people.</p>

<h3 id="why-not-google-analytics">Why Not Google Analytics?</h3>

<p>Google Analytics lets us keep tabs on that data, but Google tracks <em>a whole lot more</em> than that, too. Frankly we don’t want access to that data—or to contribute towards it being collected. Remember, Google’s incentive is to collect as much information as possible from people visiting as many sites as possible—and using Google Analytics directly helps them do that.</p>



<p>If you don’t know, Google happily tracks you across all the websites you visit if those sites use Google Analytics, or if you use Google search. Google then infers and remembers all sorts of information about you; for example: your age range, an inferred gender, if you’ve changed jobs or moved recently, and whether you like to spend time outdoors. Google then uses all of this data to target ads to you, in the hopes that more precise ads will get you to bite, thus earning them their commission.</p>

<p>They then offer those profiles up inside of Google Analytics, letting website owners drill down using “In-Market Segments.” The entire mechanism is invasive—and unnecessary for us. And even though we may choose to ignore these profiles and data, by using Google Analytics on our website, we’ve contributed to creating them. This data collection and surveillance does not align with our values, and we’ve been investigating how we can move away for quite some time now.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Google Analytics is by far the most popular analytics solution available and there are few privacy-respecting alternatives. We considered a few self-hosted products like <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, but we couldn’t find a good fit in terms of maintenance, pricing, and features. We also investigated using self-described privacy-focused <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, but were disappointed to learn that they had gone closed-source since we’d last looked at them. The situation changed once we stumbled upon Plausible.</p>

<p>Plausible is a small UK-based company that provides a hosted, privacy-conscious analytics solution with simple and fair pricing—plus support for custom events. The product itself fits what we’re looking for in an analytics solution, and it’s encouraging to see that they are actively growing and developing new features. But what really got our attention is their messaging around their business model. Read <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding">their blog post on monetizing</a> and see if it sounds familiar.</p>

    No.</p><p>
    "Any interest in talking about an exit?"</p><p>
    No.</p></div>

  
</div>

<p>Unlike Google, Plausible isn’t in the advertising game and doesn’t have an incentive to collect and sell user data. And they’ve made it clear that they’re not interested in being scooped up by VCs or new ownership that might seek to change those values. They make money the same way elementary does: by directly charging customers for their product. We know firsthand how important it is to make sure that your business is built around your ethics, and we get the same feeling from the folks at Plausible. We’re excited to be supporting a company that shares our values and respects the people visiting our website.</p>

<h2 id="improving-transparency">Improving Transparency</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting and unique features of Plausible is their open invitation and celebration of data transparency. First, their entire product is open source; when it comes to privacy, the source code being open and auditable by anyone—experts and end users alike—is paramount. But they go above and beyond that: every user of Plausible is able and encouraged to make their analytics dashboard public so everyone can see the data for themselves and know that nothing fishy is going on.</p>



<p>We’ve embraced this new feature at elementary and opened up the dashboards for our various subdomains as well as our main website. Check them out yourself!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/elementary.io">Main Website</a></li>
  <li><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/blog.elementary.io">Blog</a></li>

  <li><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://plausible.io/releases.elementary.io">Release Tracking</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that this move will provide a tangible improvement to your digital life and give you even more peace of mind when using elementary products. We’re always working towards the ideal and we’re confident we’ve made a big step by switching to Plausible. Let us know on social media what you think of the new public analytics dashboard, and feel free to ask questions about how we’re using this data!</p>

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and their …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I'd done everything right, yet it was 2 am and I still couldn't sleep. I had meditated for 30 minutes before I went to bed. I even took a couple of melatonin pills right after to be sure. Yet, here I was wide awake dreading how exhausted I would be the next day at work.</p><p>My problem wasn't unique. In America, one in every 10 adults will experience chronic insomnia<sup><a href="#references">1</a></sup>. It takes just one poor night of sleep to devolve into long term sleeping problems. This is because the majority of sleeping problems stem from anxiety and worry<sup><a href="#references">2</a></sup>. <b>The more you worry about not getting enough sleep, the worse your sleep gets</b>.</p><p>For me, my sleeping issues began right out of college. I had started a job as a software engineer and I was starting to feel the pressure. I had a couple of big deadlines coming up and I found myself tossing and turning unable to sleep one night. My mind kept racing, thinking about all the work I had until I finally fell asleep.</p><p>I thought that was it — an abnormal night, but then it happened again. This time, my outlook changed. I started worrying about how not getting enough sleep would affect my day. I looked up basic sleep hygiene tips online and decided to go to bed extra early to make sure I made up for lost sleep. This ended up backfiring and it took a few hours before I could finally sleep.</p><p>At this point, my sleeping struggles started becoming more regular. I downloaded a couple of meditation apps in the hopes that meditating and listening to soothing sounds would help me sleep better. I even resorted to over the counter sleeping aids on nights when it took me too long to fall asleep. <b>The results were mixed — I'd fall asleep faster but over time I'd revert back to having poor sleep</b>.</p><p>I finally caved and decided to try prescription medication. I had read a lot about them and was very reluctant because of their long term side effects. On a visit to my doctor, I asked her if she could prescribe me something to help me sleep. She said she said she could, but it wasn't going to be medication. Instead, she put in a referral to a CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) therapist.</p><p>CBT-I is an evidence-based (proven in clinical trials) technique used to treat sleep problems<sup><a href="#references">3</a></sup>. <b>Two driving forces induce sleep — sleep drive &amp; mental arousal</b>. Your sleep drive is how sleepy/tired you feel when going to bed. Your mental arousal is the racing thoughts and alertness you feel when you go to bed. When your sleep drive is high and your arousal levels are low; it is easier to fall asleep. CBT-I prescribes a sleep schedule that ensures you have a high sleep drive. It also teaches you techniques to worry less and reduce your arousal.</p><p><b>CBT-I is extremely effective in treating sleeping problems</b>. Clinical trials have shown that 80% of people that follow a good CBT-I program will have normal sleep by the end<sup><a href="#references">4</a></sup>. The results are also permanent, unlike sleeping aids which are effective only as long as you are taking them<sup><a href="#references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>There were three main rules that I had to follow -</p><ol><li><p>I could only sleep within the sleep window my therapist prescribed. This ensured that I only went to bed when my sleep drive was high.</p></li><li><p>Every time I couldn't sleep, I had to make sure I didn't stay in bed for over 20 minutes. This way, I would subconsciously re-train my mind to not associate my bed with wakefulness<sup><a href="#references">6</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p>No day time naps and no caffeine after 2pm.</p></li></ol><div><p>I was sleeping around 5 hours at the time, so we set a 6 hour window within which I could sleep (1am - 7am in my case). I kept a log of how long it took me to sleep, how long I was awake in the middle of the night and how long I slept. This data was recorded to the closest 15th minute and is self reported. At the end of each week, my therapist would alter my sleep schedule based on the previous week's data.<b> Note:</b> Time awake is the time it took me to fall asleep + my night time awakenings
</p></div><p>
At the end of week 1, I was sleeping about the same as I was before. My time awake at night though had fallen by an hour. I was falling asleep faster and I was having less interrupted sleep. We decided to stick to the same sleep schedule for week 2.
</p><p>
At the end of this week, my sleep had increased and I was consistently awake for less than an hour. We decided to expand my window by 15 minutes for week 3.
</p><p>
We followed the same rules and either expanded or kept the same sleeping window for the next few weeks.
</p><p><b>At the end of the 10 week program, I was sleeping over 7 hours a night</b>. More importantly, I wasn't spending my days worrying about my sleep.
</p><p><b>CBT-I isn't an easy solution</b>. The sleep schedules are hard to follow and the results aren't instantaneous. It takes time and effort but the reward of permanently improved sleep is well worth it. Let me know if you do decide to try it and if it helps you improve your sleep. Here's to hoping you get better sleep soon.</p><p>If you'd like to know more about CBTI and other behavioral therapy techniques to improve sleep, check out our <a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a>!</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><p><a href="http://sleepeducation.org/news/2014/03/10/insomnia-awareness-day-facts-and-stats" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Insomnia Awareness Day by the American Association of Sleep Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sleep Disorders by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.sleepedy.com/cbt-for-insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CBT for Insomnia: A comprehensive guide</a></p></li><li><p>Trauer, James M. et al. “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054060" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Insomnia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.</a> Ann Intern Med.

<p>Medium’s most significant selling points are how easy it is to publish your thoughts and the social aspect of the platform.</p>



<p>However, with ease, comes restrictions.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll discuss how Medium has burned me in the past and why I don’t think it’s the right place for your stories on the web.</p>



<p>Let’s start with:</p>



<h2>My experience with Medium</h2>



<p>When Medium was new, I jumped into the bandwagon, and called it the home for my blog posts for quite some time.</p>



<p>I was happy with the experience. The editor was beautiful, and the presence of community made the platform a suitable place to publish my thoughts, and reach people quickly.</p>



<p>After writing solo for some time, I got accepted to write for a couple of Medium publications like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://medium.com/swlh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Startup</a>, freeCodeCamp, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://byrslf.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Be Yourself</a>.</p>



<p>I thought my blog hosting days were behind me. Medium was going to be my one-stop blogging destination.</p>



<p>But then, came the hammer:</p>



<p>Medium’s content moderation algorithm blocked my profile by mistake without a notice.</p>



<p>I didn’t even realise that my Medium profile wasn’t visible to anyone but me. I assumed since I haven’t written for some time, my views started dropping naturally.</p>



<p>It was until I tried sharing my profile link with a friend did I notice that my profile page returned a 404 error like this:</p>

<p>After contacting Medium Support on Twitter, they unblocked my profile with a reply that my account was flagged mistakenly.</p>



<p>Check this reply from Medium Support:</p>

<p>What’s crazy?</p>



<p>Neither you nor I can stop this from happening again because Medium is a rented land for us.</p>



<p>On the web:</p>



<h2>It’s always better to own your platform</h2>



<p>This advice is accurate for any form of content, be it blog posts or a video.</p>



<p>Until you host your content on your platform, they will always live at the mercy of the company hosting the platform.</p>



<p>I was not the only case where Medium’s algorithm went haywire; it happened with other people as well:</p>

<p>And this is true for other content platforms like YouTube. There had been cases where YouTube videos with tons of views disappeared overnight.</p>

<p>Even though Medium reinstated my profile, I stopped publishing on the platform and moved to my blog again.</p>



<p>You might be thinking:</p>



<h2>What about the virality that comes from Medium’s community?</h2>



<p>It’s true. Medium has a good community. And, if your content catches fire, it will be viral.</p>



<p>However, that’s not always the case. I have had very few organic traffic from Medium.</p>



<p>Most of my articles had traffic from external sources. Here are some stats for you:</p>

<p>Even if you manage to score a good amount of traffic on your content on Medium, it’s wise to use this opportunity to build an initial traction for your blog.</p>



<p>A lot of companies like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Basecamp</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a> executed this idea with their company blogs.</p>



<p>They started with a Medium publication, and when they gained traction on their content, they moved to their own hosted blogs.</p>



<p>Coincidentally:</p>



<p>I was listening to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1370USFCRZJnv2BXc631pq" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast episode</a>&nbsp;a few days back where a YouTuber said that he is building his platform to prevent his content from being taken down by YouTube.</p>



<p>That said:</p>



<h2>Medium is still suitable for some cases</h2>



<p>There are situations when Medium is the best choice for writers. Some of them are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blogging casually. </strong>When you’re just jotting your thoughts down and don’t care about your brand, Medium can be a right fit for those occasional brain dumps.</li><li><strong>Not being able to afford hosting fees.</strong> Hosting your blog costs money, whereas Medium is free.</li><li><strong>Quick money.</strong> Earning money from your blog takes time. On Medium, however, you can put your story behind a paywall and make money from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187-Join-the-Partner-Program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medium’s Partner Program</a>.</li></ul>



<p>However, if you’re serious about blogging, you should always focus on your own blog.</p>



<p>Apart from the freedom to publish anything you want, you’ll also get unlimited branding and customisation options on your blog.</p>



<p>Medium allows only a handful of customisations for publications and little to nothing for the article content.</p>



<p>Even the everyday use cases like syntax highlighting requires jumping through multiple hoops to make it possible.</p>



<p>Also, Medium <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003053487-Custom-Domains-service-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stopped allowing custom domains</a> for publications starting <strong>November, 2017</strong>. That means, your publication will have an URL structure like this:</p>



<p><mark>medium.com/yourpublication</mark></p>



<p>There’s, however, one approach where you can make Medium work for you with acceptable side-effects.</p>



<p>How?</p>



<h2>Mirror your blog on Medium</h2>



<p>This technique isn’t something I invented. I have seen a lot of established authors like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://dariusforoux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Darius Foroux</a> do this regularly and I tried it on my own as well.</p>



<p>The concept is to publish first on your own blog and then later republish the same content on Medium.</p>



<p>You can either create a publication on Medium for reposting or publish under your profile.</p>



<p>And at the end of each article, add a byline which links to the original article on your site.</p>



<p>The benefit of this approach is that while your content is safely resting on your blog, you can leverage Medium and get more eyeballs for your writing.</p>



<p>However, there’s a catch, SEO-wise.</p>



<p>Since Medium has a high domain authority on Google Search, your articles on Medium might outrank the same articles published on your blog.</p>



<p>Also, Google might add negative signals for your website, thinking that you copy-pasted an article from Medium on your blog.</p>



<p>Tread carefully.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> As pointed out in the comments section, Medium has an&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-a-post" rel="noreferrer noopener">import tool</a>&nbsp;which allows you to add a canonical link from your Medium post to your original blog post. </p>



<p>This process ensures that Google does not think of your blog post as a duplicate. Thanks to Nicolas and Matthias for this correction.&nbsp;🥂</p>



<h2>Tell me about your strategy</h2>



<p>Now that you know the disadvantages of blogging on Medium, what do you think?</p>



<p>Will you be <a href="https://hulry.com/back-to-wordpress/">moving your blog</a> from Medium? Or vice-versa?</p>



<p>Have you already moved from Medium? Love to hear that story too.</p>

      <h2 id="hive-and-presto">Hive and Presto</h2>
<p>Hive and Presto have developed a tortoise-and-hare story over the past 8 years.
Initially conceived at Facebook and open sourced in August 2008,
Hive was hailed as a breakthrough in the SQL-on-Hadoop technology
and generally regarded as the de facto standard.
Then in 2012,
Facebook started to develop Presto as a replacement of Hive,
which was considered too slow for their daily workload.
As Facebook was specific about its goal in developing Presto,
the future of Hive did not look so bright.</p>
<p>The activity in the Hive community, however, did not dwindle at all.
In February 2013,
the Hive community, spearheaded by Hortonworks, embarked on the Stinger Initiative with the aim of achieving 100x performance improvement.
The outcome of the Stinger Initiative was impressive.
The integration of a new execution engine Tez eliminated the most costly overhead in its original execution engine MapReduce,
and the introduction of LLAP (Low Latency Analytical Processing) brought the performance to the next level.
The in-memory cache implemented in LLAP was also a timely response to the separation of compute and storage.</p>
<p>Eventually Hive has come to outperform Presto by a large margin.
The following graph summarizes the result of evaluating Hive 3.1.2 and Presto 317 on the TPC-DS benchmark with a scale factor of 10 terabytes
(with details in our <a href="https://www.datamonad.com/2019-08-22-comparison-presto317-0.10/">previous article</a>).
In the experiment, we use Hive on MR3 which is comparable to Hive-LLAP in performance.
We observe that with respect to the geometric mean of running times,
<strong>Hive runs three times faster than Presto: 30.83 seconds for Hive vs 90.07 seconds for Presto.</strong>
This is no easy feat from a technical perspective, especially because Hive supports fault tolerance whereas Presto does not.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.0.10/presto.hive.time.new.wide-fs8.png" alt="presto.hive.time.new.wide"></p>
<h2 id="why-choose-presto-over-hive">Why choose Presto over Hive?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless Presto has its own strengths
and is <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Presto">rising rapidly in popularity</a> (as of July 2020).
Interestingly its speed is one of its selling points
as many industrial users are still under the mistaken impression that Presto is much faster than Hive.
For our purpose,
we focus on the following core strength of Presto among others – easy installation.</p>
<p>Presto is easy to install.
It suffices to copy the binary distribution of Presto in the installation directory on every node,
whether in a Hadoop cluster or not.
In order to run Presto,
the user configures the installation as either a coordinator or a worker and executes a common script on each node.
After starting a coordinator, the user can launch workers in any order,
which implies that it is also straightforward to add new workers later.
The ease and simplicity of the installation process is achievable because Presto has relatively few dependencies.</p>
<p>This strength of Presto, however, really shines in an environment where Docker containers are supported, most notably on Kubernetes.
A Docker image can be easily built from the binary distribution of Presto,
and after creating a Docker container for a coordinator, the user can create or delete as many Docker containers for workers as necessary.
In essence, running Presto with Docker containers is no different from running it directly with the binary distribution.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, installing Hive is a daunting task.
First of all, the user should find a Hadoop cluster compatible with Hive to be installed.
For example, in order to install Hive 3, the user should either upgrade an existing cluster to Hadoop 3 or create a new Hadoop 3 cluster.
Then the user should install a compatible version of Tez.
Finally the user should check other dependencies, such as ZooKeeper, in order to use advanced features of Hive such as LLAP.
The difficulty and complexity of the installation process is inevitable because Hive has relatively many dependencies, including Hadoop itself.</p>
<p>‘‘Easy installation’’ is a distinctive feature of Presto that is certainly helping to accelerate its adoption, especially in the cloud environment.
In comparison, Hive is struggling even in the Hadoop environment.
It is not uncommon to see potential users switching to Presto
just at the thought of having to upgrade the Hadoop cluster or after failing to configure LLAP properly.
Perhaps not by coincidence,
<strong>Hive is now <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_trend/system/Hive">gradually losing its popularity after its peak in December 2019</a></strong> (as of July 2020).</p>
<h2 id="hive-on-mr3----a-new-alternative">Hive on MR3 – a new alternative</h2>
<p>Hive on MR3 has been developed with the goal of facilitating the use of Hive, both on Hadoop and on Kubernetes, by exploiting a new execution engine MR3.
As such, Hive on MR3 is much easier to install than the original Hive.
On Hadoop, it suffices to copy the binary distribution in the installation directory on the master node.
On Kubernetes,
the user can build a Docker image from the binary distribution (or use a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/mr3project">pre-built image</a>)
and clone the <a href="https://github.com/mr3project/mr3-run-k8s">GitHub repository</a> containing all the scripts.</p>
<p>Hive on MR3 not only retains all the strengths of Hive, but also supports additional features unique to MR3.
For example,
<a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/fault-tolerance/">fault tolerance</a> is more mature than in Tez and Spark,
<a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/autoscaling/">autoscaling</a> is assisted by MR3 itself (rather than relying on an external monitor),
and multiple shuffle handlers can run inside a single container so as to <a href="https://mr3docs.datamonad.com/docs/mr3/features/fetchdelay/">eliminate fetch delays</a>.
As it is agnostic to the underlying file system, Hive on MR3 fully supports the separation of compute and storage.</p>
<p>Now suppose that a new user wants to try Hive on MR3 in a Hadoop cluster.
The reader may well think that it is a no-brainer to choose Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.
<strong>We, however, recommend Hadoop on MR3 on Kubernetes, even in a Hadoop cluster.</strong>
Below we explain why.</p>
<h2 id="hive-on-mr3-on-kubernetes-running-in-a-hadoop-cluster">Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes running in a Hadoop cluster</h2>
<p>While it generally runs stable in a typical Hadoop cluster,
Hive on MR3 on Hadoop may run into subtle problems due to conflicting configurations.
Here are a few examples of such problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kerberos authentication does not work well because an old version of Java with no support for the unlimited cryptography policy is installed.</li>
<li>High availability does not work because an incompatible version of ZooKeeper is running.</li>
<li>The user cannot install Ranger (for managing data security) dedicated to Hive on MR3 because an old version of Ranger is already running.</li>
<li>It is not easy to run multiple instances of HiveServer2 each with its own security policy.</li>
<li>On Cloudera CDH, the user should use MR3 based on Hadoop 2.7 in order to run Hive 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>By running Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes,
all such problems either disappear completely or are alleviated considerably.
The reason is two-fold: 1) all components now run in a containerized environment and thus the user controls everything;
2) the use of Kubernetes eliminates the need for advanced features specific to Hadoop such as high availability.
Moreover Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes is easier to operate than Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.
For example, it is easy to run multiple instances of HiveServer2 each with its own security policy while sharing all the resources.</p>
<p>Running Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes in a Hadoop cluster, however, may have two new problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kubernetes may conflict with Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes may run slower than Hive on MR3 on Hadoop.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first problem,
Kubernetes and Hadoop can coexist in the same cluster
because Kubernetes (written in Go) and Hadoop (written in Java) share practically no dependencies.
(After installing Kubernetes in a Hadoop cluster, the user can stop Yarn which is no longer needed.)
For the second problem, <strong>the performance penalty does exist because of the use of Docker containers,
but is acceptable with the release of MR3 1.1.</strong></p>
<h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental results</h2>
<p>To measure the performance penalty inherent in Kubernetes,
we run an experiment with the following settings (where we use both Hive 3 and Hive 4):</p>
<ul>
<li>A cluster of 42 nodes each with 24 cores, 96 gigabytes of memory, and 6 HDDs</li>
<li>10 gigabit network switch</li>

<p>Here is the summary (all measurements in seconds):</p>

<p>We make the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>With respect to the total running time,
<ul>
<li>Hive 3 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 12.8 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive 4 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 18.4 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With respect to the geometric mean of running times,
<ul>
<li>Hive 3 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 7.8 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
<li>Hive 4 on MR3 on Kubernetes is 1.0 percent slower than on Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We claim that the performance penalty is in an acceptable range and does not outweigh the benefit conferred by Kubernetes.
The following graphs show that end users are not very likely to notice the difference in performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.1.1/hive3.hadoop.vs.k8s-fs8.png" alt="hive3.hadoop.vs.k8s">
<img src="https://www.datamonad.com/img/mr3.1.1/hive4.hadoop.vs.k8s-fs8.png" alt="hive4.hadoop.vs.k8s"></p>
<p>As a side note, we find that Hive 4 runs noticeably faster than Hive 3 on average,
and that Hive 3 and Hive 4 differ in the result of query 18 and query 22.</p>
<p>Thus the bottomline is:
<strong>if you are new to Hive, try Hive on MR3;
if you are new to Hive on MR3, try Hive on MR3 on Kubernetes, whether in a Hadoop cluster or not.</strong></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I have been working in the BI/Analytics field for a long time and have seen a lot of disruptive technologies in this space going through the hype cycle. Moving from SMP technologies to MPP databases, the era of Hadoop, the meteoric rise of Python and R for data science, serverless architectures and data lakes on cloud platforms etc. ensured that this industry stays more vibrant than ever. I see new frameworks, tools and paradigms raising to the surface almost daily and there are always new things to learn and explore. A few weeks ago, I had an interesting conversation with a recruiter about what’s trendy and interesting in the space of BI and Analytics and what the businesses she’s been helping with resourcing are looking for in terms of the IT talent pool. I was expecting to hear things like AI PaaS, Synthetic Data, Edge Analytics and all the interesting (and over-hyped) stuff that the cool kids in Silicon Valley are getting into. Instead, she asserted that apart from public cloud platforms and all the run-of-the-mill BI tools like PowerBI and Looker, there is a growing demand for Snowflake projects. Mind you, this is an Australian market so chances are your neck of the woods may look completely different, but suffice to say, I didn’t expect a company not affiliated with a major public cloud provider to become so popular, particularly in this already congested market for cloud data warehousing solutions.</p>
<p>Snowflake, a direct competitor to Amazon’s Redshift, Microsoft’s Synapse and Google’s BigQuery, has been around for some time, but only recently I also started hearing more about it becoming the go-to technology for storing and processing large volumes of data in the cloud. I was also surprised to see Snowflake positioned in the ‘Leaders’ quadrant in the Data Management Solutions for Analytics chart, dethroning the well-known and respected industry stalwarts such as Vertica or Greenplum.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to look at Snowflake performance characteristics by creating a TPC-DS benchmark schema and executing a few analytical queries to see how it fares in comparison to some of the other MPP databases I worked with and/or tested. It’s not supposed to be an exhaustive overview or test and as such, these benchmark results should not be taken as Gospel. Having worked with databases all my career, I always look forward to exploring new technologies and even though I don’t expect to utilise Snowflake in my current project, it’s always exciting to kick the tires on a new platform or service.</p>
<p>OK, let’s dive in and see what’s in store!</p>
<h3>Snowflake Architecture Primer</h3>
<p>Snowflake claims to be built for cloud from the ground-up and does not offer on-premise deployment option, it’s a purely data warehouse as a service (DWaaS) offering. Everything – from database storage infrastructure to the compute resources used for analysis and optimisation of data – is handled by Snowflake. In this respect, Snowflake is not that much different from Google’s BigQuery although it’s difficult to contrast those two, mainly due to different pricing models (excluding storage cost) – BigQuery charges per volume of data scanned whereas Snowflake went with a more traditional model i.e. compute size and resource time allocation.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk database architectures and shared-nothing database architectures. Similar to shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data that is accessible from all compute nodes in the data warehouse. But just like shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using massively parallel processing compute clusters, where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture, but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s unique architecture consists of three key layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Storage – When data is loaded into Snowflake, Snowflake reorganizes that data into its internaly optimized, compressed, columnar format. Snowflake stores this optimized data in cloud storage. Snowflake manages all aspects of how this data is stored — the organization, file size, structure, compression, metadata, statistics, and other aspects of data storage are handled by Snowflake. The data objects stored by Snowflake are not directly visible nor accessible by customers; they are only accessible through SQL query operations run using Snowflake</li>
<li>Query Processing – Query execution is performed in the processing layer. Snowflake processes queries using “virtual warehouses”. Each virtual warehouse is an MPP compute cluster composed of multiple compute nodes allocated by Snowflake from a cloud provider. Each virtual warehouse is an independent compute cluster that does not share compute resources with other virtual warehouses. As a result, each virtual warehouse has no impact on the performance of other virtual warehouses</li>
<li>Cloud Services – The cloud services layer is a collection of services that coordinate activities across Snowflake. These services tie together all of the different components of Snowflake in order to process user requests, from login to query dispatch. The cloud services layer also runs on compute instances provisioned by Snowflake from the cloud provider</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content//2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png"><img src="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content//2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png" alt="" width="580" height="334" srcset="http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content/2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level.png 765w, http://bicortex.com/bicortex/wp-content/post_content/2020/07/Snowflake_Architecture_High_Level-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Snowflake can be hosted on any of the top three public cloud provides i.e. Azure, AWS and GCP across different regions, baring in mind that Snowflake accounts do not support multi-region deployments.</p>
<h3>Loading TPC-DS Data</h3>
<p>Data can be loaded into Snowflake is a number of ways, for example, using established ETL/ELT tools, using Snowpipe for continuous loading, WebUI or SnowSQL, and in a variety of formats e.g. JSON, AVRO, Parquet, CSV, Avro or XML. There are a few things to keep in mind when loading data into Snowflake which relate to file size, file splitting, file staging etc. The general recommendation is to produce files roughly 10MB to 100MB in size, compressed. Data loads of large Parquet files e.g. greater than 3GB could time out, therefore it is best practice to split those into smaller files to distribute the load among the servers in an active warehouse.</p>
<p>In order to run the TPC-DS queries on the Snowflake warehouse, I loaded the sample CSV-format data (scale factor of 100 and 300) from my local storage into the newly created schema using a small Python script. Snowflake also provides for staging files in public clouds object and blob storage e.g. AWS S3 but in this exercise, I transferred those from my local hard drive and staged them internally in Snowflake. As TPC-DS data does not conform to some of the requirements outlined above, the following script processed those files to ensure the format and size are consistent. The below script enables files’ format renaming (from DAT to CSV), breaking up larger files into smaller ones and removing trailing characters from line endings. It also creates the required TPC-DS schema and loads pre-processed data into its objects.</p>

Rose's <em>testimonia</em>&nbsp;of a work attributed to Aristotle called <em>Magic (</em>ὁ Μαγικός λόγος, or τὸ μαγικόν?). The title either refers to the art practised by the Magi (the Zoroastrian priests from Persia), or it refers to the fact that the discussion is a discussion about the Magi. The latter seems more likely, even though the first passage, from Diogenes Laertius, suggests the discussion mentioned all sorts of wisdom cults.</p><p>The attribution is disputed. Diogenes Laertius says it is by Aristotle, but doesn't put it in his list of Aristotle's works (it doesn't show up in any other list I've looked at in either Greek or Arabic). The Suda says it is by Antisthenes, and that some people attributed it to Aristotle or someone named Rhodon. It's not clear where the Suda is getting this from.</p><p>While we don't know who wrote it, its contents are hinted at by the testimonies gathered in Rose (+ a few others I've put together). Diogenes reports that Aristotle thought magic wasn't sorcery, but philosophy or wisdom. This is confirmed by the Suda. It has something to do with prognostication. Eudoxus, according to Pliny,&nbsp;believed it was useful and very valuable, and so it was not only practical but connected to more valuable objects of study, probably the heavenly bodies. This is especially supported by the etymology of Zoroaster ('star-diviner') reported by Diogenes,&nbsp;and Porphyry's etymology of 'magus' as 'wise in divine matters'. Philo specifies that it was a kind of 'optics'&nbsp;and a very precise branch of natural science. Finally, Philo, Porphyry and the Suda associate it with both wisdom <em>and </em>with kingship. Philo says not only private citizens practice magic, but that Persian kings themselves had to be educated as Magi to become king.</p><p>It seems to me as if all these testimonies could be referring to a discussion of wise philosopher kings who are able to predict the future through their understanding of the heavens and the science of nature.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520798591087_18030"><div><p>"Some say the work of philosophy originated with the barbarians. For among the Persians are the Magi, among the Babylonians and Assyrians the Chaldeans, among the Indians the Gymnosophists (lit. naked philosophers), and among the Celts and Gauls, those called 'Druids' and holy people, according to what Aristotle says in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Sotion in the twenty-third book of the <em>Succession of Philosophers</em>."</p><p>Τὸ τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἔνιοί φασιν ἀπὸ βαρβάρων ἄρξαι. γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ μὲν Πέρσαις μάγους, παρὰ δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις ἢ Ἀσσυρίοις Χαλδαίους, καὶ γυμνοσοφιστὰς παρ' Ἰνδοῖς, παρά τε Κελτοῖς καὶ Γαλάταις τοὺς καλουμένους δρυίδας καὶ σεμνοθέους, καθά φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ μαγικῷ καὶ Σωτίων ἐν εἰκοστῷ τρίτῳ τῆς διαδοχῆς.</p><p><strong>Diogenes Laertius, <em>Lives of the Eminent Philosophers</em>, 1.1</strong></p><p>"The Magi were ignorant of sorcerers' magic, says Aristotle in the book on <em>Magic </em>and Dinon in the fifth book of his <em>Histories</em>. He also says 'Zoroaster' when translated literally means 'star-diviner'; Hermodorus says this as well. In the first book of <em>On Philosophy</em>, Aristotle says they (the Magi) are actually older than the Egyptians. And according to them there are two principles, a good daimon and a bad daimon: to the former, the name is Zeus and 'Oromasdes' [i.e., Ahura Mazda], to the other Hades and 'Arimanius' [i.e., Ahriman]. Hermippus says this too in the first book <em>On Magi</em>, so does Eudoxus in the <em>Survey</em>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of the <em>Philippics</em>."</p><p>Τὴν δὲ γοητικὴν μαγείαν [sc. οἱ Μάγοι] οὐδ' ἔγνωσαν, φησὶν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Μαγικῷ καὶ Δείνων ἐν τῇ πέμπτῃ τῶν Ἱστοριῶν· ὃς καὶ μεθερμηνευόμενόν φησι τὸν Ζωροάστρην ἀστροθύτην εἶναι· φησὶ δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Ἑρμόδωρος.

He was the son of a father with the same name, and his mother came from the people of Thrace. He wrote these ten volumes: first, <em>Magic</em>: it tells about a certain <em>magus</em>, Zoroaster, who discovered wisdom. Some people attribute this to Aristotle, others to Rhodon."</p><p>Ἀντισθένης, Ἀθηναῖος, ἀπὸ ῥητόρων φιλόσοφος Σωκρατικός, ὅστις Περιπατητικὸς ἐκλήθη πρῶτον, εἶτα ἐκύνισεν: υἱὸς δὲ ὢν ὁμωνύμου πατρὸς, μητρὸς δὲ τὸ γένος Θρᾴσσης. οὗτος συνέγραψε τόμους δέκα: πρῶτον μαγικόν: ἀφηγεῖται δὲ περὶ Ζωροάστρου τινὸς μάγου, εὑρόντος τὴν σοφίαν: τοῦτο δέ τινες Ἀριστοτέλει, οἱ δὲ Ῥόδωνι ἀνατιθέασιν.</p><p><strong>Suda, s.v.

<p>By Lane Wagner –&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane">@wagslane</a> on Twitter</p>



<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Let’s explore the basics of lattices and how they apply to cryptosystems.</p>



<h2><span id="What_is_a_Lattice">What is a Lattice?</span>
</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>

<h2><span id="How_Does_This_Help_With_Crypto">How Does This Help With Crypto?</span>
</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of 27,919,645,564,169,759, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 are prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>

<p>In this introductory article, we will take a brief look at one of the more well-known lattice problems that are of use in cryptosystems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)">the shortest vector problem (SVP)</a>.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

<hr>
<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is an efficient modern approach to public-key cryptosystems. In this introduction, our goal will be to focus on the high-level principles of what makes ECC work. We will omit implementation details and mathematical proofs, we can save those for another article.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Its_For">What It’s&nbsp;For?</span>
</h2>



<p>A common use of ECC is to encrypt data so that only authorized parties can decrypt it. This has several obvious use cases but is most often used to encrypt internet traffic. For example, we can use ECC to ensure that when we send an email, no one but the recipient can read the message.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="ECC_is_public_key_cryptography">ECC is public key cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>There are many types of public-key cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is just one flavor. Other algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Helman, etc. I’m going to give a very simple background of public-key cryptography as a jumping-off point so that we can discuss ECC and build on top of these ideas. By all means, study more in-depth on public-key cryptography when you have the time.</p>



<p>Public-key cryptography allows the following to happen:</p>







<p>We create two keys, a public key, and a private key. The public key is given freely, and any party can encrypt data by using it. However, the private key is kept secret and only those who hold it will have the ability to decrypt data.</p>



<h2><span id="An_Example_of_Public-Key-Cryptography">An Example of Public-Key-Cryptography</span>
</h2>



<p>Let’s pretend that Facebook is going to receive a private post from Donald Trump. Facebook needs to be able to ensure that when the President sends his post over the internet, no one in the middle (Like the NSA, or internet service provider) can read the message. The entire exchange using Public Key Cryptography would go like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump Notifies Facebook that he wants to send them a private post</li>
<li>Facebook sends Donald Trump their public key</li>
<li>Donald Trump uses the public key to encrypt his post:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key = “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<ul>
<li>Donald Trump sends only the encrypted message to Facebook</li>
<li>Facebook uses its private key to decrypt the message:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s” + Private Key= “I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>As you can see this is a very useful concept. Here are some key points:</p>



<ul>
<li>The public key can be sent to anyone. It is public.</li>
<li>The private key must be kept safe because if someone in the middle were to get the private key, they could decrypt messages.</li>
<li>Computers can very quickly use the public key to encrypt a message, and the private key to decrypt a message.</li>
<li>Computers require a very long time (millions of years) to derive the original data from the encrypted message if they don’t have the private key.</li>
</ul>

<p>The crux of all public-key cryptographic algorithms is that they each have their own unique trapdoor function<strong>. </strong>A trapdoor function is a function that can only be computed one way, or at least can only be computed one way <em>easily</em> (in less than millions of years using modern computers).</p>



<p>Not a trapdoor function: <em>A + B = C</em></p>



<p>If I’m given A and B I can compute C. The problem is that if I’m given B and C I can also compute A. This is not a trapdoor function.</p>



<p>Trapdoor function:</p>



<p><em>“I love Fox and Friends” + Public Key –&gt; “s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em></p>



<p>If given <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em> and the public key, I can produce <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em>, but if given <em>“s80s1s9sadjds9s”</em> and the Public Key I can’t produce <em>“I love Fox and Friends”</em></p>



<p>In RSA (Probably the most popular public-key system) the trapdoor function relies on how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors.</p>



<p>Public Key:<em> 944,871,836,856,449,473</em></p>



<p>Private Key: <em>961,748,941</em> and <em>982,451,653</em></p>



<p>In the example above the public key is a very large number, and the private key is the two prime factors of the public key. This is a good example of a Trapdoor Function because it is very easy to multiply the numbers in the private key together to get the public key, but if all you have is the public key it will take a very long time using a computer to re-create the private key.</p>



<p><em>Note: In real cryptography, the private key would need to be 200+ digits long to be considered secure.</em></p>



<h2><span id="What_Makes_Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography_Different">What Makes Elliptic Curve Cryptography Different?</span>
</h2>



<p>You would use ECC for the same reasons as RSA. ECC and RSA both generate a public and private key and allows two parties to communicate securely.</p>

<h2><span id="ECCs_Trapdoor_Function">ECC’s Trapdoor&nbsp;Function</span>
</h2>



<p>This is probably why most of you are here. The trapdoor function is what makes ECC special and different than RSA. The trapdoor function is similar to a mathematical game of pool. First, we start with a certain point on the curve. Next, we use a function (called the dot function) to find a new point. Finally, we keep repeating the dot function to hop around the curve until we finally end up at our last point. Lets walk through the algorithm.</p>







<ul>
<li>Starting at A:</li>
<li>A dot B = -C (Draw a line from A to B and it intersects at -C)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -C to C</li>
<li>A dot C = -D (Draw a line from A to C and it intersects -D)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -D to D</li>
<li>A dot D = -E (Draw a line from A to D and it intersects -E)</li>
<li>Reflect across the X axis from -E to E</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great trapdoor function because if you know where the starting point (A) is and how many hops are required to get to the ending point (E), it is very easy to find the ending point. On the other hand, if all you know is where the starting point and ending point are, it is nearly impossible to find how many hops it took to get there.</p>



<p>Public Key: Starting Point A, Ending Point E</p>



<p>Private Key: Number of hops from A to E</p>



<h2><span id="Questions">Questions?</span>
</h2>



<p>Here are just a couple of questions I had when I first learned about ECC. Hopefully, I can address them properly.</p>



<h3><span id="How_is_the_second_point_found_If_the_dot_function_is_basically_drawing_a_line_between_two_points_dont_you_need_a_second_point_to_start_with">How is the second point found? If the dot function is basically drawing a line between two points, don’t you need a second point to start&nbsp;with?</span>
</h3>



<p>Answer: No. The second point (we will call it -R below) is actually the result of P dot P (let’s assume the first point is called P)</p>



<p>P dot P= -R</p>



<p>So what is P dot P? It is actually just the tangent line of P. See the graphic below:</p>







<h3><span id="What_happens_if_the_dot_function_produces_a_line_that_will_go_way_off_out_to_some_extreme">What happens if the dot function produces a line that will go way off out to some&nbsp;extreme?</span>
</h3>



<p>If the line doesn’t hit the curve close to the origin, we can actually define a maximum X value where the line will wrap back around and start from the beginning again. See the graphic below for an example.</p>







<h3><span id="I_get_the_trapdoor_function_but_how_are_public_and_private_keys_created_in_practice_How_are_they_used_in_conjunction_with_data_to_be_encrypted">I get the trapdoor function, but how are public and private keys created in practice? How are they used in conjunction with data to be encrypted?</span>
</h3>



<p>This is a great question, but it requires a much more in-depth answer. I gave very hand-wavy explanations of both RSA and ECC in this article. However, there are plenty of more technical resources out there and I encourage you to look into them.</p>



<hr>
<h2><span id="Who_Cares">Who Cares?</span>
</h2>



<p>ECC is used as the cryptographic key algorithm in Bitcoin because it potentially can save 90% of the resources used by a similar RSA system. It seems that each year we see more systems moving from a bloaty RSA system to a more modern elliptic curve approach. Hopefully, we’ve helped you gain a high-level understanding ECC and public-key cryptography.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If ever there has been a time to rethink the very fabric and foundation of families, it’s now. After 5 years of working on the front lines of building solutions for families, there are many things I could tell you about how broken things are. But today, I’d rather focus on the story of what can be.</p><p>Pre-COVID, the harsh reality I would have told you is: the way we think about our families is stuck in the 1950s (at least – the school calendar is firmly stuck in the agrarian realities of the 1800s). We still have this utopian notion of the “traditional nuclear family” where one person (the man) is the breadwinner and the other person (the woman) is the homemaker. They live comfortably in the suburbs, earn a family wage and have the safety nets of community and company pensions. Even if this view served a particular sliver of America well back then, it simply does not describe families now.</p><p>Our family infrastructure has not evolved with the reality of families. More than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marybethferrante/2020/03/06/millennial-working-parents-you-are-poised-to-fight-gender-equality/#329175c63c78">78% of millennial couples</a> (the people with the young kids today) are dual working.<em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/#:~:text=Almost%20a%20quarter%20of%20U.S.,who%20do%20so%20(7%25)"> </a></em><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/#:~:text=Almost%20a%20quarter%20of%20U.S.,who%20do%20so%20(7%25)">Almost a quarter of kids</a> are being raised in single-parent households. What family looks like has never been more varied.<br>In the ultimate irony, we say that families are the cornerstone of our society, but we’re not willing to see that that foundation is crumbling and barely holding up. Over the past 3 decades, as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-child-care-so-expensive/602599/">childcare costs have nearly doubled</a> and the number of dual working households has climbed, we’ve asked parents to continue to push through, making them feel like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/opinion/sunday/the-real-mommy-war-is-against-the-state.html">failure was theirs when they came up short</a> .</p><p>But in a post-COVID world? There is no hiding from the fact of how broken systems are for today’s parents. If there are any silver linings, it’s that this crisis has laid bare the cracks. It has pushed parents to and over the edge of trying to just “muscle through”.</p></div><p>So one way or another, there will be change as we do the hard, messy work of reimagining what having a family in the 21st century should look like. And while they’re interrelated, this change falls roughly into five categories:</p><div><p>This is vast and complicated terrain, but here are 12 ideas and conversation starters that can help us reimagine and rebuild the future we want to live in:</p><p><strong><em>In the future:</em><br>1. Parents won’t have to choose between quality of care and its cost.</strong><br>Today, because US parents are expected to shoulder the vast majority of the cost related to childcare, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/parents-spending-42-billion-on-early-child-care-each-year.html#:~:text=That's%20on%20par%20with%20other,on%20summer%20child%20care%20alone">access to high-quality, affordable care is hard to come by</a>.</p><p>That pushes parents to compromise on quality and keeps childcare in the grey. First stop to change? Effective gov’t and employer-supported childcare/early ed. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/us/politics/biden-workplace-childcare.html">Today’s announcement from Joe Biden</a> is a promising start.</p><p><strong>2. We’ll have access to $10/day daycare.</strong><br>It’s a time for boldness and nothing is as bold as the idea of <a href="https://www.10aday.ca/">$10/day daycare</a> as it is in places like Canada, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Australia. Not a coincidence, those same countries have the highest female labor participation rates in the world. But it needs to be a national priority.</p><p><strong>3. Childcare will be a profession, and great caregivers will be rewarded as such.</strong><br>Right now, it’s impossible to make a real living doing childcare or eldercare. It’s a transient occupation that can’t sustain someone as a career — but it shouldn’t be that way. To fix childcare quality and supply problems, we have to first make it a profession that is worth having – financially and emotionally. With clear qualifications, access to benefits and proper wages (current averages are $9-15/hr – no wonder most is in the gray economy), we can start to build the childcare system we all need.</p><p><strong>4. Welcome to the Club: New parents will feel supported from the start.</strong><br>Ideas like the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415">Finnish baby box</a> and <a href="https://www.peps.org/">PEPS</a> will be for every parent, to ensure every baby has an equal start on life and that parents never feel alone in their journey.</p><p><strong>5. Parental Leave: Universal access to paid leave for both mothers and fathers.</strong><br>Advances in leave will include offering leave for both parents. The Swedish system offers 16 mo, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-maternity-leave-paternity-leave-policies-latte-dads-2018-4#:~:text=The%20Swedish%20government%20says%20that,child%20is%208%20years%20old">available until the child is 8, which are shared across both parents</a> . There are also other options, like what the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/upshot/paid-parental-leave-sweet-spot-six-months-gates.html">Gates Foundation offers</a> , of 6 mo leave + $20K stipend for childcare/other costs.</p><p><strong>6. Change the default: Women will no longer be the default primary parent.</strong><br>Today, from maternity leave to which parent gets the call from school, we default to the <a href="https://www.mother.ly/life/true-life-im-the-default-parent">mother as primary parent</a> . In the future, we won’t assume it’s the mother caring for kids full-time or opting for a flex job. We’ll explicitly ask for and acknowledge each family’s preference. No assumptions.</p><p><strong>7. Fluid careers. It will no longer be so punitive to take career breaks.</strong><br>Whether paid (as in the Swedish system until the kid is 8) or unpaid, parents will be able to step in and out of the workforce with less friction. It will be commonplace to have “resume gaps” that tie to caregiving responsibilities, and that experience will count for something instead of being shoved under the rug. Right now, it is incredibly hard for parents (mostly women) to come back into the workforce after having kids making it too punitive to take a step out of the workforce.</p><p>In the future, it will be much easier to take this approach post kids, tag teaming with a partner to come in and out of the workplace. We know that there are so many ways you can concoct a career today. We don’t have to stick to this default / linear model of “start working at 22 and stop at 65” and employers will be active participants in building family-friendly career paths.</p><p><strong>8. HomeTech will be about connecting the people, not the things.</strong><br>Right now,, the race is to connect lightbulbs, doorbells and speakers in our homes. In future, we’ll be more concerned about connecting the people. HomeTech will make information around care, schedules and development central and collaborative among household members.</p><p><strong>9. Design for collaboration.</strong><br>One simple example is to<strong> </strong>make household accounts the standard. Most software requires users to create their own accounts. For family-related services, like accounts related to kids’ activities, this is challenging – the best solution for parents is often to insecurely share one login. We need to make the idea of Household accounts the norm, to which you can attach any number of users with different settings and preferences.</p><p><strong>10. Superstar teachers will be the rule, not the exception.</strong><br>What would it take for teachers to have the same spotlight as top celebrities? Wouldn’t it be incredible to live in a country where teachers are idolized? We need to celebrate and reward this critical profession in a way that not only attracts the best minds, but keeps them engaged and innovating in the most important investment sector we have.</p><p><strong>11. Role for everyone in the neighborhood.</strong><br>Today’s communities are very siloed, especially generationally. In the future, there won’t be such a hard line between people with kids and those without – everyone will have a role in each other’s lives. We’ll create a space where having families feels more fluid, parents get the vital help they need from those w/o kids, such as empty nesters, and we’ll normalize the idea that not everyone has to have kids to play an important role with kids in the neighborhood. We can even employ the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mothers-covid-19-bailout-carecorps_n_5efccc22c5b612083c560618">bold idea of a CareCorps to make this happen</a>.</p><p><strong>12. Access to the best education will be available to all.</strong><br>The differences in opportunities in public/private systems will no longer be so stark. The best education won’t just be for those who can afford expensive private lessons and can drive kids everywhere. The best lessons with the best teachers, from math to art to piano to coding, will be available from your home and for all families, from dedicated, immersive screens.</p></div><p>Building the future of families is a complicated thing, interconnected and messy. But there is no going back.</p></div>]]>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/em_wave.png">
    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>

<p><em>A mini-series about bringing joy back to Python</em></p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I’ve been writing Python for about eight years.</p>

<p>When you come from Java, Python is magic. You can get so much done in so little code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Java be like</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span>
    <span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Python be like
</span><span>', '</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>([</span><span>f"last: </span><span>{</span><span>x</span><span>[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]:.</span><span>2</span><span>f</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
          <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>d</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>()])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I think I was too confused as an undergrad to really appreciate Python.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> But at some point, I looked back at Java and just—yikes! So much typing to <em>do</em> anything.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-discovers-python">The world discovers Python</h2>
<p>Machine learning runs on Python.</p>

<p>Matlab and Julia were fighting the good fight back in 2012, and it sort of looked like anybody’s ball game. Back then, I picked numpy. Once deep learning exploded, the heavy hitters Tensorflow and Pytorch both chose Python as their interface.</p>

<p>And since then, it’s Python, all the way down. Absolute globs, scads, and mountains of Python.</p>

<p>I write this only to tell you why I still use Python—because it’s the only first-class citizen in machine learning.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="i-discover-typescript">I discover TypeScript</h2>
<p>During 2017 and 2018, I spent my free time writing TypeScript for a little game called <a href="https://maxwellforbes.com/posts/fallgate">Fallgate</a>. TypeScript is based on JavaScript, which everyone loves to hate, and so I was prepared to hate TypeScript.</p>

<p>But then the funniest thing happened. I actually had a really great time writing TypeScript.</p>

<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The Elephant in the Room</h2>
<p>Yes, I was making a game with TypeScript, and attempting to do natural language processing (NLP) research with Python.</p>

<p>And yes, game programming, in my opinion, is a much more fun genre of <em>programming</em> than natural language processing.</p>

<p>Game programming has a stimulating feedback loop. When I built a new system for animation, lighting, particles, or movement, I’d immediately <em>see</em> the effects of the new feature. Plus, the actual code I wrote was interesting. The game programming centered around making real-time systems that efficiently managed interlocking behaviors for thousands of little game world entities. I got to try out new design patterns and play around in geometry, physics, and graphics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, programming for NLP research, I spend most of my time pushing big sludge piles of text data around. I scrape, annotate, clean, format, chunk, and batch text. I pour through text and find mountains of badly encoded files, non-linguistic junk like HTML, and of course, scads of idiots’ Internet blatherings—like this blog post! From a purely time-based perspective, I spend shockingly few hours actually building those cool neural network models everyone is excited about. And when I do, the models themselves were only a few dozen lines of code.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

</p>



<p>But aside from the (admittedly large) difference in <em>what</em> I was doing, there was a qualitative difference in the feel of the activity of programming.</p>

<h2 id="joy">Joy</h2>
<p>Programming in TypeScript brought me joy. It was easy. I felt like I always had a better handle on what options were available to me. I also felt more confidence about what was going to happen when my code ran.</p>

<p>Only through this contrast of using both languages in the same day did I realize how little joy I got from Python.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Why does it matter if Python sparks joy? When I first chose this headline, I thought it was funny. Now that I’m actually writing this, I’m becoming convinced it might be quite serious. We pour hundreds of the precious hours of our only life into our work. Seeking joy in the day to day, minute-to-minute experience of programming might be one of the more important things we can do.</p>

<p>What follows is a few posts in which I share my attempts to spark joy of Python back into my life. The first one is about static typing. I think it is the most important factor.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h3>
<p><strong>Familiarity</strong> — I’m assuming in these posts you’re moderately familiar with writing Python code. For example, I assume you understand kinds of stuff like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why people dislike <code>from &lt;name&gt; import *&nbsp;</code></li>
  <li>What if <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code> does</li>
  <li>That list comprehensions are idiomatic</li>
  <li>What <code>virutalenv</code>s are and why people use them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unfamiliarity</strong> — I’m also assuming you’re not a Python expert. Maybe you’re someone who picked it up as your first or second language in the last year or two. If you know too much, you will probably think that what I write is obvious, wrong, or both.</p>

<p><strong>Solo coding</strong> — I realized after almost finishing a draft that some of these practices are geared towards effectively programming by yourself.</p>

<p>How much discipline is necessary in solo coding? I found that after I stopped working for Google, I over-engineered most things I wrote, because I thought that writing production code for a company was “good practice” in general, and that I would be a more effective grad student if I wrote the same kind of code for my research. Many grad students (at least stereotypically) swing far on the other side of the spectrum: writing super hacky, unreadable code that barely works through a publication submission.</p>

<p>The best approach, at least for me, is probably somewhere in the middle. I realized after a few years that speed of creation in research code trumps industrial robustness,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> but there were still a few habits that would minimize my own burden down the road.</p>

    <p>I recently became aware of Jeff Bezosâ€™s dotcom-era policy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730231457/https://blog.hirevue.com/sales/what-i-learned-from-jeff-bezos-about-sales-management">banning PowerPoint</a> within Amazon. Instead, meeting organizers must write a multi-page â€œnarrativeâ€� and distribute it to all attendees at the start of the meeting - denying any single person a head start - and only after everyone has finished reading do proceedings begin.</p>

<p>This policy is particularly notable as it finds itself embedded in a company staffed largely by software engineers, who often have neither experience nor interest in writing prose. We feel most at home when transmitting ideas as algorithms, unambiguously described by mathematics and sequences of instructions. And the further we stray from this the more discontent we feel as the ambiguities of natural language leak through, needlessly eroding clarity.</p>

<p>But on closer examination I believe this is neither about powerpoint nor about reading - itâ€™s about thinking. To see why we need to look beyond the headline.</p>

<p>If we could peer into Jeffâ€™s 2004-era outbox we would find his original email:</p>

<div><p>
From: Bezos, Jeff <br>
Sent: Wednesday, June 09, 2004 6:02PM <br>
To: [REDACTED] <br>
Subject: Re: No powerpoint presentations from now on at steam </p><p>

A little more to help with the question "why." <br>
Well structured, narrative text is what we're after rather than just text. If someone builds a list of bullet points in word, that would be just as bad as powerpoint. <br>
The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than "writing" a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what's more important than what, and how things are related. <br>
Powerpoint-style presentations somehow give permission to gloss over ideas, flatten out any sense of relative importance, and ignore the interconnectedness of ideas. </p><p>

Jeff
</p></div>

<p>The point being made is clear from the language: â€œwritingâ€� is mentioned twice but â€œreadingâ€� not at all. Itâ€™s  <em>creation</em> which is important, not <em>consumption</em>. Even if the memo was written and immediately shredded, the act of writing would not be undone and the improvement to thought and understanding would persist.</p>

<p>Still, for a company trying to be <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/working/working-amazon">Earthâ€™s most customer-centric company</a>, it is hard to shake the feeling that time would be best spent interacting with, say, <em>customers</em>, rather than crafting narratives.</p>

<p>But Amazon is far from the first to recognise the value in the writing process. Some go even further:</p>

<blockquote cite="David McCullough">Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.</blockquote>

<p>And here I think itâ€™s worth digging even further to ask - why is thinking clearly important? <em>Obviously</em> - in our context of software engineering - if you donâ€™t think clearly then any solutions you craft as an individual will be suboptimal.</p>

<p>That is undoubtedly true. But more importantly, writing a coherent and logical narrative forces your thoughts into a shape which can be easily communicated to others and used to persuade. None of us work in isolation. There is little point in having the answer if you cannot convince others of its merit.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Letâ€™s imagine a team of engineers. Having just been informed of the firm-wide mandate to migrate from in-house servers to the cloud, they must make the impactful and long-lasting decision about which technology to introduce. In an attempt to reach consensus theyâ€™ve gathered around a pizza and begin exchanging views.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes guy <em>knows</em> that only his solution leads to a future free from tedious discussions around the solved problems of authentication and service discovery. Batteries must be included. Three slices to the right another engineer brims with confidence and espouses the virtues of Nomad - single-purpose, orthogonal and composable components are the <em>bedrock</em> of well-engineered software systems. Principles must come first.</p>

<p>After an hour of discussion bouncing from feature to feature to pro to con to bug to feature, everyone has learned something new. But no one is persuaded and no consensus has emerged. Though useful for knowledge exchange, such unstructured discussions are not an efficient mechanism for reaching agreement.</p>

<p>What is needed to break the stalemate is for a single individual<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> to spin a narrative which captures the journey from business need through to practicalities of implementation, in a comprehensive, flowing and logical manner. This would be persuasive - it would instill in others the confidence that this is not just the best technology in an abstract sense, itâ€™s the right choice for <em>our problem</em>, <em>our business</em>, and <em>our people</em> at <em>this point in time</em>.</p>

<p>It would be useful for others to read this. But even if they didnâ€™t, the newfound clarity of mind of the creator would allow them to make an argument persuasive enough to break the stalemate of ideas.</p>

<p>For this particular situation - the choice of a technology - the writer will likely have thought about and touched on:</p>

<p><strong>The beginning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What were the underlying reasons for the decision to change technologies? Why is this worthwhile embarking on and what benefits will be seen?</li>
  <li>What reason do we have for investigating this particular tech as a solution? What other alternatives are worth investigating?</li>
  <li>How high are the stakes? Are we laying the foundations of the cathedral or painting the bike shed? Can we easily switch later if things arenâ€™t working out?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The middle</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the tech being suggested have a mission statement or core guiding principles? How does that tie in with our problem and philosophy?</li>
  <li>If we roll with it, whatâ€™s the end goal? When implementation is complete, what does the world look like?</li>
  <li>How might we get from where we are to where we want to be with minimal disruption? What might the transition period look like? How long, roughly?</li>
  <li>Do we have any existing in-house expertise?</li>
  <li>Are there any risks? What steps might we take to reduce them? Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown unknowns</a>?</li>
  <li>In what ways might this solution fare better than the alternative(s)?</li>
  <li>In what ways might the alternative(s) fare better than this?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The end</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Relate back to the underlying business needs and sum up with a recommendation, explaining why this the best option</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the content of the narrative would overlap substantially with a technical design document. But whereas a TDD is an end in itself, the physical output of this writing is a pleasant side-effect. What matters are the organised thoughts left in the mind of the author.</p>

<p>Having competently translated these thoughts into natural language once before, the author will have no trouble doing so again when called upon, orally and in real-time. And having considered the problem at several levels of analysis - as must be done to write well - they will, at a moments notice, be able to adapt their narrative to suit any audience, regardless of their existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike specialised tools, narratives are general. They scale. From the narrowest of technical issues up to the most fundamental question of the mission and purpose of the company as a whole, there are no problems which resist clear-thinking.</p>

        <p><b>We’ve all seen the good QA director in their natural habitat, a creature who spends their time bathing in the light of an LED monitor, or perhaps gently lapping at a local coffee stream. But have you ever witnessed a <i>great</i> one?</b></p>
<p>If you have, you can consider yourself lucky. This endangered breed of QA director, with their boundless enthusiasm and an uncanny ability to nurture the young, is difficult to spot. But if we watch carefully, we can learn from their ways. And perhaps they will share with us knowledge that can make us better QA professionals.</p>
<p>How do you recognize these cryptids in the wild? This week on QA Safari: We identify the markings of the rare superb QA director and compare them with the merely good one.</p>
<h3>A good QA director: Begins work in the testing phase<br>
A great QA director: Begins work in the requirements phase</h3>
<p>A good QA director starts the job on the first day of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-development-when-slow-and-steady-doesnt-win-the-race/">the testing phase</a> in the software development lifecycle. A great QA director? They’ve already been stalking their prey of bugs for weeks, if not months, to assure that users have a seamless experience.</p>
<p>An exceptional QA director begins their work “in the requirements phase,” says Sami Ullah, a former QA tester and current sales manager at <a href="https://www.kualitatem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kualitatem</a>. That way, “You’re making sure that the project is being built on quality principles.”</p>
<p>These principles include usability, resilience, and protecting the herd against predators.</p>
<p>A great QA director also thinks about the future. Kenny Trinh, editor of <a href="https://www.netbooknews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netbook News</a>, says, “They personally invest their own time in ensuring that future works will have better quality.” The apex QA director accomplishes this by creating their own documents or perhaps by coordinating with their superiors and training content creators.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Doesn’t plan ahead. </i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_(animal_behavior)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Easily mobbed</i></a><i> by its own prey.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Can think like a QA director</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Can also think like a user</h3>
<p>Developers design company products based on user requirements. But do users or product owners <i>really</i> know what they want? As developers can tell you, usually through bared teeth, not always.</p>
<p>While a good QA director tests software and finds errors, a great one assures these errors never happen in the first place—by studying user requirements and discovering what’s missing. A great QA director looks at efficiency of a system early in the development process, feeding back usability issues to developers before they become un-usability issues.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to computing woes. As John Moss, CEO of <a href="https://www.englishblinds.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English Blinds</a> says, “A great QA director knows how to mitigate customer pain points and head them off effectively.” This means the user will have a better experience…and so will the client.</p>
<p>A top-notch QA director can draw from <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">a deep knowledge base about the problem domain</a> yet doesn’t lose sight of the user when stuck in the technical trenches. Just as a good hunter doesn’t lose sight of its prey.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Takes user requirements at face value, and that face has razor-sharp teeth.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Follows existing process to the letter</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Spots the flaws in company process</h3>
<p>Existing processes are there for a reason: They worked before, whether it’s for testing software or for using a mating call to attract a partner. But as even the animal kingdom knows, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Apply previous processes to your current testing case, and you may find your software has flaws and that you missed the window on mating season.</p>
<p>A good QA director follows standard operating procedures, but a great QA director’s operating procedures aren’t one-size-fits-all. According to Alex Kehoe, co-founder and operations director of web development firm <a href="https://caveni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caveni.com</a>, “A great QA director is someone who can spot the failings of current processes and facilitate the creation of new ones that are able to fix those shortcomings.”</p>
<p>If your team is missing obvious bugs, it’s time to look beyond the expected.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Misses bugs in favor of fine-tuning their mating call.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Takes charge</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Knows when to pass the reins to their team</h3>
<p>Just as two difference species can cooperate in the wild, a great QA director cooperates with their underlings. “Being a QA director requires trust in your team and confidence that they can complete projects and tasks without micromanaging,”&nbsp;says Sarah Franklin, co-founder of marketing firm <a href="https://bluetree.ai/">Blue Tree AI</a>.</p>
<p>This advice applies to most IT professions, but deserves special mention when it comes to QA directors: Micromanaging is a time-sucking process, and if QA doesn’t adhere to tight deadlines, they are culled from the herd.</p>
<p>The best QA directors teach newer team members and provide useful assistance. The wisdom they impart might include <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">how to design tests for mobile devices</a>, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-deliver-a-technical-presentation-to-a-non-technical-audience/">how to prepare reports for management consumption</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaner_fish#Salmonid_aquaculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to nibble on parasitic sea lice</a>.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Pushes young competitors out of the herd.</i></p>
<h3>A good QA director: Knows every inch of their tools</h3>
<h3>A great QA director: Constantly improves their skill set</h3>
<p>As with every species on Earth, technology is constantly evolving. The tools a QA professional uses to test today aren’t the same tools they used five years ago. Logically, the tools a QA tester uses won’t be the same five years from now.</p>
<p>A good QA director may know their current tools and can troubleshoot for their team. A great QA director, however, can see the latest developments in testing software on the horizon. They’re even aware of the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence, with its tricky-to-validate results.</p>
<p>As Ullah says, the best QA directors “keep on improving their skill set.”</p>
<p>So when your company begins a complex new project, the best QA director will be there, ready to implement testing tools that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">they already researched, explored, priced out</a>. Who knows? Maybe they’re so skilled, they’ll eve discover fire.</p>
<p><i>The worst QA director: Fails to evolve. Joins the passenger pigeon and the dodo as a footnote in natural history.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>What does it take to develop top-notch QA management skills? Perhaps your company needs a <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Chief Quality Officer</a>.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
			<p>Dashboard gives a graphical interface to visualize the key indicators and trends of your data. However, Creating Dashboard is always been a tedious task for developers</p>

<p>They have to wear a Front-end Dev hat for creating a Web Dashboard. Switching gears from python to Javscript/HTML is not what all developers prefer to do.</p>

<p>There are libraries like Plotly Dash, Bokeh in Python which let you generate a dashboard using python and even some people convert a Jupyter notebook into a dashboard</p>

<p>Somehow I didn’t find all these options really an easy available options to create a dashboard in Python so my Search for easy to use and a user friendly Library in pure python continues and Finally I found something much easier way to do that.</p>

<p>Yes, Streamlit which is recently gaining popularity in the Machine Learning and Data science world is a super easy library which is around to develop a dashboard in almost no time</p>

<p>The good part is that it comes with an in-built web server too and can be easily deployed inside a docker container.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will build a dashboard using COVID19 US Data. Here is the snapshot of the dashboard that you will see at the end of the tutorial</p>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/pydash_01.gif" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="collect-data-from-wikipedia">Collect data from Wikipedia</h2>

<p>We will use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States">wikipedia data</a> for this dashboard. Following are the two sets of data that you can download:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Last 15 days data of Covid-19 Cases in the United States data from 19th June 2020 to 7th July 2020 at the time of writing this article</li>
  <li>COVID-19 pandemic in the United States <strong>by state and territory</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We will download both these data in two csv files and rename as usa_covid_data_states.csv and usa_total_cases.csv</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>​	usa_covid_data_states.csv</p>

    <p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-07.png" alt=""></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>​    usa_total_cases.csv</p>

    <p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-08.png" alt=""></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="installing-streamlit-and-creating-dashboard">Installing Streamlit and Creating Dashboard</h2>

<p>Streamlit can be installed using pip:</p>



<p>Now to start creating a dashboard let’s first create a simple python file main.py and import streamlit and add the Heading and paragraph at the dashboard start</p>

<p>We will also import pandas for reading the above two csv files created using the wikipedia data</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>streamlit</span> <span>as</span> <span>st</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="load-the-two-files-in-the-dataframe">Load the two files in the dataframe</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><span>csv_file_state</span> <span>=</span> <span>'usa_covid_data.csv'</span>
<span>csv_file_total_cases</span> <span>=</span> <span>'usa_total_cases.csv'</span>
<span>df</span><span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>csv_file_total_cases</span><span>,</span><span>parse_dates</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'Date'</span><span>])</span>
<span>dfstate</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>csv_file_state</span><span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="title-and-markdowns">Title and Markdowns</h3>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-02.png" alt="image-20200704143234887"></p>

<p>Streamlit has a number of ways to add text to your app. Let’s add a title out to Dashboard. We will also use markdown to add subtext or small paragraphs and write ups in our dashboard</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"Covid19 USA Data from Wikipedia"</span><span>)</span>
<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span>
<span>"""
This app is for visualizing the Covid19 data for USA which is collected 
from the wikipedia site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States.        
User can select the Metrics Type from the drop-down list to see the trend in last 15 days
"""</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dropdowns-in-streamlit">Dropdowns in Streamlit</h3>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-03.png" alt="image-20200704143256090"></p>

<p>We will add a dropdown for user to select the following trend and plot</p>

<ol>
  <li>Total Cases</li>
  <li>Deaths</li>
  <li>Recoveries</li>
</ol>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html#streamlit.selectbox"><code>st.selectbox</code></a> to choose from a series. You can write in the options you want, or pass through an array or data frame column.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"## "</span> <span>+</span> <span>'TotalCases/Deaths/Recoveries Trend'</span><span>)</span>	
<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>markdown</span><span>(</span><span>"#### "</span> <span>+</span><span>"What Trends would you like to see?"</span><span>)</span>

<span>selected_metrics</span> <span>=</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>selectbox</span><span>(</span>
    <span>label</span><span>=</span><span>"Choose..."</span><span>,</span> <span>options</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>'TotalCases'</span><span>,</span><span>'Deaths'</span><span>,</span><span>'Recoveries'</span><span>]</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="plot--charts-and-maps">Plot  Charts and Maps</h3>

<p>Streamlit supports several popular data charting libraries like Matplotlib, Altair, Plotly etc.</p>

<p>We will use Plotly to draw charts for our dashboard</p>

<p>So we created the dropdown above and want to display the TotalCases/Deaths/Recoveries Trend based on user selection</p>

<p>We have directly use the dataframe columns as x and y data for adding traces based on user selection and You can easily add the  chart to your app with st.plotly_chart()</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Create traces
</span><span>fig</span> <span>=</span> <span>go</span><span>.</span><span>Figure</span><span>()</span>

<span>st</span><span>.</span><span>plotly_chart</span><span>(</span><span>fig</span><span>,</span> <span>use_container_width</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-04.png" alt="image-20200704145232602"></p>

<p>Similarly you can add other charts that you wanted to draw with this data.</p>



<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-05.png" alt="image-20200704150358194"></p>

<p>Another great feature of streamlit is a sidebar that gives a more cleaner look and keeps your app central and all widgets can be moved to the left of the page. Let’s see how to create a sidebar widget and dropdown filter for state using st.sidebar</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>st</span><span>.</span><span>sidebar</span><span>.</span><span>title</span><span>(</span><span>"State-Wise Data"</span><span>)</span>
<span>State_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>st</span><span>.</span><span>sidebar</span><span>.</span><span>selectbox</span><span>(</span>
    <span>'state'</span><span>,</span>
     <span>dfstate</span><span>.</span><span>State</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have passed the state list(dfstate.state) as data for the dropdown options.</p>

<p>You can almost put all elements on the side bar like st.title(), st.markdown() etc.</p>

<h2 id="starting-server-and-open-dashboard-in-browser">Starting server and open dashboard in Browser</h2>

<p><img src="https://kanoki.org/images/2020/07/image-06.png" alt="image-20200704151922047"></p>

<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the path where main.py is located and start the streamlit web server</p>



<p>By default it will be running on port 8501. Open your browser and and hit this url <a href="http://localhost:8501/">http://localhost:8501</a> to see your dashboard in the browser</p>

<p>So with this we have completed the tutorial for creating a Covid19 US Dashboard using Streamlit. If you are looking for any customization to this dashboard then I will suggest to look at the official streamlit documentation</p>

<h2 id="deploy-streamlit-app-in-docker-container">Deploy Streamlit App in Docker Container</h2>

<p>We can also deploy the streamlit app inside a docker container. if there is any configuration related changes like changing the base url for the path then those changes can also be done in the docker file</p>

<p>Here is the Docker file which is in the same folder where main.py is located</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> python:3.7</span>

<span># exposing default port for streamlit</span>
<span>EXPOSE</span><span> 8501</span>

<span># making directory of app</span>
<span>WORKDIR</span><span> /streamlit-docker</span>

<span># copy over requirements</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt ./requirements.txt</span>

<span># installing required packages</span>
<span>RUN </span>pip3 <span>install</span> <span>-r</span> requirements.txt

<span># copying all app files to image</span>
<span>COPY</span><span> . .</span>

<span># cmd to launch app when container is run</span>
<span>CMD</span><span> streamlit run main.py</span>

<span># streamlit-specific commands for config</span>
<span>ENV</span><span> LC_ALL=C.UTF-8</span>
<span>ENV</span><span> LANG=C.UTF-8</span>
<span>RUN </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /root/.streamlit
<span>RUN </span>bash <span>-c</span> <span>'echo -e "</span><span>\
</span><span>[general]\n</span><span>\
</span><span>email = \"\"\n</span><span>\
</span><span>" &gt; /root/.streamlit/credentials.toml'</span>

<span>RUN </span>bash <span>-c</span> <span>'echo -e "</span><span>\
</span><span>[server]\n</span><span>\
</span><span>baseUrlPath = \"coviddash\"\n</span><span>\
</span><span>" &gt; /root/.streamlit/config.toml'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next Run the following command to build a docker image and run the container</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Build Docker Image</p>

    <p>docker build -t coviddash .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run Docker container</p>

    <p>docker run coviddash</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>We have seen streamlit can be used to build a beautiful and interactive dashboards and web apps, all with zero web development experience! We have seen how to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code</p>

    <p>Eventually we can run this web app without using any external webserver since it has it’s own server powered by Tornado. It is easy to deploy in docker container too.</p>

    <p>I think this is the fastest and easiest method to Visualize your Machine Learning Algorithm and create Dashbaord on the go option available right now for Python developers</p>

    <p>You can find the complete code for this tutorial in my github repo <a href="https://github.com/min2bro/streamlittuts">here</a></p>

					<p>While the .NET Core documentation and libraries do a good job of providing an easy way to get started with hosted apps (web or otherwise), it is somewhat lacking in terms of the same guidance for simple run-to-completion type console apps. You can write a simple <code>Main()</code> method and do your stuff, but how do you get the advantage of the amazing configuration and dependency injection that you get out of the box with hosted apps? Surely, you could set up all that machinery and maybe create an <code>IHostedService</code> implementation just to get going. Even then, you are still left with a hosted app that you have to deal with shutting down after your logic is done.</p>
<p>If you look behind the builder methods that come out of the box with hosted apps, you will find that there is an easy way to get the good DI and configuration stuff and keep your simple <code>Main()</code> method app simple. To that end, I've written up a little <code>ProgramRunner</code> class that you can plop in and use as so (example .NET Core 3.1 code follows):</p>
<pre><code>public class ProgramOptions
{
    public string SomeOption { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    private readonly ProgramOptions _programOptions;

    public Program(IOptions&lt;ProgramOptions&gt; programOptions) =&gt; _programOptions = programOptions.Value;

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ProgramRunner
            .WithConfiguration(c =&gt; c.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json"))
            .AndServices((s, c) =&gt; s
                .Configure&lt;ProgramOptions&gt;(o =&gt; c.Bind(o))
                .AddSingleton&lt;Program&gt;())
            .Run(p =&gt; p.GetService&lt;Program&gt;().Run());
    }

    public void Run() =&gt; Console.WriteLine(_programOptions.SomeOption);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Here is the code for <code>ProgramRunner</code> referenced above (perhaps I will put it into a library at some point):</p>
<pre><code>public class ProgramRunner
{
    private Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; _configurationBuilderAction;
    private Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; _serviceCollectionAction;

    private ProgramRunner() { }

    public ProgramRunner AndConfiguration(Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; configurationBuilderAction)
    {
        _configurationBuilderAction = configurationBuilderAction;
        return this;
    }

    public ProgramRunner AndServices(Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; serviceCollectionAction)
    {
        _serviceCollectionAction = serviceCollectionAction;
        return this;
    }

    public static ProgramRunner WithConfiguration(Action&lt;IConfigurationBuilder&gt; configurationBuilderAction) =&gt; new ProgramRunner().AndConfiguration(configurationBuilderAction);
    public static ProgramRunner WithServices(Action&lt;IServiceCollection, IConfiguration&gt; serviceCollectionAction) =&gt; new ProgramRunner().AndServices(serviceCollectionAction);

    private IServiceProvider GetServiceProvider()
    {
        var configurationBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
        _configurationBuilderAction?.Invoke(configurationBuilder);
        
        var configuration = configurationBuilder.Build();

        var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection();
        _serviceCollectionAction?.Invoke(serviceCollection, configuration);
        
        return serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();
    }

    public void Run(Action&lt;IServiceProvider&gt; runAction) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider());
    
    public T Run&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, T&gt; runAction) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider());
    
    public Task RunAsync(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, CancellationToken, Task&gt; runAction, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider(), cancellationToken);
    
    public Task&lt;T&gt; RunAsync&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IServiceProvider, CancellationToken, Task&lt;T&gt;&gt; runAction, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) =&gt; runAction(GetServiceProvider(), cancellationToken);
</code></pre>
<p>And there you have it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <h2>My computer</h2>
    <p>
        I use a Thinkpad T400s computer, which has a free
        initialization program (libreboot) and a free operating system
        (Trisquel GNU/Linux). It was not sold that way by Lenovo,
        however; small businesses buy them used, recondition them, and
        install the free software.  This is one of the
        computers <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/">
        endorsed by the FSF</a>.

    </p><p>
        Before using such Thinkpads, I used the Lemote Yeeloong for
        several years.  At the time, it was the only laptop one could
        buy that could run a free initialization program and a free
        operating system.  But it was never sold with a free operating
        system.

    </p><p>
        Before that, I used an OLPC for some weeks.  The OLPC uses
        a nonfree firmware blob for the WiFi, so I could not use the internal
        WiFi device.  No big problem, I used an external WiFi adaptor.<br>
        I stopped using it because the OLPC project decided to make their
        machine support Windows, so I did not want to appear to endorse it
        by visibly carrying it around.  I could have continued using it
        privately with its free software installation, but I had no need
        for another computer to use only privately.

    </p><p>
        The results that seemed likely, millions of children running Windows
        on the OLPC, have not occurred.  Instead we see millions of children
        running Windows on the Intel Classmate, or nowadays a Chromebook
	that sends the child's personal data to Google.

    </p><p>
        Before that I used machines that ran completely free GNU/Linux
        systems but had nonfree BIOSes.  I tried for about 8 years to find a
        way to avoid the nonfree BIOS in some commercial machine.



    </p><h2>GNU/Linux distro</h2>
    <p>
        I do not have a preferred GNU/Linux distro.  I recommend all the
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/distros">ethical distros</a> —
        namely, those that are 100% free software.

    </p><p>
        I've chosen not to have any preferences among those ethical distros.
        In fact, I am not in a position to judge them on other criteria:
        even to try them all would be a lot work of that I have no need to do.



    </p><h2>What I do on my computer</h2>
    <p>
        Mostly I use a text console, for convenience's sake.  Most of
        my work is editing text and that is more efficient on a text
        console. On the text console, the touchpad can't cause me any
        trouble if I touch it by accident.

    </p><p>
        I do use X11 for tasks that need a graphical interface.
        I have no preferred graphical environment or window manager.
        Since my interest in using graphical environments is small,
        I don't want to spend time comparing them.

    </p><p>
        This is not an ethical issue, just my own personal preference.  On
        the ethical level, I think it is important for free software to
        provide convenient free graphical user interface software, which is
        why the GNU Project launched three projects to develop that.  The
        third, <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, was successful, so we
        never needed a fourth one.

    </p><p>
        I spend most of my time editing in Emacs.  I read and send mail with
        Emacs using M-x rmail and C-x m.  I have no experience with any
        other email client programs.  In principle I would be glad to know
        about other free email clients, but learning about them is not a
        priority for me and I don't have time.

    </p><p>
        I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer
        helpers install the political notes and urgent notes.
        I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites.
        In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning
        about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.



    </p><h2>How this site is maintained</h2>
    <p>
        This site is maintained in a very simple way.  I edit the pages such
        as this one manually as HTML.  I only know simple HTML; others who
        know more wrote the parts at the top and bottom of pages, and the
        more complex formatting on the home page.  Volunteer helpers install
        the political notes every day after receiving the text from me by
        email.  A cron job "rolls over" the political notes page every two
        months.  The photo galleries are generated with <a href="http://www.netpurgatory.com/downloads.html#thumbnail">this
        perl script</a>.  The search feature on the site is done with
        <a href="https://stallman.org/site-search/StallmanOrgSearch.tar.gz">this code</a>.

    </p><p>
        An <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">
        explanation of the concept of designing</a> a "user experience"
        which also shows why I find it loathsome.
        This is why I want stallman.org to remain simple: not a "user
        experience" but rather a place where I present certain information,
        views and action opportunities to you.

    </p><p>
        Would you like to help do this?  Write to rms at the site gnu.org.



    </p><h2>How I use the Internet</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                I have used the Internet since it first existed.
                I never used UUCP, though occasionally I sent emails to
                addresses that involved transmission via UUCP.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div><p>
                I am careful in how I connect to the internet.
                </p><p>
                Specifically, I refuse to connect through portals that would
                require me to identify myself, or to run any nontrivial
                <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
                Javascript code</a>.  I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> to prevent nonfree Javascript code from running..

	    </p></div><p>
	        I don't mind giving an identity that isn't
                really me, in order to connect, if that works.

            </p><p>
                I often connect in a person's home.  The <em>person</em>
                of course knows who I am, but that does not bother me.  What I
                would object to is putting my identity in a database that can be
                searched.  I prevent that by changing my mac address at each
                location.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <div>
                <p><a name="internetuse">I am careful in how I use the Internet</a>.
                </p><p>
                I generally do not connect to web sites from my own machine,
                aside from a few sites I have some special relationship with.
                I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
                program (see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/womb/hacks.git)
                that fetches them, much like wget, and then mails them back to
                me.  Then I look at them using a web browser, unless it is easy
                to see the text in the HTML page directly.  I usually try lynx
                first, then a graphical browser if the page needs it
                (using konqueror, which won't fetch from other sites in such a
                situation).

            </p></div><p>
                I occasionally also browse unrelated sites using IceCat via Tor.
                Except for rare cases, I do not identify myself to them. I think
                that is enough to prevent my browsing from being connected with
                me. IceCat blocks tracking tags and most fingerprinting methods.

            </p><p>
                I never pay for anything on the Web, because I cannot
		pay anonymously.  Anything on the net that requires
		payment that would identify me, I don't do.  (I made
		an exception for the fees for the stallman.org domain,
		since that is connected with me anyway.)

	    </p><p>
	        I avoid
		paying with <a href="https://stallman.org/rms-lifestyle.html#cards">
		credit cards</a> generally.  For freedom's sake, insist on
		paying cash.  When a business pressures you to pay in
		an identified way, it's your chance to defend freedom by
		saying, "If you won't take my cash, no sale!"

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                I would not mind paying for a copy of <a href="https://stallman.org/ebooks.pdf">an
                e-book</a> or <a href="https://stallman.org/internet-music.html">music recording</a>
                on the Internet if I could do so anonymously, and it treated me
		justly in other ways (no DRM or EULA).  But that option almost
                never exists. I keep looking for ways to make it exist.

        </p></li>
        <li>
            <p>
                For searching, I have mostly used DuckDuckGo for the past
                few years.  It does work with JS disabled, but you have
                to follow a link before you search.

            </p><p>
                I also sometimes use ixquick.com.  My usual
                precautions should stop them from knowing it is me.

            </p><p>
                I no longer use Google search, not even occasionally, because
                it sends me a broken CAPTCHA.  I suspect the reason it tries to
                send me a CAPTCHA is that I am coming through Tor.
                I would answer the CAPTCHA if that worked, but it does not.

            </p><p>
                I suspect that the reason the CAPTCHA is broken is that it
                depends on nonfree Javascript.  I won't run that in my computer.
                I am not willing to let Google see where I am, so I won't bypass
                Tor. Therefore, I can't use Google search any more.

        </p></li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Social media</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a name="social-networking">I do not use any social networking
                sites</a> because that way of working is inconvenient for me.
                That doesn't mean I think they are all unethical.  Some are,
                some are not. Social networking sites raise their own set of
                ethical issues, completely different from the ethical issues of
                distributing software (<a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
                free vs proprietary</a>), and there are big differences between
                them.

            </p><p>
                <a name="twitter">I have a Twitter account</a> called
                rmspostcomments, which I use to log in on other sites to post
                comments on articles. I never post on Twitter.  Someone made an
                account stallman_feed which I'm told posts something about my
                political notes. Any other Twitter account that claims to be
                mine is an impostor.

                    <h3 id="geo-spatial-correlation">Geo-Spatial Correlation</h3><p>Geo-spatial autocorrelation refers to the degree to which one object is similar to other nearby objects. “Auto” means self and “correlation” means association. In layman terms, it measures how close objects are similar to other close objects.</p><blockquote>The first rule of GIS: Everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things (Waldo R. Tobler , 1970)</blockquote><h4 id="to-understand-this-law-let-s-take-an-example-">To understand this law, let’s take an example.</h4><p>Suppose you randomly picked up a house from a listing website like <a href="https://housing.com/" rel="noopener">Housing</a> and let's assume that the price of the house is $600K. Next, let's say the house just next to it is also listed for sale and you are to predict it’s the price. You are given two options $650K and $2.8M, which one would you pick?</p><p>If you picked $600K, then you already subconsciously know what spatial autocorrelation is. It is the correlation between two nearby objects in some common features (<em>for example house prices</em>).</p><p>A potential application of spatial auto-correlation is that it helps in analyzing clusters and dispersion of ecology and diseases. Questions such as “<em>Is the disease an isolated case</em>” or “<em>Is the rainfall pattern clustered or same across places</em>” can be well understood and answered with spatial autocorrelation analysis.</p><hr><h3 id="technical-definition">Technical Definition</h3><p>Technically, spatial auto-correlation refers to the measure of association between observation of variables that are close to each other at a spatial scale. The variable could be:</p><p>1. at any point on a continuous surface (such as land-use type or annual precipitation level in a region)</p><p>2. at a set of fixed sites in a particular region (such as a set of retail outlets)</p><p>3. &nbsp;across a set of areas that subdivide a region (such as count or proportion of the household which have two or more cars in a Census data that divide an urban region).</p><p>Autocorrelation violates the core principles of statistics, that is, observations are independent of each other. As per assumptions of independence in classical statistics , <em>observations between groups </em>and <em>observation within groups</em> should be independent . Hence , spatial autocorrelation clearly violates the above mentioned assumptions .</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/0_b489Z6tejMkolJ2W.jpg"><figcaption>Photo by Patrick Assalé on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="photo-source noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>The concept of spatial correlation is a kind of extension of temporal correlation. The only difference being that temporal correlation measures the change of a variable over time while spatial correlation measures the change of two variables — observation (values like income, rainfall, etc) and location.</blockquote><h3 id="types-of-spatial-correlation">Types of Spatial Correlation</h3><p>The most common forms of spatial correlation across geospatial space are patches and gradients.</p><p>Spatial correlation in a variable can be <em>exogenous</em> (caused by another spatially auto-correlated variable like rainfall) or <em>endogenous</em> (caused by some process at play like the spread of a disease).</p><p>Here’s a video which talks in detail about how spatial autocorrelation helps in the importance<strong> </strong>of spatial autocorrelation.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-emjdYiOQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-emjdYiOQw">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="moran-s-i"><strong>Moran’s I</strong></h3><p>Spatial auto-correlation is measured by Moran’s I. Moran’s I is a correlation coefficient used to measure the overall spatial correlation in your data set. &nbsp;Moran I’s can be classified as positive, negative and no spatial autocorrelation:</p><h4 id="1-positive-correlation-"><strong>1. Positive correlation</strong>:</h4><p>Spatial correlation is positive when similar values cluster together on a map. Positive autocorrelation occurs when Moran I is close to +1. The image below shows the land cover in an area and it is an example of a positive correlation since similar clusters are nearby.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_lK9g67hwjqppv4Ko8JoXoQ.png"><figcaption>Land cover image depicting the positive correlation</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2-negative-correlation-">2. <strong>Negative correlation</strong>:</h4><p>Spatial correlation is negative when dissimilar values cluster together on a map. A negative spatial autocorrelation occurs when Moran’s I value is -1. A checkerboard is a good example of negative auto-correlation because dissimilar values are next to each other.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/03/1_DXBMydyxEuTDLO-lRSi3CQ.png"><figcaption>Dissimilar objects cluster together hence the negative correlation</figcaption></figure><h4 id="2-zero-correlation-">2. Zero correlation:</h4><p>A Moran’s I value of 0 denotes no spatial autocorrelation.</p><h3 id="applications-of-spatial-correlation">Applications of Spatial Correlation</h3><p>The importance of spatial autocorrelation is that it helps to define how important spatial characteristic is in affecting a given object in space and if there is a clear relationship of objects with spatial properties. Here are some of the interesting industrial use cases of spatial autocorrelation:</p><ol><li><strong>Measure of Inequality: </strong>Spatial autocorrelation helps find out the measure of inequality and diversity be it in terms of income, population or race.

If I take a jug of water and pour water into this glass, I'm <em>depositing </em>water into it. After I've done that, I might say there is a 'water deposit' in the glass.</p><p>Admittedly we don't often use that phrase to talk about water, but think for example of a geological metal deposit: in the beginning of the earth asteroids crashed and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101209-asteroid-collisions-earth-gold-science-space/">'deposited' debris</a> all over the planet, while volcanos 'deposited' lava, which nowadays leads us to discover 'cobalt deposits', ‘gold deposits’ or ‘iron ore deposits’.</p><p>Notice that the verb ‘deposit’ creates a <em>noun</em> of the same name: the exploding volcano 'deposits iron deposits', or the jug 'deposits a water deposit' into the glass.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->




<!--End mc_embed_signup--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following this linguistic convention, then, we are prone to thinking that we 'deposit a bank deposit'. Surely - much like the water we have poured into the glass - 'bank deposit' refers to money we have 'poured into’ the bank. Indeed, that's what reputable sources like the Merriam-Webster Dictionary say: according to them, a bank 'deposit' is 'money deposited in a bank'.</p><p>But they are totally wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-2.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>(Note: This is a composite website screenshot that has been edited for simplicity)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="unhitch-the-linguistic-glitch">Unhitch the Linguistic Glitch</h3><p>To understand 'bank deposits' you need to unhitch the verb from the noun. Let's illustrate this through the metaphor of a glass with water. If we imagine that the glass is the bank, the traditional mythology is that I pour (deposit) water (money) into it, after which the bank is 'storing' this 'deposit' for me. This is the mistake. The bank does not store my water for me. Rather they <em>take ownership</em> of my water - it is no longer mine - after which they issue me a promise for it. Imagine them taking out a piece of paper and writing ‘I owe you 100ml of water’. They hand it to me, <em>issuing </em>it out.</p><p>This promise they hand out to me is my 'deposit'.</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Water-Deposit.png 1033w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A 'water deposit'</figcaption></figure><p>So, as a <em>noun</em>, 'bank deposits' are not the 'thing put into banks'. They are the <em>thing issued out </em>by banks.</p><p>I illustrate this in <a href="https://youtu.be/mmWOO7r_NMw?t=654">this Youtube video</a> by asking the viewer to imagine going into a casino with cash: you approach the cashier and hand the cash over in order to get <em>casino chips</em>. Those chips are a form of private currency that only works internal to the casino, and are <em>issued out</em> by the casino in response to <em>money put in</em>. Banks, similarly, <em>issue out </em>digital chips when we <em>put in </em>money. Those digital chips are the units we see 'in our bank account', but really our 'bank account' is just a record of what the bank has <em>issued out </em>to us. These outwardly-orientated digital chips are then called 'bank deposits' (or - sometimes - 'bank money', or M1), in contrast to the state money (or 'reserves', or M0), that gets 'put in'. </p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s77uGv4ezTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>This article can also also be seen in YouTube form!</figcaption></figure><p>Confusingly, both the <em>thing put in</em>, and the <em>thing issued out</em> are called 'money' - if I 'pay by cash' I'm using state money, but if I '<a href="https://youtu.be/aem0rvvPKMQ">pay by card</a>' I'm using bank money, but in both scenarios I'll coloquially say 'I used money to pay'. To return to our water metaphor, this is like calling both water and a promise for water, 'water'). The accurate way to refer to 'paying by card' is to say 'paying by bank deposit transfer', which is the banking equivalent of using a casino chips to pay for something.</p><h3 id="promises-for-the-treasure-chest">Promises for the treasure chest</h3><p>I do not know the etymology of the noun 'bank deposit', but I'm guessing the confusion it creates emerges from a shortening of a term like 'deposit slip'. Imagine the following diary entry, perhaps coming from a 19th century merchant trying out a bank for the first time: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"Today I deposited all my state money into Barclays bank. The clerk issued me a deposit receipt, recognising that I had handed over ownership of my money to them, but promising me that I could come reclaim it. This slip - with its promise - is now my money."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Nowadays these 'deposit receipts' are digital chips, and the 'receipt' part has been dropped, shortening the term to 'deposit'. This slippage has caused the verb and noun to diverge from their traditional English-language pairing, but the 'outward-facing receipt' nature of deposits is easily confirmed by looking at a bank balance sheet. Here's one from Barclays:</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Deposit-Balance-Sheet-2-1.png 1131w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If deposits were ‘in’ the bank, they would be in the <em>assets</em> section on top. The assets section is like a record of the bank's ‘treasure chest’, with the things it <em>owns</em>. Notice, however, that 'deposits' are actually located in the <em>liabilities </em>section of the balance sheet, which records the promises that the bank has made (against the backdrop of the things it has in its 'treasure chest'), such as ‘we promise to pay you bondholders in two years’, or ‘we promise you state money on demand’. This latter promise is the ‘deposits’, and they are not ‘inside the glass’, because the glass is in the assets section.</p><h3 id="dispelling-the-deposit-myth-from-fractional-reserve-">Dispelling the deposit myth from 'fractional reserve'</h3><p>But it gets better. Do you notice that 'deposits' on the liabilities side of Barclays balance sheet far exceed the 'cash and balances at central bank' category in their assets section? In our water metaphor, this means 'the promises for water we've issued out far exceeds the water in our glass'.</p><p>This is a result of what is sometimes called 'fractional reserve banking' (albeit I use the term 'credit creation of money')</p><p>Fractional reserve banking is a favourite bogeyman for bank critics to attack, but it's frequently misrepresented due to our misunderstanding about the nature of deposits. Let me explain.</p><p>If you start from the assumption that a deposit is a ‘thing inside the bank’, rather than a ‘thing issued out by the bank’, you will be prone to explaining fractional reserve banking as follows: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>‘I deposit money into the bank, but they then secretly give it away to someone else whilst telling you it is still there’</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If this is you, you've made an error, and have fallen into the trap of thinking that banks 'lend out the water that I've put inside them'. This also means you've failed to make a distinction between the two forms of money in our society: state money ('water'), and bank money ('promise for water'). And both of these misunderstandings are facilitated by the linguistic glitch we are trying to deprogram. </p><p>To accurately rewire your understanding, you must start from the recognition that your money ('bank deposits') is <em>issued out</em> by banks. The bank issues out promises for water in the glass, <em>but</em> - and this is crucial - they can issue out many more promises for water than they actually have. There is no process of them 'sneaking away water to give to someone else'. They don't touch the water. All they do is increase the number of promises they issue for it. Given that these bank promises are called deposits, it follows that deposits can be issued - and thereby expand - even if nothing was ‘deposited’. </p><p>But why would banks do that? Well, because they issue these short-term promises to extract more valuable long-term promises from the people they issue the short-term promises to. Those long-term promises end up in the assets section of the balance sheet, in that section called 'loans'. Yes, a loan is not 'water from the bank'. It is 'short-term promises for water from the bank, in exchange for long-term promises for water from you'.</p><p>Yes, banks can create assets by issuing liabilities, which is a more complex topic for another article, but if I had to adapt the water metaphor, I'd say something like <em>'when banks issue out excess promises for water in the glass, they conjur into being a portfolio of ghostly ice-statues that will attract melt-water towards the glass'...</em></p><p>That metaphor probably needs some work, but it's a good place to start.</p><h3 id="update-the-dictionary">Update the dictionary</h3><p>The verb-noun glitch creates all manner of weird anomalies when you start to play with it. For example, if I do indeed insist on 'depositing a bank deposit' it will in fact disappear, because - using our rewired understandings of those terms - that would actually mean 'handing back to the bank its own promises'. Incidentally, this is actually what happens when you 'repay a loan'. You are literally destroying bank money.</p><p>If that is too complex, don't worry. I'll make more articles and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/brettscott">money mythbusting videos</a> about this, with new metaphors.</p><p>I'll close, finally, with a suggestion for you Merriam-Webster, because I'm guessing you haven't updated this since 1828...</p><figure><img src="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1000w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1600w, https://alteredstatesof.money/content/images/2020/07/Bank-Deposit-3.png 1749w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>In order to avoid the time-consuming job of dealing with the spambots and fraudsters who troll comments sections, I've decided to try something different.

How else would I transfer code of Stack Overflow into my editor? But seriously, I copy &amp; paste like a mad man and tend to pile up a ton of notes.</p><h2>💾 Do you want to save the changes to the following 39 files?</h2><p>While working on a project this quickly gets out of hand when I have tons of <code>Untitled-39</code> tabs open filled with code snippets, CLI commands, terminal traces, things I don't want to forget, which are visually indistinguishable from one another and aren’t particularly easy to find among the other 15 version-tracked files open. I don’t really want to save these things in the project, and if I put them on my desktop they wind up getting shuffled into a folder or, most likely, the trash.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/3/headline.png"></p><p>The next time I'm picking up a project again I often find myself looking through google results for visited Stack Overflow pages, or browsing through old projects to see if I can find that one example I sort of remember. To make matters worse for myself, I prefer to run a single workspace per project, or just pull up individual folders in VS Code my search quickly expands to all of my file system. This problem is why we have designed the Scratchpad in Marquee. A smart inter-workspace clipboard to keep track of your valuable notes.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">Install Marquee</a>, if you haven't already 🙌</p></blockquote><h2>💡 Scratchpad, a smart inter-workspace clipboard to keep track of your valuable notes.</h2><p>Conveniently you can create a new scratch snippet from two places, by clicking the scratchpad's "plus" button (top right corner of widget). Or, just make a selection in your editor, right click, and select “Add note to Marquee”.</p><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/3/scratchpad.gif"></p><p>If added form the editor, notes will automatically be added in both the Scratch widget and the tree view naming it after the file it originated from. Double-click the note in the widget to inline edit (thanks to language detection, should be nicely syntax highlighted). Super fast filtering functionality is available to quickly sift through thousands of snippets, so you can create and filter to your heart’s content.</p><h2>🏌️ My development workflow with the scratchpad</h2><p>I like to have quick access to my scratchpad and to do that, I keep Marquee's tree view open on the left next to my code. When coding, I collapse News and Todos. This way I'm not distracted unless I want to be, and can quickly insert or create notes directly into my file. The file tree is only one click away to navigate my project and the terminal at the bottom giving me quick access to yarn install etc in the repo.</p><blockquote><p>Be sure to <a href="https://marquee.activecove.com/">install Marquee</a> and test drive it for yourself 🛺</p></blockquote><p><img alt="Marquee Blog" src="https://marquee.activecove.com/blog/3/editing.gif"></p><h2>🤔 Making notes &amp; todos even more useful</h2><p>We are considering adding the ability to tag your snippets, and filter by tag and or language, the ability to jump directly back to the line in the file where the snippet came from, or add the global vs workspace scoping we currently provide for todos.</p><p>Do you like my workflow? What about yours? Tell us by clicking the feedback button in the Marquee welcome widget and let us know about what features your development workflow desires.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[How and why I attempt to use Links as main browser]]>

<p><small><em>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 21:37:19 +0200</em></small></p>

<p>Many browsers today are gigantic resource hogs, which are basically
VMs for various web applications. On the other hand, <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">Links</a> is a HTML
browser. It is not able to do everything. It allows me to avoid most
distractions and control the content-experience. The goal of this
exercise is not to force anyone to use this browser, but just to be
watchful and conscious of their hypertext based internet usage (one
might use gopher, and this phlog is available there, but probability
tells me that a person reading this reads this from hypertext source
and I am sure they are lovely).</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>I use links compiled with X11 support and with <a href="https://gist.github.com/lich-tex/4795eeccf9b4e9ae21c94a65f7527ff2">Xembed patch</a> for
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/">tabbed</a>. I execute it using <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/glinks">a script</a>, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/lich-tex/scriptsanddotfiles/blob/master/bin/dsurfraw">surfraw with
dmenu</a> to have a uniform search function and bookmarks that work with
all my browsers. That is all you need to know. Interesting trivia:
Julian Assange made surfraw. Huh.</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<p>First, I want to focus on ‘destruction’ of CSS. As Links does not
support modern CSS it renders most of the internet as-is, and will
only contain images (on which I will write later). CSS causes the
internet to become a baroque set of arbitrary design decisions, and
does not contribute positively to the general experience. Links (after
2.19) allows me to pick my own font, my own background/foreground/url
color. Thus, I have a uniform experience. In that I already visibly
save time/energy/brain processing power, etc. To deal with senselessly
complex sites (news pages with &gt;1 MB JS, I am looking at you) I use
and <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/miniwebproxy">tedu’s miniwebproxy</a>. It delimits the content even more, and
removes elements that are not of interest for me (top,bottom,side
bars, recommended content, etc.).</p>

<h2>JS</h2>

<p>JS is the main cause for the way internet changed, for better or
worse. It changed content into dissimilar applications. It allowed for
measurement of attention and penalization of the experience. I am
critical of that, and Links has no JS support. Perfect. Nothing more
to be spoken of. If I need JS I will use another browser which
emulates anything Google considers good internet experience. But, that
<em>currently</em> is not my goal.</p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p>Now, going from a little controversy to a giant controversy. Images (in the
modern web) are uninformative, but are simply advertisements of
content. They are made to take over your attention and again, make the
experience less uniform. Links does not force you to disable images
(as there are cases when they are useful - i.e. Wikipedia), but has a
function to not load them. Again, as with everything it allows for
more uniformity.</p>

<h2>Sad facts</h2>

<p>The word attempt is key here, and primarily I use it for Wikipedia
articles, directed searches (with surfraw), browsing youtube
through <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, browsing twitter through <a href="https://nitter.net/">nitter.net</a>, but sadly
majority of my usage still ends up in a Chrome-like (that includes
Firefox). But writing and thinking like this allows to see what are
the issues with the modern web and how they can be approached. Using Links
is a radical solution, but as with many <a href="https://www.rationalwalk.com/via-negativa-wisdom-through-subtraction/">via negativa</a> solutions, they
teach us what are the things that are needed for valuable UX.</p>

<h2>Should I?</h2>

<p>I think trying is great. I have not explained how to do it, cause the
task of that is manpages and other analysis to get to know your wanted
experience, and not the wanted experience of someone else. Although,
it just maybe a continuation of a liberal dream of ability to control
your own consumer experience. The reality is you never have to, as
there is no possibility of changing the entire <em>internet</em> for better,
but you might find things that you can make better. Or only not worse.
You can also try out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a>, but it is much more radical experience.</p>

            <p>If you are a Node.js developer, using npm packages won’t be a new concept to you. From complex npm packages like express to simple packages, npm hosts a large number of Node.js libraries that simplify the workload of Node developers. But have you ever thought about publishing a Node library of your own to help fellow developers? In today’s tutorial, we are going through the steps you have to follow when publishing your own Node.js library using npm.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin…</h2>
<p>Before we begin this, you should have the following things set up.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a></li>
<li>Node.js and npm installed (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Installation steps</a>)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm account</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have all of the above set up, let’s get to publishing the library.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are creating a simple library that converts a sentence to title case (in which the first letter of every word is capitalized).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="choose-a-package-name">Choose a package name</h2>

</figure>

<p>When choosing a name for the npm package, you have to check whether the name is available on the official <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm website</a>. Your package name should be unique if you are publishing it as an unscoped (public) package.</p>
<p>However, if the package is scoped, or private, the package name does not have to be unique and the name takes the format of @username/package-name. You can find out more about scoped packages <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm/scope.html#:~:text=Scoped%20packages%20can%20be%20published,registries%20at%20the%20same%20time.">here</a>.</p>
<p>The name of the package we are going to create is “title-case-converter”.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="create-a-github-repository">Create a GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Create a new repository named “title-case-converter” in GitHub. Make sure to initialize the repository with a README. Choose an appropriate license like the MIT license as well.</p>
<hr>

<p>Save your name, email, and website (if any) to npm. These details will be added to the package.json file of the project when it’s created.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm set init.author.name "&lt;your-name&gt;"
npm set init.author.email "&lt;your-email-address"&gt;
npm set init.author.url "&lt;your-website-url&gt;"
</code></pre></div><p>Then, log in to npm with the command npm login. You will be prompted to enter the credentials you used to create the npm account.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="initialize-the-project">Initialize the project</h2>
<p>Create a new directory for the project and initialize it using the <code>npm init</code> command. Make sure to fill out <strong>package-name</strong>, <strong>version</strong>, <strong>description</strong>, <strong>git repository</strong>, <strong>keywords</strong>, and <strong>license</strong> fields to add these details to the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">(base) ➜  title-case-converter npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install &lt;pkg&gt;` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

</figure>

<p>Note how we are using the version 1.0.0 for this package. This is the version we should use for the initial version of a package published to npm.</p>
<p>Npm uses a versioning system called Semantic Versioning (SemVer). The default starting version is 1.0.0. In future updates of your package, there are three types of version changes you can make following SemVer standards. These 3 are named patch, minor, and major.</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and</li>
<li>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p>
<p>You can read more about SemVer versioning <a href="https://semver.org/">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="create-the-node-module">Create the Node module</h2>
<p>Now we can implement our package, title-case-converter.</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>app.js</code> (or whichever you set as your entry point) and add the following code to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>converter</span>(<span>sentence</span>){
    <span>let</span> <span>capitalized</span> <span>=</span> []
    <span>let</span> <span>words</span> <span>=</span> <span>sentence</span>.<span>split</span>(<span>" "</span>) <span>//split the sentence into words

        <span>let</span> <span>capitalizedWord</span> <span>=</span> <span>word</span>.<span>slice</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>).<span>toUpperCase</span>() <span>+</span> <span>word</span>.<span>slice</span>(<span>1</span>) <span>//capitalize the first letter of every word
</span><span></span>        <span>capitalized</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>capitalizedWord</span>)         
    })
    <span>let</span> <span>converted</span> <span>=</span> <span>capitalized</span>.<span>join</span>(<span>" "</span>) 
    <span>return</span> <span>converted</span>
}

<span>module</span>.<span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>converter</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It contains a single function called <code>converter</code>, which accepts a string sentence and capitalizes the first letter of every word in it. The most important part of the above code is exporting the created function using <code>module.exports</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="initialize-git">Initialize Git</h2>
<p>Now, we are going to initialize git for our project using the command <code>git init</code>. Then, stage the files we changed, using the following command.</p>
<p>In the next step, commit the changes of code to the local repository.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git commit -m "initial changes"
</code></pre></div><p>After this, we have to add the GitHub repository as the project’s remote repository.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git remote add origin &lt;GitHub repository URL&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Pull the changes from the remote repository and then push the local changes to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">git pull origin master
git push origin master
</code></pre></div><hr>
<h2 id="write-a-good-readme-file-for-the-package">Write a good README file for the package</h2>
<p>Including a good README is crucial when publishing an npm package. It gives the other users the basic rundown of what your package does and how they can use it in their projects.</p>
<p>You can find a template to create a good README <a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2">here</a>. To get a better idea about how your README should look, you can browse popular npm packages and GitHub repositories to see how others have done it.</p>
<p>Generally, a README should cover the following fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small description of what your package does.</li>
<li>How another user can install the package to use it in their project.</li>
<li>How to use the package in a project. Provide code examples explaining the usage.</li>
<li>How to contribute to your package. If you expect other open-source developers to contribute to this project, this field is a must-add to the README file.</li>
<li>The license used by the package. For this package, we used the MIT license.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes don’t forget to commit and push.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="publish-the-package-to-npm">Publish the package to npm</h2>
<p>Even though the concept of publishing a library feels like a lot of work when you first hear about it, this step is surprisingly simple. All you have to do is run the following command in your command-line.</p>
<p>If you chose a package name that doesn’t clash with existing npm packages, this step should go smoothly and in a matter of seconds, your first package will be published to npm.</p>
<p>Now you can create a new Node.js project and install your new package as a dependency using this command.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm install title-case-converter --save
</code></pre></div><p>Then, you can import the package to the new project and use it to convert sentences to the title-case as you wish.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>converter</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>"title-case-converter"</span>)

<span>let</span> <span>convertedSentence</span> <span>=</span> <span>converter</span>(<span>"my name is juan"</span>) <span>//"My Name Is Juan"
</span></code></pre></div><p>That’s it! You are now a proud owner of a published npm package.</p>
<p>You can try your hand at creating a more complex Node.js module and publish it to npm after this.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you may of have expected publishing an NPM package is a simple task, and you don’t always need to follow the same steps in the same order like it was explained in this tutorial. You can assign the author, or make modifications to the package name or any other attributes later on by using npm commands or simply editing the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<p>I hope you learned something new today, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>We built Repl.it to make it easy to explore and learn languages and programming paradigms. We’ve grown a community that, like us, is <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Wildest-programming-language-idea/42923">excited</a> by languages. We were, however, surprised by how slow-moving the programming language space seems to be. Given how fast software is growing, shouldn’t we see more innovation in programming languages?</p>
<p>We can think of a programming language as either a tool built to be good at a software domain or as a medium for thought and expression. If languages are indeed tools, then some languages would be better than others for a given task. For example, if I want to build a web server with reliable performance, I might use Golang because it has a solid standard library and concurrency primitives. Whereas, if I'm making a UI, I might want to use JavaScript for its first-class support for event-driven programming. On the other hand, if we think about languages as mediums of expression, choosing a language becomes less about objective qualities and more about aesthetics and ergonomics. </p>
<p>But if languages are tools, shouldn't we see many more language variations to cover the ever-increasings niches that software is entering? Similarly, if languages are mediums of thought, and there are more and more people interested in expressing themselves digitally, shouldn't we expect to see many more types of languages?</p>
<p>One answer could be that programmers are not that interested in thinking about languages. Or that our languages today are sufficient and everyone is happy. But spend a few minutes on any programming forum, and it’ll become clear that a lack of enthusiasm and opinions on languages could not be the reason why we don’t see more programming languages.</p>
<p>Programming languages are undoubtedly hard to make. They require a combination of design skills and technical chops. But for some reason, language designers are typically solo hackers. But what if we made programming languages easier to make? If we showed that it is possible for anyone, even those with limited experience, perhaps especially beginners, can create and experiment with languages? Wouldn’t we get a lot more exciting and fresh ideas?</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/jam.png" alt="language jam"></p>
<p>Well, here at Repl.it, we specialize in making hard things accessible, and we want to make creating programming languages easier, fun, exciting, and collaborative. Today, we're announcing the programming language jam and a $10,000 grant to a team that designs and prototypes a new language with emphasis on fresh and possibly wild ideas. The winning language will also get added to Repl.it, where anyone can quickly start using it to code. We’ll have prizes for individual category winners too.</p>
<p>The hackathon starts on <strong>August 10th</strong> and runs until <strong>August 31st</strong>. To enter, you have to create a Repl.it Team when registration opens with a minimum of two team members. <strong>Registration will open on August 1st</strong>. To be notified when registration opens, leave your email <a href="https://forms.gle/x3n4cDYQzdvFvci57">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Hackathon is judged by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a> whose language experimentation spans toy Lisp interpreters to programming environments for kids</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalke">Jordan Walke</a>, the creator of React.js and the Reason programming language</li>
<li>TBD: we're looking for more judges. Specifically people who are interested in wild programming language ideas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="can-anyone-participate">Can anyone participate?</h3>
<p>Yes! You don’t even need to have any prior experience making languages. To help you get started, we created these tutorials and templates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-Python/45767">Making your own programming language with Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Making-your-own-programming-language-with-NodeJS/45779">Making your own programming language with NodeJS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here also also some links to other websites that can help you learn the basics of making your own languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md">Make a Lisp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/little-lisp-interpreter">Little Lisp Interpreter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-language-should-it-be">What kind of language should it be?</h2>
<p>Any kind -- it could be dynamic, compiled, or whatever. We’re particularly interested in fresh ideas. So the only criteria are that it’s a language you can program in :)</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-get-if-i-win">What do I get if I win?</h2>
<p>You get $5,000 upfront, and $5,000 over two months to continue working on the language after the jam. We ask you to try to get to a usable version of the language to be added to Repl.it in three months after the jam.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-code-it-on-replit">Do I have to code it on Repl.it?</h2>
<p>During the jam, we ask all participants to code and submit their projects on Repl.it to make it easy for our judges to run your project, and for our users to interact and potentially fork and remix your language. We ask that you make one demo repl that it’s easy to run and try. </p>
<p>After the jam, it’s up to you where you want to finish coding the language. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-be-a-judge">Can I be a judge?</h2>
<p>Yes -- reach out to us on Twitter or email, and we’d be happy to chat. </p>
<h2 id="can-i-remix-or-improve-on-an-existing-language">Can I remix or improve on an existing language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as you're adding original ideas and putting an effort to meaningfully change or improve the language.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-domain-specific-language-dsl">Can I make a Domain Specific Language (DSL)?</h2>
<p>Yes. As long as the DSL deviates from the host language in constructs and syntax. For example GraphQL is useful/interesting on its own despite being embedded in JavaScript</p>
<h2 id="can-i-make-a-non-turing-complete-language">Can I make a non-turing complete language?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as it's useful and not purely academic.</p>

<p>Every time you commit and push software changes, you should be building and testing it for bugs. That includes security bug testing against a live integration environment, so you can be aware of any new bugs as they are introduced, and before they go to production. Here’s a step-by-step guide to accomplishing that in a fully automated way using <a href="https://www.stackhawk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackHawk</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis CI</a>.</p>



<p>In this tutorial, we will build and containerize an intentionally flawed Django app called <em>vuln_django</em>, based on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django Tutorial</a> series. We will stand up an integration environment complete with an Nginx front-end and a PostgreSQL database backend using Docker Compose. Finally, we will test our app for security vulnerabilities using StackHawk. And we will do all of this in a self-contained Travis CI build environment, triggered by pushes to GitHub.</p>



<h3>Getting Started</h3>



<p>You will need accounts with <a href="https://app.stackhawk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackHawk</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis CI</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. You will also need some familiarity with Git and Docker. Familiarity with Python and Django is helpful, but not necessary.</p>



<p>You should have the following software installed on your computer.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Compose</a></li><li>Python 3 (`<a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">brew</a> install python` on MacOS)</li><li>All prerequisites for Python3 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysqlclient</a> (`brew install mysql` on MacOS)</li><li>All prerequisites for Python3 <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">psycopg2</a> (`brew install postgres` on MacOS)</li></ul>



<h3>Fork and Clone vuln_django_play</h3>



<p>Fork a copy of the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kaakaww/vuln_django_play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vuln_django_play</a> repository to your own GitHub account. Then clone the fork to your workstation. This repo already contains all of the automation that we will be creating in this tutorial and more. Since that’s what we want to create, remove it by running the script, <code>delete-automation.sh</code>.</p>



<div><div>
<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;fileName&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">cd vuln_django_play
scripts/delete-automation.sh</pre></div>
</div></div>



<p>Now try running <em>vuln_django</em> locally to verify that it works.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;htmlmixed&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">python3 -m venv env&lt;br&gt;$ source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py seed polls --number=5
python manage.py test
python manage.py runserver</pre></div>



<p>Browse to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> and you should see the <em>vuln_django</em> polling application! The strange polls you see were generated in the <code>seed</code> step above, and the poll data is stored in a SQLite database that was created with the <code>migrate</code> step.</p>



<p>Hit <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;-c</code> to stop the development server.</p>



<h3>Containerize vuln_django</h3>



<p>Rather than running the development server, let’s run the app with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gunicorn</a> for better performance, and to better simulate a production environment. And for portability, let’s containerize it.</p>



<p>Create a Dockerfile at the base of your cloned repo with the following contents.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;dockerfile&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-dockerfile&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Dockerfile&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;docker&quot;}"># Create the base stage
FROM python:3.7-buster as base

COPY requirements.txt /opt/app/
COPY vuln_django/ /opt/app/vuln_django/vuln_django
COPY static/ /opt/app/vuln_django/static
COPY templates/ /opt/app/vuln_django/templates
COPY polls/ /opt/app/vuln_django/polls
COPY manage.py /opt/app/vuln_django/

RUN pip install -r /opt/app/requirements.txt

# Create the micro stage to run as a gunicorn container
FROM base as micro
ARG SERVER_PORT=8010
ENV SERVER_PORT=${SERVER_PORT}
EXPOSE ${SERVER_PORT}:${SERVER_PORT}
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    netcat
WORKDIR /opt/app/vuln_django
CMD exec gunicorn vuln_django.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:${SERVER_PORT} --workers 3</pre></div>



<p>Build the container image and run it to make sure you get the same results as when you ran the app manually.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker build . --tag vuln_django:micro
docker run --rm --detach --publish 8010:8010 --name vuln-django vuln_django:micro
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py migrate
docker exec -it vuln-django python manage.py createsuperuser
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py seed polls --number=5
docker exec vuln-django python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Browse to the containerized app server at <a href="http://localhost:8010/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8010/</a>, and once again you should see some polls. Go to <a href="http://localhost:8010/admin/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8010/admin/</a> and log on with the superuser credentials you created, and check out the Django admin interface.</p>



<p>Notice how we ran migrations, seed data, and tests as <code>docker exec</code> commands. As before, those commands created a SQLite database file, this time within the container, and populated it with seed data.</p>



<p>Cool! Shut it down.</p>







<p>Since we used the <code>--rm</code> flag to <code>docker run</code>, the container goes away, along with all of its data. If you started it again, you would again need to run migrations, create the superuser, and seed the data for the app to work.</p>



<h3>Build a Docker Compose Configuration</h3>



<p>Let’s make this look more like a real application environment by assembling some supporting services in Docker Compose. We will add an Nginx container to host static files and forward requests to our app, and we’ll add a PostgreSQL database to host the polling data.</p>



<p>Create a file, <code>docker-micro.yml</code> and add the following contents:</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-yaml&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;YAML&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;}">version: "3.7"

services:
  vuln-proxy:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf.micro:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      - ./static:/opt/app/vuln_django/static:ro
    ports:
      - 8020:8020
    depends_on:
      - vuln-django

  vuln-django:
    image: vuln_django:micro
    build:
          context: .
          target: micro
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=admin
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=adminpassword
      - DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
      - SQL_ENGINE=django.db.backends.postgresql
      - SQL_HOST=db
      - SQL_PORT=5432
      - SQL_DATABASE=django_db
      - SQL_USER=django_user
      - SQL_PASSWORD=django_password

  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=django_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=django_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=django_password
</pre></div>



<p>Notice that the <code>vuln-django</code> service requires the container image, <code>vuln_django:micro</code>. The <code>build</code> section specifies where to find the Dockerfile for <code>vuln_django:micro</code>, and which target stage to build. Recall we added a <em>micro</em> stage to the Dockerfile above.</p>



<p>Under <code>services.vuln-django.environment</code>, we populate several variables to tell the <code>vuln-django</code> service how to connect to its database, and how to create a superuser account for the Django Admin interface. Notice that SQL_HOST is set to <code>db</code>, which is the name of our PostgreSQL service defined in <code>services.db</code>.</p>



<p>The <code>db</code> service uses the official <code>postgres</code> image, and we configure the database, username, and passwords with environment variables.</p>



<p>Finally, the <code>vuln-proxy</code> service is an official Nginx container with a custom configuration <code>nginx.conf.micro</code>. This configuration serves custom static content from the <code>/static</code> directory, mounted as a volume from the <code>./static</code> directory in the project repo, and forwards all other requests to <code>http://vuln-django:8010</code>. We publish port <code>8020</code> as a convenience so that we can test this service locally.</p>



<p>Build and run this Docker Compose configuration.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml build
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml up --detach</pre></div>



<p>Run migrations and setup as before, using docker-compose to <code>exec</code> the commands on the <code>vuln-django</code> service container.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py migrate
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py seed polls --number=5
docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Now that the database has been configured and seeded, click around to see how it looks at <a href="http://localhost:8020/polls/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8020/polls/</a>. You should see a new waving Pikachu in the background, since we are now serving extra static content from the Nginx proxy service.</p>



<p>Great! Now shut your stack down and remove all of the containers.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml down</pre></div>



<h3>Add Automation</h3>



<p>This is looking good, but there are a lot of steps to build this stack and run it. Let’s script what we have done so far.</p>



<p>Create a file in your project called <code>scripts/build-and-run.sh</code>, and add the following content.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build and run vuln-django with Nginx and PostgreSQL
set -ex

# We'll use this `docker-compose exec` command a lot...
EXEC_CMD='docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml exec vuln-django'

# Build docker images, in particular the vuln-django container
docker-compose -f docker-micro.yml build

# Launch the app, PostgreSQL and Nginx
docker-compose -f docker-micro.yml up --detach

# Wait for the database, using netcat to ping it
echo Wait for database to become available...
while ! ${EXEC_CMD} bash -c 'nc -z "${SQL_HOST}" "${SQL_PORT}"'; do
  sleep 0.5
done
echo Database ready!

# Run database migrations to build tables
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py migrate

# Create Django admin user from DJANGO_SUPERUSER_ environment variables
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py createsuperuser --no-input

# Seed database with test data
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py seed polls --number=5

# Run unit tests
${EXEC_CMD} python manage.py test</pre></div>



<p>Make the script executable.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">chmod 755 scripts/build-and-run.sh</pre></div>



<p>Now bring the whole stack up like so.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">./scripts/build-and-run.sh</pre></div>



<p>And again, tear it down.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-sh&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Shell&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;shell&quot;}">docker-compose --file docker-micro.yml down</pre></div>



<p>Try that a few more times, and click around the app to make sure it all looks good.</p>



<h3>Add HawkScan</h3>



<p>Create a <code>stackhawk.yml</code> file and add the following content. Be sure to replace <code>&lt;STACKHAWK_APP_ID&gt;</code> with your own StackHawk application ID. Check your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.stackhawk.com/applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app list</a> if you need to find or create one.</p>



<div><pre data-setting="{&quot;mode&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;,&quot;mime&quot;:&quot;text/x-yaml&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;material&quot;,&quot;lineNumbers&quot;:true,&quot;styleActiveLine&quot;:false,&quot;lineWrapping&quot;:true,&quot;readOnly&quot;:true,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;YAML&quot;,&quot;modeName&quot;:&quot;yaml&quot;}">app:
  applicationId: &lt;STACKHAWK_APP_ID&gt;
  env: ${APP_ENV:Travis CI}
  host: ${HOST:http://localhost:8020}
  riskLevel: MEDIUM
  appDataType: PII
  antiCsrfParam: csrfmiddlewaretoken
  excludePaths:
    - /admin/logout/ # the scanner will log itself out if you don't ignore here
    - …</pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Let me tell you a story about the Enterprise Java Programmers from eBay.  When eBay was founded Java was <em>hot</em>.  Everyone was using Java.  If you were a <em>serious real programmer</em>, you did everything in Java.  I know because I got sucked into endless terrible Java projects up until 2008 when the banks collapsed and swirled around the economic toilet, taking the turd Enterprise Java with them.  People laugh, but the banks dying in 2008 is really what wiped out Enterprise Java as we know it and killed off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">Sun</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, in 2008 about 40-50% of Sun's money came from banks running Java.  When the banks collapsed because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">mortgage backed securities fraud</a> a huge chunk of Sun's money evaporated practically overnight.  As smaller banks were absorbed into the three remaining larger banks the contractual obligations to Sun were canceled.  There was also a form of "guilt by association" because Java was associated with inflexible old systems that couldn't be changed fast enough to survive the 2008 crash.  I know this because I literally worked on one of these inflexible Java systems at Bear Stearns and watched this all unfold in real time in 2008.</p>
<p>I say Enterprise Java because Java continued on life support when Google/Android used it in their phones.  If it weren't for Android Java--the language--would have died the miserable death it deserved in 2008.  That's why I keep saying "Enterprise", because that version of Java was a special brand of obnoxious hell most programmers from then hate.  It was this bizarre infinitely indirect convoluted code that seemed to only exist to keep Enterprise Programmers in their jobs.  I remember to this day obnoxious "old beard" Java programmers who would brow beat you and harass you if you didn't wrap everything in an <code>AbstractFactoryIndirectFactoryFactory</code>.</p>
<p>This use of convoluted code full of <code>AbstractFactory</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleths</a> did actually do its job of excluding new entrants to the industry and also keeping programmers employed.  You couldn't fire those Enterprise Java programmers because they were the only ones who knew that incredibly convoluted code to fix that bug once a year that weirdly showed up right about the time they were supposed to get bonuses.  You had to pay 8000 people a year to basically sit and watch a bunch of Java virtual machines do nothing or else one day (right before bonuses) these VMs would implode and you'd have nobody around to fix them.</p>
<p>The problem with the Enterprise Java Programmer (EJP) and their job protectionism is companies die, and when they do you need to find a new job.  You would think the collapse of 2008 would teach these programmers this lesson, but they did not learn it at all.  You'd think they'd realize no job is safe anymore, and that they need to always have a second language in their back pocket and a plethora of alternative projects just in case they need to jump off the burning ship.</p>
<p>Nope, and the programmers at eBay are an excellent example.</p>
<h2 id="e-bay-wised-up"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#e-bay-wised-up">eBay Wised Up</a></h2>
<p>I used eBay a few times, and even in 2014 it still had old creaky garbage user interfaces.  When you did a checkout it would inject <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tags back to its own services to show you simple things like...an invoice.  That might be fine here and there, but eBay was riddled with these iframe cockroaches.  Paypal (which was owned by eBay at the time) was nearly the same way, with terrible UIs all over and creaky infrastructure.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the cause of this perpetual terrible UI was the EJPs and their job protective code.  In order to maintain their jobs they created a system that was difficult to change without their help.  That <em>also</em> makes the code difficult for <em>them</em> to change, so most likely when they're asked to "please make the UI modern", they claim its "impossible".  You'd ask if they can puhhleaze just use something like bootstrap, and the EJP will go look at their creaky old Java code with its hand coded HTML embedded in a <code>FactoryFactoryImplInterface</code> and say, "No that'd be impossible."</p>
<p>This impossibility was demonstrated as a lie.  Eventually Paypal was spun off on its own and <em>suddenly</em> their UI started to improve.  Paypal shared the same programmers as eBay, but after the spinoff they were able to fire those crotchety old EJPs and hire some better UI designers to improve the application.  Paypal had to do this because of competition from Stripe which was owning them in the developer market with nice UIs and documentation.</p>
<p>After Paypal showed you <em>could</em> improve this supposedly "impossible" code I believe it started a war within eBay that eventually culminated in eBay firing about 3000 Enterprise Java Programmers.  There's no official number, but the information I have from sources inside puts it at around 3000-8000 fired and the CTO trying to hire <em>anyone else</em> to improve the company.</p>
<p>Eventually companies like eBay either die, or get smart and realize that firing inflexible "impossible" programmers is the only way forward.  When you look at many of the banks from 2008, you can always find some piece of inflexible technology controlled by a programmer who thinks keeping it inflexible will save their job.  The irony of this attitude is that being inflexible eventually kills the company, costing them their job, but <em>also</em> makes it difficult for them to find work after.</p>
<p>The eBay programmers are excellent demonstrations of this effect.  Many of them couldn't even switch over to Android development.  I know many that switched over to non-programming jobs or just retired entirely.  Most of them didn't have anything else to show for their decades at eBay and had no ability to learn any new languages.  They had no potential side businesses to start, no additional demonstrations of skill, and no way to explain how they spent 20 years keeping  invoicing <code>AbstractInterfaceImpl</code> <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> Virtual Machine running.</p>
<h2 id="the-truths"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#the-truths">The Truths</a></h2>
<p>A lot of the people who tell you not to code at home try to cast this viewpoint as some sort of proletariat revolt against the machinery of late capitalism.  I grew up extremely poor and I can tell you that none of these people have ever been truly poor.  People who are actually poor want to work, and know that you can lose everything in an instant so they do everything they can to keep working.  Work is not shameful or a sign that you're a loser.  Many people want to work and people saying they don't doesn't make them edgy or socialist.  It makes them privileged.</p>
<p>Anyone telling you to work <em>less</em> is <em>not</em> your friend.   The same goes for anyone shaming you for wanting to make more money.  Usually these people are privileged with a family or spouse who can take care of them. If they suddenly lose their job, they have an alternative degree and programming is just a minor stepping stone to something else, or they're just delusional and think they'll have their cushy job forever.  Their experience is completely different from mine and yours, so if you need to work, and you want to keep working in programming, then you definitely should ignore someone who has the luxury of learning one programming language to work at one company.</p>
<p>The truth is having side projects is <em>the main</em> way you build leverage against corporate greed.  It's harder to exploit someone who has options, and in my experience working on additional projects after work has given me far more benefit than any job has.  I can safely say that <em>everything</em> I learned over my career has been from the personal work I do, not from any job I've had.  I can also say that the most fun and enjoyment I've had in programming has been working on my own projects.</p>
<p>Therefore, I'm going to give you my list of true reasons that side projects benefit you as a programmer of any experience level.</p>
<h2 id="truth-0-side-projects-mean-freedom"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#truth-0-side-projects-mean-freedom">Truth 0: Side Projects Mean Freedom</a></h2>
<p>To this day there's hordes of programmers who think it's a form of oppression to have to work on side projects, when the truth is side projects give you choice, and choice is freedom.  With additional code done outside of work in another language you can choose to leave when you find a better position in the new language.  You can also potentially turn these side projects into new businesses you own.</p>
<p>If all you do is work on your company's code you effectively become stuck in their particular brand of code and their way of doing things.  Unless that company is one of the FAANGs your experience is in many ways going to work against you when trying to find new work.  That's because (as I'll explain later), your version of a language is almost always totally weird and incompatible with all the other totally weird uses of that language.</p>
<p>The company you work for likes this situation because they know you'll never leave since you have lost your experience with new technology, and learning it is difficult.  You'll just sit there babysitting the JVM that keeps the cornflower blue buttons running and not try to find a job doing Go because that's harder.</p>
<p>You shouldn't think of your side projects as some kind of calling card that you reluctantly do so you can get a job after your big mega corp dies.  You should think of it as keeping your options open through training and study so that you are free to get a new job when you see one or need one.</p>
<h3 id="truth-1-you-never-get-a-raise"><a href="https://learnjsthehardway.com/blog/07-your-side-projects-are-your-future#truth-1-you-never-get-a-raise">Truth 1: You Never Get a Raise</a></h3>
<p>Why would you need to go get a new job if you're making decent money at a nice and easy job?  Because <em>companies never give programmers wages that match their impact</em>.  You might get a 2% raise a year, which is less than the inflation of your currency.  You might get a tiny bonus.  Meanwhile, your code will be the main reason your company makes billions and trillions of dollars.  You <em>might</em> be able to get some stock options, and that's about the only way you'll get a raise.  Ever.</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://whatthefuck.is/memoization | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://whatthefuck.is/memoization">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Before we start, let’s make sure we don’t confuse memoization and memorization. Memorization is when you put something in <em>your</em> head. It has the letter “r” in it.</p>
<p>But <em>memoization</em> (no “r”) is a nerdy computer science topic. Although in practice it also (unsurprisingly!) has to do with remembering things, there exist snobs who will hold it against you if you say “memorize” when you really mean “memoize”. I am not personally one of them, but you’ll need to keep this in mind for some job interviews.</p>
<p>Okay, if these are different things, then what <em>is</em> memoization?</p>
<h3><a href="#tldr" id="tldr">tl;dr</a></h3><p>To illustrate it, imagine you’re writing a JavaScript app that calculates the weather based on the atmosphere readings. You don’t know how to do it, but luckily, there is an npm package with a <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function that you can use from your code:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>There is just one problem. No matter what you do, calling <code>getChanceOfRain()</code> takes 100 milliseconds. So if the user rage-clicks “Show me the weather!” button, the weather will have to be recalculated and the app will briefly freeze on every click:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>This is not ideal. In the real life, if you already knew the answer, you wouldn’t be calculating it over and over! You would reuse the result from your previous calculation. That’s what memoization is. <strong>Memoization means storing the result so you can use it next time instead of calculating the same thing again and again.</strong></p>
<p>In the below example, we call <code>memoizedGetChanceOfRain()</code> instead. This is a new function that we added which will check if we already have an answer — and if we do, it will return the previous answer instead of re-running <code>getChanceOfRain()</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This makes every call to <code>showWeatherReport()</code> except the first one instant:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>That’s what memoization is. When we say a function is “memoized”, it doesn’t mean we do something special to it from the JavaScript language perspective. It only means that we avoid calling it unnecessarily if we know its result won’t change.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>You can stop reading here, if you want.</strong> We’ll continue with a few extra details.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#memoization-and-parameters" id="memoization-and-parameters">Memoization and Parameters</a></h3><p>Generally, memoization always follows the same scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if we already have a result.</li><li>If yes, return it.</li><li>If no, calculate the result and store it for the next time.</li></ol>
<p>However, the actual implementation depends on our circumstances. For example, let’s say that the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function takes a <code>city</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>If we naïvely memoized this function like we did before, we would introduce a bug:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>Do you see the bug yet? The weather in Tokyo and London might be very different, so we can’t safely reuse the previous answer. This means that <strong>when we memoize a function and reuse its result, we have to take its parameters into account too</strong>.</p>
<h4><a href="#solution-1-only-keep-the-last-result" id="solution-1-only-keep-the-last-result">Solution 1: Only Keep the Last Result</a></h4><p>The easiest solution to our example is to remember both the result <em>and</em> the parameters for which that result was calculated. Here is how we could do it:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> getChanceOfRain </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'magic-weather-calculator'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastCity</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>city </span><span>===</span><span> lastCity</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastCity </span><span>=</span><span> city</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Notice how this example is subtly different from our original one. Instead of <em>always</em> returning the last result when it exists, we check <code>city === lastCity</code> first. If the city changes midway, we’re going to have to re-calculate the result again:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span></p></code></pre><p>This fixes our bug, but it’s not always an optimal solution. In particular, if our <code>city</code> parameter changes on every function call, our memoization becomes useless:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p></code></pre><p>Whenever you add memoization, remember to check if it actually helps!</p>
<h4><a href="#solution-2-keep-many-results" id="solution-2-keep-many-results">Solution 2: Keep Many Results</a></h4><p>Another thing we could do is to keep <em>many</em> results instead of just the last one. Although we could define variables like <code>lastTokyoResult</code>, <code>lastLondonResult</code>, and so on, it is much easier to use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Map</code></a> which lets us hold a result for every <code>city</code> value:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> resultsPerCity </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Map</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  resultsPerCity</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>This solution works great for our use case because it only ever calculates the result the first time it encounters a particular value of <code>city</code>. Every next call with the same <code>city</code> parameter will reuse the previously calculated result that we stored in our <code>Map</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'London'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Tokyo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>'Paris'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>  </span></p></code></pre><p>However, this solution isn’t without its downsides too. <strong>In particular, if we keep passing more different <code>city</code> values to our function, our <code>Map</code> will keep growing.</strong></p>
<p>So this solution trades faster performance for potentially unbounded memory growth. In the very worst cases, this can result in our browser tab crashing, especially if every result uses a significant part of memory (e.g. a DOM tree).</p>
<h4><a href="#other-solutions" id="other-solutions">Other Solutions</a></h4><p>There are many solutions on the spectrum between “keep only the last result” and “keep all results”. For example, you may keep results for the last N parameter values, which is known as an LRU, or a “least recently used”, cache. It’s nothing more than a Map with extra logic. You may also decide to <em>remove</em> past results after some time passes — similar to how browsers removes the cached assets after they expire. If our parameter were an object (rather than a string, like it is above), we could use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>WeakMap</code></a> instead of <code>Map</code> in modern browsers. The benefit of <code>WeakMap</code> is that it would automatically “clean up” the entries when our object key is no longer accessible. Memoization is a flexible technique, and you can choose between many tradeoffs.</p>
<h3><a href="#memoization-and-purity" id="memoization-and-purity">Memoization and Purity</a></h3><p>We should note memoization isn’t always safe to do.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function from our magical npm package does not receive <code>city</code> as a parameter, but shows an input box to the user:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> city </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'Where do you live?'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>If we call <code>showWeatherReport()</code> two times, we will see two input boxes. We could input different cities, and see different results in the console. But if we memoized the <code>getChanceOfRain</code> function, we would only see one input box! Each next call would keep returning the same result and wouldn’t let us enter a different city.</p>
<p>So memoization is only safe to do when the function is “pure” — that is, <strong>if it only reads its parameters and doesn’t interact with the “outside world”.</strong> With a pure function, it doesn’t matter whether you call it once or if you reuse its previous result.</p>
<p>This is why in a complex algorithm, it can be beneficial to separate the parts that <em>do</em> something from the parts that merely <em>calculate</em> something. The parts that calculate something can be pure, so they can be safely memoized and skipped on repeated calls. But the code that <em>does</em> something can’t be skipped without behavior changes:</p>
<pre><code><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>showWeatherReport</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> city </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>prompt</span><span>(</span><span>'Where do you live?'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"The chance of rain tomorrow is:"</span><span>,</span><span> result</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Now it would be safe to memoize <code>getChanceOfRain</code> —&nbsp;because it takes <code>city</code> as a parameter rather than showing the input box to the user. In other words, it is pure. Concretely, it would mean that you would still see an input box on every call to <code>showWeatherReport</code>, but the calculation would be skipped if we had the result.</p>
<h3><a href="#reusable-memoization" id="reusable-memoization">Reusable Memoization</a></h3><p>If you want to memoize several functions, it can be annoying to repeat the same steps every time: add a variable, check if we have the result, store the result.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a tool at our disposal — <em>functions!</em> — that lets us automate this. <strong>We will use a function to “write” this repetitive memoization logic for us.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take our first example that memoizes the last result:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Then let’s wrap it all (without any changes) in a function called <code>memoize</code>:</p>
<pre><code><p><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoize</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>memoizedGetChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isCalculated</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> lastResult</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> result </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>getChanceOfRain</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    lastResult </span><span>=</span><span> result</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    isCalculated </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>ret…</span></p></code></pre></article></div>

		<p>Making music is expensive. The hardware is expensive enough, but buying all the software you need can round up to thousands of dollars. A single license for a leading DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton Live can run up to $750.</p>
<p>But music production software doesn’t have to be so expensive.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take the Open Source Software (OSS) route, you can get cutting-edge music making tools for $0.</p>
<p>Finding all the right tools, however, is a challenge. A lot of existing OSS lists are outdated – some of these tools haven’t been updated since 2004. Most existing articles aren’t comprehensive enough.</p>
<p>Which is why I spent the last two days putting together the single most comprehensive list of current and available open source music production tools.<span id="more-4160"></span></p>
<p>Every single tool in this list had to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be free – no strings attached</li>
<li>It should be open source, that is, you should be able to access the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>While not all open source software runs on Mac and Windows, most of the tools on this list do. And of course, every single one of them works on Linux.</p>
<p>These strict requirements meant that a lot of popular Linux music tools, like Reaper and Bitwig, did not make the cut. However, there are perfectly competent – and <em>free</em> – alternatives, as I’ve shared below.</p>
<p>Another thing – not everyone processes information the same way. So I’ve shared the same information as both a long table, as well as a categorized list of tools. You can jump to whichever tool you prefer using the links below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#tab-view">Table View</a></li>
<li><a href="#cat-view">Category View</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want detailed information about the license, availability, and source code/download links, refer to the table view. For a quick overview, use the category view.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that working with free software is a little more complicated than working with proprietary tools. Some of the tools I’ve shared below might also lack the features or user-friendliness (not that music software is particularly user-friendly to begin with!) of their paid counterparts. On the flip side, you get completely free software, and you support the FOSS community.</p>
<p>At the end of this post, I’ve also shared some thoughts on building a completely free studio, including my software recommendations.</p>

<p>From audio editors to full-fledged digital audio workstations, there’s free music production software to fulfill most of your music making needs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top choices across each category:</p>

<h2 id="tab-view"><span>Building a Free Music Production Studio</span></h2>
<p>After going through the list above, you’re probably thinking:&nbsp;<em>that’s a lot of software!</em></p>
<p>This was a (pleasant) surprise for me as well. I grew up with Cubase before moving onto Logic and eventually, Ableton. In this world of proprietary software, you’ve always had a lot of choice.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect the open source world to have as many&nbsp;<em>competent&nbsp;</em>offerings as well. Some of the DAWs I shared above can go toe-to-toe with the best in the closed source world.</p>
<p>If you’re new to music production, however, going through all these tools can be a little confusing (and overwhelming).</p>
<p>To make matters simpler, I’ll show you how to create a music production studio for $0 – all by using the tools listed above.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand what you need to produce music</strong></h3>
<p>There are three parts to music production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition and arrangement</li>
<li>Sound synthesis and design</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these should be self-explanatory, but I’ll break them down further for the beginners reading this.</p>
<p><strong>Composition and arrangement&nbsp;</strong>is the process of creating a piece of music and organizing different musical elements (i.e. “arranging”) to achieve a particular effect. If you write an original song on your guitar, that song would be called your “composition”.</p>
<p>Depending on your preferences, you can play this song in different styles (rock, pop, punk, etc.) – this is called “arrangement”.</p>
<p>In music production software, composition and arrangement usually happens on a timeline view. You can add/remove different musical elements at different to create a song. The timeline is typically divided into seconds and bars.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the timeline view in Ableton Live of one of my tracks:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4225"><img src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="559" srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" data-srcset="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg 669w, https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement-300x251.jpg 300w" data-src="https://mk0midinationf1n6gur.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/comp-arrangement.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4225">The Ableton timeline view makes it possible to create complex compositions and arrangements</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Sound synthesis and design&nbsp;</strong>is the process of manipulating a sound or a signal to produce a desired effect. Add a distortion pedal to your electric guitar, and you’re essentially “designing” your own sound.</p>
<p>There are several approach to sound design and synthesis. You can take an audio clip (called a “sample”) and turn it into a sound via a “sampler”. Or you can use a synthesizer to manipulate a simple audio signal (such as a sine wave) into your desired sound. You can further modulate this sound using various effects like reverb, delay, etc. Add a reverb, for instance, and the sound will feel wider and roomier.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a screenshot from one of the sounds I created in Serum, one of the most popular software synthesizers around.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last night, I started a college class for the first time since I graduated in 2017. The weekend prior, I was accepted to Stanford. Well, not exactly. I was accepted to an experimental online class from Stanford called Code in Place which is based on the school’s well-regarded CS106A Programming Methodology course. </p>



<p>After being rejected by Stanford twice, once for undergraduate coming out of my gap year in 2013 and a second time for their Deferred Enrollment MBA program in 2017, it was nice to finally get some good news back from the Silicon Valley school where Google was born and <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/02/13/steve-jobs-stanford-commencement-speech-2005/">Steve Jobs spoke</a>.</p>



<p>For the record, I consider myself very fortunate to have received both of those rejections because, without them, everything afterwards would have changed. I choose to appreciate everything about my past because I do not see much benefit in wondering how things could have gone differently or wishing for ways in which they could have.</p>



<p>Anyway, a combination of discovering this course from Stanford one day, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">a class from Yale </a>the next day, and <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free">a number of classes from Harvard</a> the day after that made me realize that the coming shift in higher education has already begun.</p>



<p>Before speculating upon what that shift may look like, it is important to acknowledge that one of two things is likely to happen, and they represent very different scenarios. The first scenario is easier to imagine but harder for me to believe which is that universities will open up again next fall as if it is business, or rather, education as usual. This seems unlikely to me, but with an accelerated path to an effective vaccine or the introduction of some other unforeseen factor, I am hesitant to count it out completely while it still remains within the realm of possibility from my perspective. The second scenario which I believe is much more likely is that we will not go back to education as usual in the fall. Instead, education will continue to be online as it has been for the last few weeks under the guise of a temporary solution to be relied on only during this thought to be relatively short-lived shelter-in-place period. This shift to online education is somewhat obvious and predictable if in fact circumstances remain several months from now so that live in-person classes in the physical world will no longer be feasible, practical, or responsible, and it is important to remember that if any institution is going to risk lives and people’s health, liberal arts colleges are probably the least likely of them all to do so. What is not as obvious or easily predictable from my perspective is how the new digital format for classes will change countless other aspects of higher education and society at large.</p>



<p>Scott Galloway had an excellent monologue on this subject in the most recent episode of his eponymous podcast, The Prof G Show. (For those who read <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/03/30/the-weekend-miscellaneous-7-six-easy-pieces-burn-after-reading-bedminster-pizza-ttyl-bombshell/">a previous post in which I tried to use the word eponymous but somewhat forced it</a>, hopefully we can agree this usage was much cleaner and closer to correct.) In his monologue, Scott talks about how elite universities have become the ultimate luxury brands by rejecting over 90% of their prospective customers otherwise known as students unlike even the most luxurious brands in the world like Rolex or Louis Vuitton or Rolls Royce would ever consider doing. He talks about how the value-add of universities lies as much or more in the certification than in the education and how higher education is ripe for disruption based on what he calls a disruptability index which he defines as “a function of your ability to increase prices faster than inflation without having any underlying increase in productivity of the product.” I liked that straight forward definition. Lastly, Scott talks about how schools will still want to make money and says that they will need to accept many more students in order to maintain revenues because their excessive prices, which have already garnered plenty of attention but which to date have been unrelenting due to continued demand, will now become much more egregiously apparent to even the wealthiest of parents who will have no choice but to ask why they are paying $50,000 a year for their child to join 3 or 4, 20- or 200- person Zoom classes per day, five or even only four or three days per week, taught by someone who seems less effective at online education than the people who teach the free Khan Academy videos. The college price tag that used to be justified by not only the certification but the overall experience and the access to resources and the dining hall and the dorms and the people to meet and the lifelong relationships to form, in addition to the hopefully premium version of an actual education which I am by no means discounting but simply pales in comparison to the monetary value that the word Wharton on a resume affords an individual to more easily earn over their lifetime compared to another individual with the word of a university that you or I and therefore most employers have never heard of or do not regard as good, let alone great or elite.</p>



<p>So, how will it happen that schools will begin to accept more students from whom they can generate lower revenues per student to equal the same or similar revenues as they are accustomed to? I believe we are seeing the beginning of it now, and if that is any indication of the speed and magnitude of the change, it looks poised to be large and fast.</p>



<p>I never previously had the opportunity to be a student at an Ivy League school. Already I now have the opportunity to become a student at all of them, for free. I think what we are seeing now is a land grab, or in more literal terms, a student grab. I believe the top schools are foreseeing the coming disruption of themselves and others and have come to the same conclusion that they need to expand their student base. Based on what I have seen thus far, it seems to me that they are beginning to test and implement a tried and true strategy that has been successful for so many tech and media companies before them, and that is, the freemium strategy. </p>



<p>Elite universities are now giving away their most basic offerings for free to get as many students on board as they possibly can so that the base is as large as possible for them to upsell once they figure out how exactly they want to do that based on what they believe will be the best way to monetize their student base which will soon be degrees of magnitude larger than ever before for schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and hopefully my alma mater too. I say hopefully because by default the schools that do not grow will shrink, not only in students but in relevance and prominence and therefore in the benefits that graduates will experience by having their schools’ names on their resumes. </p>



<p>Premium products will be varying and virtually limitless and the prices for the very best of them I imagine will be very steep. For example, one may be able to take an intro to macroeconomics class from Harvard for free but the advanced classes as one works his or her way up the chain of prerequisites to the land of advanced electives will cost money, likely more and more of it as the student advances further. Alternatively, I suppose all of those classes could remain free and the approach to charging for premium offerings could be focused more on gaining access to smaller classes or ones with more small group Zoom meetings or ones with better professors with better reviews. Perhaps professors will be paid more like restaurant workers in that they are given a nominal wage in exchange for their work and the opportunity to earn large tips from generous diners for their excellent service, or in this case, ad-hoc income from wealthier students for their one-on-one tutoring sessions or access to office hours. Unlike most restaurant workers, some professors could make an absolute killing this way. </p>



<p>I am not sure exactly how all of this will take shape but I am reasonably confident that if higher education is heading in a digital direction, as it appears to be, then the freemium model will be widely employed. As a result, many more people worldwide will have access to the best schools in the world, which is a good thing, but people will still have to pay potentially steep prices for things like certification which unfortunately are unreasonably valued by top employers making their seemingly unreasonable prices unfortunately reasonable. I’m taking the Code in Place class from Stanford for the next five weeks and I expect to gain the valuable new skill of basic programming for free which is awesome and amazing, but was not surprised when I read in no uncertain terms before applying that I would not be getting any sort of university credit or certification for completing the class. Of course, that would be far too valuable to give away for free. Schools will give away the product but not the certification, because that is the biggest part of what people have been paying for all long. One question I am curious to see answered is what happens when I and the 10,000 other students taking this Code in Place Stanford class with me put it on their resumes anyway? What happens if employers start caring less about where you learned and more about what you know? I suppose as with most things these days, we will just have to do our best to guess, or otherwise wait to find out.</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://visly.app/blog/state-management-in-visly | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://visly.app/blog/state-management-in-visly">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Visly is a large, complex React app - as you can probably imagine, state management is something we think a lot about. Recently, we decided to move away from using popular community state management frameworks and implement our own solution, named simply <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>. To many this may sound like a bad idea, and to be honest we thought so too at first. But after attempting to solve our problems with existing solutions, nothing was working like we wanted it to, so we decided to give our own a try. We're incredibly happy with the end result. Let me tell you why we built our own solution and how it works!</p><a id="background" href="#background"><h2>Background</h2></a><p>First, I think it’s important to give a quick introduction to the technical architecture of Visly for context.</p><p>Visly is an electron app written in React &amp; Typescript with a background Node process that manages shared state and our code generation pipeline. The frontend itself is split up into many smaller React apps, each running within its own electron renderer instance. This allows tabs in Visly to render independently as they are separate render processes. Each render process (tab) talks to the background process to fetch project data, which in turn is read from the file system. The render processes then cache this data locally to speed up interactions. Mutations, or changes to the data, are synchronized back to the background process and then shared with all other render processes to make sure they also have the latest changes. </p><p>An important thing to note is that the background and render processes operate on the same data models, but keep local copies to stay performant. Also, even though our background process acts as a backend, it runs locally, meaning we don't have the same performance and availability concerns a typical web app may have.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/h56a2v5anqe2/2HJYDGMJylae01yLg8cwKq/d0b65ae0ce848480c92f7bdaba249fa9/excalidraw-202012613850-2.png"></p><a id="the-problem" href="#the-problem"><h2>The problem</h2></a><p>Before migrating to <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>, we were using a mix of <a href="http://apollographql.com/">Apollo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/react-spring/zustand">Zustand</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">React context</a>, and unmanaged global object stores to store state in Visly. This led to a ton of problems keeping state between the various stores in sync. While this was mostly a problem of our own creation - we kept adding solutions without going back and cleaning up old solutions - and could have been solved by implementing and sticking with a single solution, the reason we kept adding additional solutions was that nothing we tried solved all our problems. </p><p>The issue with Apollo was not so much Apollo, but rather GraphQL; Visly is just not a great use case for it. In Visly, we need access to all data on every page of the application, while GraphQL is built for apps where every page only uses a subset of the available data. In addition to this, while Apollo does offer subscriptions for live updating data, they aren't designed to be the main delivery mechanism for data, or design for apps where all data is live. We actually ended up writing our own subscription mechanisms as well as disabling the built-in Apollo cache.</p><p>The issue with react context is that it's very hard to enable minimal updates to the component tree when data changes. When data changes in a context, then all subscribers to that context change, whether or not they depend on the specific data that changed.</p><p>The issue with Zustand, Redux, Recoil, and many other existing global state management solutions, which do offer fine-grained control of component re-rendering, was that they were very tightly coupled to the React ecosystem, whereas we wanted to make use of the same functionality across our frontend, backend, and command line tools.</p><p>We wanted a single solution that would solve all these problems and give us the ability to implement cross-process state synchronization, history management, performance debugging, and transaction support on a higher level, outside of product code. So we decided to build <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code>.</p><a id="requirements" href="#requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a><p>As we were looking to overhaul state management within Visly, we started by taking a step back to identify all our requirements. We then tried to work these into various open source tools such as <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started">redux</a>, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">mobx</a>, and even new libraries such as <a href="http://recoiljs.org/">Recoil</a>. While we could have gotten them all to work, none of them felt like a natural fit with how we wanted to manage our state, and would have required significant work to build plugins and wrappers around their APIs anyways. So what were we looking for? We wanted a tool that had:</p><div><ul><li index="0">Support for history management (i.e. - undo/redo);</li><li index="1">Minimal re-rendering of React components;</li><li index="2">Support for both React and Node environments;</li><li index="3">Built-in concepts for synchronizing state between different processes;</li><li index="4">Ability to split state between multiple stores and perform mutations across them;</li><li index="5">Plain function mutations &amp; selectors that can easily be tested and reused outside of React;</li><li index="6">Immutable data; and</li><li index="7">Was built for Typescript.</li></ul></div><p>We also plan to implement support for concurrent mode in future - it's something we're super excited to make use of in Visly, and I'm confident that we can implement support for in <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> when it reaches stability.</p><a id="visly-state" href="#visly-state"><h2>visly-state</h2></a><p>Time to take a look at how <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> works and how it solves these problems for us. In its most simple usage, <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> can be used almost exactly as React’s built-in <code value="useState">useState</code>, except that the state is stored in a global store instead of attached directly to a single component instance, meaning the state is shared between all components that read from it.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useVislyState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span><span>Component</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>state<span>,</span> setState<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useVislyState</span><span>(</span>counter<span>)</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>increment</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span> s<span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>increment<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Count: </span><span>{</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>In practice, this simple usage isn’t very common. We use it mostly for very simple global state, such as our <code value="zoomState">zoomState</code>, which keeps track of how much you have zoomed into the Visly canvas. </p><p>Instead, we make use of <code value="useValue">useValue</code> and <code value="useMutation">useMutation</code> hooks, which take selector and mutation functions respectively. Selectors are functions which, given a piece of state, return some derived state, either a subset of the state or some new state computed from the underlying state object. Mutations functions are what they sound like, function that apply mutations to a state object.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>interface</span> <span>CountState</span> <span>{</span>
    count<span>:</span> <span>number</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>const</span> counter <span>=</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Selector function</span>

    <span>return</span> state<span>.</span><span>count</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Mutation function</span>
<span>function</span> <span>incrementCount</span><span>(</span><span>state<span>:</span> <span>CountState</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>As you can see from this example, selector and mutation functions are just plain old Javascript functions and therefore can be shared with code running outside of a React app and can be unit tested very easily.</p><pre><code><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>'count is correctly incremented'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>incrementCount</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span>
    <span>expect</span><span>(</span>state<span>.</span><span>count</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toBe</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Another benefit of using <code value="useValue">useValue</code> with a selector function is that components can subscribe to only a subset of the data in a state object, meaning if you have a large state object and only change a single property, then only components that read that property will update.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> state <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> useValue<span>,</span> useMutation <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state/hooks'</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>One thing you’ll notice is how mutations make changes to the state directly instead of returning a new object with the updates included. You may even think that this is a very bad pattern, we shouldn’t be mutating state, state should be immutable! Well it is :) Under the hood <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> uses <a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer">immer</a>, a fantastic javascript library for working with immutable data. Before <code value="visly-state">visly-state</code> calls your mutations it will actually create a mutable copy of the state object for you to apply your changes to, it will then use immer to track the changes you have made and use those changes to create a new immutable state object. The benefit of this is that mutations become very simple to write compared to typical reducers which require destructuring many layers of nested properties.</p><h3>Synced state</h3><p>Another benefit we gain from using immer to track changes during mutations is that we can use that change set to efficiently synchronize state with a remote store (for example our background process!). We’ve built this functionality into what we called <code value="syncedState">syncedState</code>. A synced state works just like a number state object except all changes are synchronized via a global <code value="syncAdapter">syncAdapter</code>, this sync adapter can be implemented on both the frontend and backend to enable live sync of state updates.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> syncedState<span>,</span> setSyncAdapter <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'visly-state'</span>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/em_wave.png">
    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/sunglasses.png">
    The lenses on polarized sunglasses are polarization filters that only allow light of a specific polarization through. Image Source (https://vision-works.co.za/polarized-lenses-explained/)

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjaAxUO6-Uw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png" alt="Experimenet 3"></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">

<p><span>I</span>n April 2020, in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown, Ahmed Imran Kabir decided to buy a parrot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After most of the management classes Kabir taught at a university in Dhaka were canceled or moved online, he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project: becoming a part-time bird breeder. Sitting in his three-bedroom apartment one day, Kabir keyed in the phrase “Buy-sell birds Dhaka” on Facebook and joined about half a dozen groups dedicated to avian retail.</p>



<p>“Breeding pair. Age: 20 days. Contact by phone or inbox” read one post, alongside images of a pair of grayish-brown cockatiels. Another seller, located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in Dhaka, posted pictures of yellow-feathered lutino cockatiels, with the Bengali phrase <em>hat bodol hobe — </em>which loosely translates as “to change hands.” The wording was intended to circumvent a Facebook algorithm that, to prevent wildlife trafficking, automatically takes down posts with “buy” or “sell” in the description. If an interested buyer did contact an owner, the next step was to haggle over the price of the bird on Facebook Messenger.</p>



<p>Kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000-person Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/485404175472217/">A.S.ককাটেল পাখি হাত বদল</a> — “A.S. Cockatiel changes hands.” For that purchase, the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them, and Kabir paid in cash. He was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next two weeks, including breeds such as Gouldian finches, Bengalese finches, and crested Bengalese finches. Each pair cost anywhere between $15 and $60, depending upon the breed and its age. “At one point, I started running out of space to accommodate all the birds, and sent about half a dozen Bengalese finches, along with some Gouldians, to my fiancee’s place,” he recalled. Finally, he gave in and bought a large birdcage.</p>



<p>From discovery to delivery, this whole process happened on Facebook.</p>



<p>Kabir’s story is reflective of how the majority of e-commerce now happens in Bangladesh. In the absence of giant online marketplaces like Amazon, thousands of bespoke Facebook pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments, apparel, cosmetics, mobile accessories, and, of course, birds.</p>



<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/randi-rahbar-shopyobrand-iraq/"><em>“What do I do with a credit card in a country like Iraq?”</em></a></strong></p>



<p>The phenomenon has grown so much over the years that the number of stores on Facebook now eclipse the number of sellers on local e-commerce websites like Evaly, Ajkerdeal, or the Alibaba-acquired <a href="https://www.daraz.com.bd/">Daraz</a>. No one knows exactly how many of these businesses exist, but the most recent estimates suggest that Bangladesh <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">has over 300,000</a>. The low barriers to entry —&nbsp;all an aspiring entrepreneur needs is an internet connection and around $350<strong> </strong>to cover startup costs —&nbsp;present a tremendous opportunity for a generation of young Bangladeshis reeling from mass layoffs and fear of <a href="https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2019/06/28/rise-of-the-educated-unemployed">rising unemployment</a> rates, which are projected to impact at least 15% of the working population. It also has opened other doors: in a country where just over 15 percent of women have mobile internet access, <a href="https://idlc.com/mbr/article.php?id=192">half</a> of Facebook sellers are female.</p>



<p>By and large, these Facebook stores are usually window fronts for click-and-order shopping. Unlike in formal marketplaces, most sellers are not licensed, store their inventory at home, and partner with third-party logistics companies for last-mile delivery. It’s all very simple: after a buyer makes a selection, payments are arranged via off- or online methods, and items are delivered by mail. No equivalent exists in the West, where Facebook’s forays into commerce have been met with a muted response. For a 162-million-strong country struggling with poverty and limited job growth, this new model of business is illustrative of the South Asian concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"><em>jugaad</em></a> — making do with what’s available. And it already has a name: F-commerce.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nuzhat Akhter has</strong> been selling on Facebook for only six years, but she’s already considered a veteran in the F-commerce sphere. Her site, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/277430245935147/"><em>Posh World</em></a>, has over 8,000 followers on Facebook, thanks to her carefully cultivated selection of consumer<strong> </strong>goods. From her home in Bangladesh, Akhter sources all kinds of products — helmets, handbags, Ralph Lauren shirts, even branded car parts — and accepts preorders daily. If an item isn’t featured on her site, customers can send links or screenshots of things they want from any co.uk website. Customer service is handled via Messenger and her Facebook page, and Akhter guarantees delivery within two weeks.</p>



<p>The 34-year-old mother set up her Facebook store three months after the birth of her son in 2014 and has built a loyal following over the years. Akhter spends her mornings scouring the<em> </em>British websites of popular brands like The Body Shop, Superdrug, Clarks, and so on, hunting for flash sales or discounts. Once she finds a good deal, she shares the link on her Facebook group with screenshots: “3 hr left flash sale bodyshop 50%.” In June, orders totaled over $800. Akhter’s success is especially notable, as it’s uncommon to see a Bangladeshi woman running her own business. In many traditional South Asian households, women are discouraged from working after marriage.</p>



<p>The reason thousands of Bangladeshis depend on Akhter to do their shopping is that she has access to something very few of them do: a credit card, and an international one at that. “It’s my secret weapon,” Akhter said. To prevent money laundering, Bangladesh has issued roughly <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/business/banking/credit-card-market-still-untapped-1452808">1.5 million</a> credit cards, and even those cards have a $300 transaction limit for international online purchases. This has created a boom in cross-border F-commerce and turned retail arbitrage into a thriving sector.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce has also inadvertently ushered in more-direct models of customer engagement, moving away from impersonal help pages and suggestion boxes.<strong> </strong>Qazi<strong> </strong>Fahimda Hasan, the 26-year-old founder of an F-commerce business that focuses on beauty and lifestyle products, has made this part of her brand’s identity. Through Facebook Messenger, she shares tips for identifying counterfeit products, such as checking for irregularities in packaging, spotting spelling errors, verifying barcodes, and so on. She also invested in a mini-photography studio to take professional photos and videos of her inventory. The pictures on her Facebook wall act as a real-time bulletin board for her click-and-order store. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, the hottest new trend for online sellers is livestreaming. In China, consumers on Pinduoduo are using it to break into the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3022929/chinas-social-e-commerce-sector-more-double-us185-billion-sales">$200 billion</a> market for impulse and everyday purchases. In the United States, Amazon has been experimenting with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-live-launches-with-live-streamed-shopping-videos/">Amazon Live</a> Creator, which lets merchants set up streams to showcase their products. (So far, it seems to have had little success.) In Bangladesh, sellers go on Facebook Live to promote items, respond to questions, and take instant orders. Some products attract larger crowds than others. </p>



<p>“People simply go crazy for whitening creams,” said Akhter. “I mean, you could have 1,000 or 2,000 people watching a live demo on Facebook.” With little formal regulation, this is all based on trust. Many sellers aren’t concerned with looking glamorous or dressing up for the camera, and at first glance, their streams often come across as an ersatz version of the Home Shopping Network in the U.S.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, a seller who goes by only Sulaiman would spend his evenings holding Facebook livestreams in front of multicolor <em>sarees</em> in his clothing shop, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/2684482508481909/">Symbol Fashion House</a>, in Dhaka. Then, he was forced to change venues. In a twenty-minute stream from his living room, Sulaiman <a href="https://www.facebook.com/symbolfashionhouse/videos/">shows</a> off a variety of clothes on offer, explaining the decorative stones on a <em>salwar </em>and the embroidery on a fabric. “Each of our <em>chunni</em> prints cost 550 taka [6$]. Take a screenshot and inbox the picture if interested,” Sulaiman exhorts viewers. Throughout the livestream, buyers flood the chat, asking to see more colors and sizes. “We started doing Facebook Live only about six months ago,” Sulaiman told <em>Rest of World. </em>Since then, he has averaged about $4,500 a month in online orders.</p>



<p>F-commerce emerged in Bangladesh largely because there was no major e-commerce platform to absorb all the business. But although it’s biggest there, this form of selling isn’t exclusive to the country, or even the region: globally, 160 million small stores operate on Facebook, and in countries like Thailand, almost <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thais-embrace-shopping-via-social-media">half of all online sales</a> happen through social media. Recently, platforms have started to accommodate them. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/introducing-facebook-shops/">features</a> allowing sellers to customize their online shops and made it easier for them to catalogue their goods and process payments.</p>



<p>The rise of F-commerce is, of course, inextricable from Facebook. As whole sections of Bangladeshi society get online for the first time, many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook. According to one estimate, the social media giant had nearly <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/stats/facebook-users-in-bangladesh/2020/05">39 million</a> active users in Bangladesh in May<sub> </sub>—&nbsp;23.8% of the population. This widespread use has meant that F-commerce has expanded beyond cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet and pulled new kinds of consumers into online shopping.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If Amazon were to enter, they could wipe out the market.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also changed other dynamics. While Bangladeshi F-commerce shops relied on snail mail until just a few years ago, many sellers have hired logistics firms to carry out their quality checks, packaging, and delivery services, as they’ve expanded their businesses. Apart from transporting goods, logistics firms such as <a href="http://ecourierz.com/">eCourierz</a>, <a href="http://shopup.com.bd/">ShopUp</a>, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article"><p>Today it's almost obvious to state that good written communication creates a business advantage.</p>
<p>I've probably read more articles on written communication in the workplace in the last two months than over the last 10 years. </p>
<p>Most of these essays gave tips on how to become better writers.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but notice that many (if not all) of them questioned the same thing: the prose.</p>
<p>Everyone advised to keep sentences short and to the point, use active voice and not passive&nbsp;voice, use fewer commas and more periods, avoid acronyms, etc.</p>
<p>Let's be clear: none of these are mistaken or wrong by any means. But this made me realize how huge the misconceptions are on what good business writing actually means.</p>
<p>In fact, what separates most people from good writing has very little to do with style, grammar, local sentences structure, word selection, or even content per se.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people can't write well because they don't know how to control the logical sequence in which they present their ideas.</p>
<p>And that is the single most important act necessary to clear writing.</p>
<p>In this essay we're going to dig into how you can effectively share written ideas in a way that value time and effort for others.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-think"><a href="#understanding-how-we-think" aria-label="understanding how we think permalink"></a>Understanding How We Think</h2>
<p>Writing an idea is always the result of two macro-steps. First, decide the point that we want want to make, and then put into words.</p>
<p>To understand how we can effectively share written ideas, we need to understand first how we formulate them in the first place.</p>
<p>Deciding the point you want to make is the result of a 5-step process.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unbundling</em> a concept</li>
<li><em>Noticing</em> something</li>
<li><em>Articulating</em>/<em>Developing</em> an idea</li>
<li><em>Re-Bundling</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>Reframing</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-thinking-process.png" alt="State diagram to share the 5-step process one use to generate an idea."></p>
<h3 id="unbundling-a-concept"><a href="#unbundling-a-concept" aria-label="unbundling a concept permalink"></a>Unbundling A Concept</h3>
<p>Every idea begins with an unbundling process. Unbundling is an act of exploration that leads to the decoupling of all the individual items of a certain subject.</p>
<p>Unbundling something doesn't imply a deep understanding of it. It's more a perception of full awareness.</p>
<p>In fact, you might not even know how every individual piece works, but you know they all exist in separate forms. No hidden parts.</p>
<h3 id="noticing-something"><a href="#noticing-something" aria-label="noticing something permalink"></a>Noticing Something</h3>
<p>Unbundling enhances our ability to observe, and this can lead us to noticing something. This can be a pattern, an insight, a novelty, or even a minor detail.</p>
<p>If <em>unbundling</em> is the flint, <em>noticing</em> is the spark that really makes the fire.</p>
<h3 id="articulatingdeveloping-an-idea"><a href="#articulatingdeveloping-an-idea" aria-label="articulatingdeveloping an idea permalink"></a>Articulating/Developing An Idea</h3>
<p>Only when we notice something can we start developing an idea. That's where the creative part begins. That's where you try to develop your initial cue into a fully formed idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you noticed that something was unnecessary or too complicated, you might run a simplification process. If you noticed something was missing, you go through an addition or reinforcement process.</p>
<h3 id="re-bundling-and-reframing"><a href="#re-bundling-and-reframing" aria-label="re bundling and reframing permalink"></a>Re-bundling And Reframing</h3>
<p>Once you finish including your idea, you go through re-bundling. This is a reconstruction process. This is where you try to recompose a world that now contemplates your newly inserted idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bundling is a fundamental part because it's where you can verify if the your new world still holds up. If not, that's a signal you need to put more work in the articulation phase or what you noticed didn't lead to anything meaningful at all.</p>
<p>If at the end of the re-bundling process your world does hold up, you go through a reframing process.</p>
<p>On paper, this seems to be a very logical and clear process, but in reality it's much more complicated as you constantly repeat these steps of of unbundling, editing your idea, and re-bundling until you find a viable path.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/generate-idea-complexity.png" alt="The complex process of idea generation"></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea, you need to decide how to put it into words that you can share with others.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-how-we-write"><a href="#understanding-how-we-write" aria-label="understanding how we write permalink"></a>Understanding How We Write</h2>
<p>From a broader point, the single goal of writing is to get some information into someone's head.</p>
<p>Think about it. It's almost a simulation act.</p>
<p>You need to reproduce your reader's thinking process using your brain. And know how to build up your information in a way that feels logical and makes sense to them.</p>
<p>This process has very little to do with what you went through when you came up with the idea in the first place. In fact, forcing the reader through the exact same original path you took will have the opposite effect and create more confusion.</p>
<p>Here's how it often goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an idea <em>x</em></li>
<li>You write down a set of words <em>m</em> that lead you to <em>x</em></li>
<li>Because of the pre-existing narrative that led you to the idea, you associate <em>m -&gt; x</em></li>
<li>When you proofread it, you mentally get it. Not because <em>m -&gt; x</em> but because of all the pre-existing associations.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how most people write. And it's exactly why most people's writing sucks.</p>
<p>Not because they use too many passive forms or weak verbs (that doesn't help either), but because they aren't able to write from the reader's perspective. Most writings lacks the basic logical order and structure.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-good-business-writing"><a href="#what-is-good-business-writing" aria-label="what is good business writing permalink"></a>What is Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Good business writing is a combination of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information Context</li>
<li>Information Resolution</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework"><a href="#how-to-build-context-the-scqa-framework" aria-label="how to build context the scqa framework permalink"></a>How to build Context: The SCQA Framework</h3>
<p>Context is the "<em>you're here</em>" red arrow that you can see on almost any maps. Good information context helps the reader set the frame to understand what they're about to read next.</p>
<p>Shared context helps the participants make judgments calls using the same pair of lenses.</p>
<p>A lack of a shared understanding on the basic principles can easily result in a partial understanding or conflict on what follows.</p>
<p>What's the best way to build information context?</p>
<p>Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant in the 70s, solved this problem with what she called the <em>SCQA framework</em>.</p>
<p>She named this framework the <em>Situation — Complication — Question — Answer</em> framework. You can unpack more on this topic in her book “The Pyramid Principle”.</p>
<p>According to Minto, context is the result of these four sub-ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Situation,</li>
<li>A Complication,</li>
<li>A Question,</li>
<li>... and an Answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Situation</strong> is a non-controversial statement on a subject that you know the reader will agree because it's something he already knows. By summarizing what he already knows, the situation establishes the relevance of the questions that your document is going to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Complication</strong> describes an alteration of a stable situation. Keep in mind, this alteration is purely fact-based. The Situation-Complication combination should lead the reader to an immediate question.</p>
<p>The <strong>Question</strong> represents an intuitive response to the complication. The best Situation-Complication scenario makes the question sound totally superfluous to state. The best questions aren't posed, they emerge.</p>
<p>The <strong>Answer</strong> is the summary of your main idea. Beware, it's the solution, not the explanation of it. Good answers are typically represented by 3/4 bullet points. No more.</p>
<p>If you squint at it, you realise that the SCQA framework turned out initial schema upside down.</p>
<p>Ideas comes up in a bottom-up fashion, but they need to be told top-down.</p>
<p>This is not how we think. But it's how we should write.</p>
<p><img src="https://pulseasync.com/assets/scqa-reversed-thinking-frmework.png" alt="SCQA reversed thinking framework"></p>
<p>Another interesting benefit of building information context using the SCQA framework is that once you've gotten the initial part out of the way, you can focus all your energy on making and supporting the case for why it's true.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues"><a href="#how-to-increase-resolution-whyhow-dialogues" aria-label="how to increase resolution whyhow dialogues permalink"></a>How to increase Resolution: Why/How Dialogues</h3>
<p>Ensuring you and your reader are in the same place before you lead him through your thinking is a necessary but non-sufficient condition. </p>
<p>Once he's aware of the gist of your main idea (Answer), you need to argue and support it. That's when you need to focus on information resolution.</p>
<p>Think of <em>information resolution</em> as the density level of details that you're able to provide to the reader. The bolder the answer, the higher resolution levels it requires.</p>
<p>If you gloss over key important passages, people will not follow your thinking and might have a partial understanding of the message.</p>
<p>How do you increase information resolution?</p>
<p>You support your initial <em>Answer</em> using the form of Why/How dialogues. Making an initial statement that the reader doesn't know will automatically raise a logical question in his mind. <em>How is that possible?</em> <em>Why do you say that?</em> In your following answers, you're likely to tell him other details he doesn't know and this will raise further questions that you're going to answer. And so on.</p>
<p>The author will continue to write, raising and answering questions, until he reaches a point at which he judges the reader will have no more logical questions.</p>
<p>The vertical relationship of a why/how dialogue helps capture the reader's attention. It permits you, as an author, to establish an inner dialog that will pull him with great interest through your reasoning. The reader will be forced to respond logically to your ideas.</p>
<p>As you can see we've not made a full circle. We're now in the (previously discussed) unbundling part.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-good-business-writing"><a href="#examples-of-good-business-writing" aria-label="examples of good business writing permalink"></a>Examples of Good Business Writing</h2>
<p>Armed with our SCQA framework and the Why/How vertical development, let's look at the skeleton of some real examples.</p>

<p>It's one of the most common examples. common examples. A salesperson, after speaking with a customers, irrupts in the #product or #engineering Slack channels requesting the implementation of a given feature.</p>
<p>If you've been in this position, here's how you can Minto-ize an internal feature request for your product:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>
We have never allowed customers to customize XYZ in order to keep complexity low.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
However, competitor X has now shipped such a customization feature, and we’ve been losing deals because of that.</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em>
We now need to decide whether we want to allow some kind of customization as well.</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Directives are the most common internal memo. Executives write them to request something of someone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Situation:</em>&nbsp;
As you know we're repositioning product <em>x</em> for mid-sized enterprise. We need to teach you how to see <em>x</em> for organizations between 100 and 200 employees.</p>
<p><em>Complication:</em>
We've never sold to this type of customer before. Hence, we need to construct a new customer profile from scratch</p>
<p><em>Questions:</em> (How can we do the profile?)</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em>
We're going to host:</p>

                    <p>If you are desperate for 6% smaller Go binaries, this blog post is for you. (I did this experiment to help out <a href="https://www.tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. Disclosure: I'm an investor.) If binary size doesn't worry you, well, maybe you'll find it entertaining.</p>
<p>In order to get example numbers for this post, I grabbed a random item from my GOPATH. All the hard numbers in this blog post are for <code>github.com/mvdan/sh/cmd/shfmt</code>. From a bit of experimenting, they seem fairly representative.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9d812cfa5c">commit 9d812cfa5c</a> of the Go toolchain as my base commit. This is the <code>master</code> branch as of April 29, 2020; it will probably be similar to the Go 1.15beta1 release. I'm using it rather than Go 1.14 because it contains several binary size reductions, including <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/230544">one in particular</a> that you'll definitely want if you're concerned about binary sizes.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are lots of ways to shrink a binary. Removing extraneous dependencies is probably the best way. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/210284">Avoiding global maps through judicious use of sync.Once</a> can help. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/228111">Keeping separable code separate by indirection</a> can help. You can <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/1255704982893912064">suppress equality algorithm generation</a> (ick…until you really need it). You can usually save double-digit percentages by stripping debugging information: pass <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38777"><code>-ldflags=-w</code> to <code>go build</code></a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume you've done all that. And you still need to shrink more. And that need is so pressing you're willing to make some sacrifices for it.</p>
<p>Go binaries contain a lot more than just executable code. There are type descriptors that describe the types in a Go program. There are garbage collection data structures. There's debugger information. And there are mappings from PCs to position information. (And there's lots more, too.)</p>
<p>We're going to get rid of the position information.</p>
<hr>
<p>We can't just strip out the position information entirely from the binary. That would break lots of stuff.</p>
<p>But we can make all the line numbers the same. That shouldn't break anything. After all, no one (except gofmt) said we had to put our code on multiple lines.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <a href="https://play.golang.org/">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><p>We could write <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/skI5nMleZgt">this</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> ( <span>"fmt"</span> ); <span>func</span> <span>main</span>() { <span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>"Hello, playground"</span>) }
</code></pre></div><p>The Go compiler and runtime has to be prepared for lots of stuff to be on one line.</p>
<p>We could write a preprocessor, maybe using <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies"><code>-toolexec</code></a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives"><code>//line</code> directives</a>, but it's easier to just hack the compiler. Fortunately, this is well-factored code, so we only need to touch two little spots.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>@@ -23,3 +23,3 @@ type Pos struct {

</code></pre></div><p>Every file is now named <code>x.go</code>, and every source position has line 1 and column 1. (Columns don't actually matter for binary size, once you've stripped DWARF.)</p>
<p>This isn't quite enough. There are two other spots in the toolchain that get unhappy if all code lives at <code>x.go:1:1</code>.</p>
<p>The first is in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38698">constructing DWARF</a>, for debuggers. We can just remove that check: We are already stripping DWARF, so generating invalid DWARF doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The second is in cgo. There are some security checks about where certain cgo pragma can be located. We're going to trust ourselves not to violate them (by ensuring all code keeps building with an unaltered toolchain), and remove that security check.</p>
<p>The full diff is at <a href="https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed">https://github.com/josharian/go/commit/1a3e66ceed</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now all code we compile has <code>x.go:1:1</code> as its position.</p>
<p>Our program, compiled with <code>-ldflags=-w</code>, shrinks from 3,126,800 bytes to 2,938,384 bytes, or about 6%.</p>
<p>Most of this is from shrinking the encoding of position information. A little bit of it comes from a compiler optimization.</p>
<p>These two programs compile slightly differently:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>]
    <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>f</span>(<span>x</span> []<span>byte</span>) {
    <span>_</span>, <span>_</span> = <span>x</span>[<span>0</span>], <span>x</span>[<span>1</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>If you run <code>go tool compile -S x.go</code> on each of these files, you'll see that <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/UFf2JL">the first program</a> contains two separate calls to <code>runtime.panicIndex</code>. <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/26rRog">The second program</a> contains only one such call. The reason is that <code>runtime.panicIndex</code> must display a backtrace containing the line number of the line that panicked. In the first program, we need two separate panics, one for each possible panicking line number. In the second program, we don't, so the compiler combines them.</p>
<p>Since we are now putting all code on the same line, the compiler can combine more panics than before.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do we lose by doing this? Anything that needs accurate position information. Panic backtraces will still show you the PC, the function, the arguments, and so on. But all line numbers will be <code>x.go:1</code>. With patience, you could still figure out the line number yourself based on the PC, but it'd take some manual work. Pprof will still be able to analyze performance by function and by instruction, but it'll think everything happens on the same line, which will make analysis by line number useless.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's play around a bit. What if we ditch only filenames, and keep the true line numbers? It saves only 0.9%. And as you'd then expect, keeping only accurate filenames and making all line number 1 saves 5.1%.</p>
<p>So most of the savings are from the line numbers. What if we keep the original filenames, and truncate all line numbers to the nearest multiple of 16? That is, trim our diff down to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>@@ -23,3 +23,3 @@ type Pos struct {

</span><span></span><span>+func MakePos(base *PosBase, line, col uint) Pos { return Pos{base, sat32(line/16*16 + 1), 1} }
</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.2%. Not bad. What if we divide all line numbers by 16 instead? That preserves exactly the same information as truncating, but we have to multiply by hand to get the “nearby” line number.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/cmd/compile/internal/syntax/pos.go

</span></code></pre></div><p>This cuts our binaries by 2.75%! Why does <code>/16</code> save 0.5% more than <code>/16*16</code>?</p>
<p>Line numbers are stored in the binary using a <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/binary/#PutVarint">varint encoding</a> relative to the previous line number. Smaller numbers mean smaller deltas, and can thus be stored more efficiently.</p>

Summary</strong></span></p><h2 id="viewer-1p3ot">1. My Journey</h2><p id="viewer-e80g">I grew up a middle-class kid in Canada. I went to a Canadian college and started my career as an Account Manager at P&amp;G selling soap to restaurants. Somehow I managed to go to a top-tier US business school, get a job at McKinsey and fumble my way to becoming CMO at multiple Private Equity and venture-backed companies. For the last few years of my career, my annual compensation was over $1MM. After my last “exit” I realized our family had enough of a nest egg that I did not need to work again to maintain our relatively modest lifestyle. I went through a bit of an existential crisis trying to figure out how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. Among other other things, I started spending more time writing. I now have a reasonably successful newsletter and a book coming out later this year. I also spend time helping friends and acquaintances manage their careers — especially during times of transition.</p><p id="viewer-1eqa7">This study guide shares my advice on how to pursue an extraordinary marketing career (and hopefully most of these comments can transfer to other careers, as well). The biggest risk from this type of advice is the advisor simply explains how THEY were successful. There are two big problems with that approach:</p><ol><li id="viewer-862ah"><p><strong>What works for one person does not work for all people</strong>. Knowing Einstein worked in a patent office is not going to help you develop the next theory of general relativity.</p></li><li id="viewer-40o1q"><p><strong>Individuals tend to attribute too much of their success to their choices</strong>. Career success (and success in general) is based on a combination of (1) choices, (2) in-born (or long-developed) skills and talents, (3) effort, (4) opportunities, and (5) luck. Humans are primed to see things as cause and effect, and most successful people KNOW they worked hard and BELIEVE they made the right choices. Consciously or unconsciously, then, they underweight the luck and random opportunities that were outside their control. This is NOT to say choices and effort do not matter. It is too easy for people who are NOT as successful as they would like to look at those more successful and attribute it ALL to luck. The truth is it is a mix of all five drivers, but it means you need to look at all advice with a large grain of salt.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-e14t4">2. Why did I write this?</h2><p id="viewer-51klp">I’ve heard many people ask, “Why aren’t there more Ben Thompsons?” (author of Stratechery, and possibly the most successful newsletter written by an individual in the world). Ben writes brilliant analysis. He has accumulated somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60,000 subscribers paying $120/year each. After paying for his expenses and assistant, Ben is likely bringing home more than $7MM/year. Why aren’t more brilliant people following that path? There are 7 billion people in the world. There must be more people with the abilities and mindset of someone like Ben. Why aren’t there more Ben’s?</p><p id="viewer-873id">I think the answer is opportunity cost. If you have the ability to do what Ben did, you also have the ability to advance up most corporate ladders. You do not need to get to the top of the ladder to earn high six figures or even seven figures per year. To leave that a job paying $1MM/year to slowly build an audience feels impossible for anyone who cares about their compensation. As a result, most of the people writing about business on the internet are people who are trying to self-promote their own products (“shucksters” is the less complementary term) or people who have never held senior positions, have much lower opportunity cost, and are writing about business as outsiders.</p><p id="viewer-169i4">Most career management guides that fall into three buckets:</p><ol><li id="viewer-h9v"><p>Guides written by human resources professionals on “how to manage your career”</p></li><li id="viewer-2g9m2"><p>“Get rich” guides written by internet hustlers</p></li><li id="viewer-fs55h"><p>Cynical guides like “Career Warfare” that teach you how to play office politics</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-2tkd7">What is missing is a guide for traditional employees who want to accelerate their career to the executive ranks quickly AND ethically — and then continue to advance once in the executive suite. The people who could have written a book like that are too busy “doing the work” to spend the time and effort to create the guide. They have better things to do with their time.</p><p id="viewer-644ei">I am a sucker for a gap in the marketplace. And it turns out that while I enjoy writing even more than I enjoy growing companies, I somehow managed to grow enough companies well enough for long enough that I have the financial flexibility to walk away from that opportunity cost and spend time doing the things I like. Like writing this document and giving it away for free.</p><p id="viewer-9tosg">I LIKE helping people grow their careers in ethical ways. And I have the financial flexibility now that I can do whatever I like doing. This is it.</p><h2 id="viewer-63bo4">3. Which job do you want?</h2><p id="viewer-8f317">When Charlie Songhurst (former head of strategy for Microsoft) was interviewed on “Invest Like the Best” he described three “vices” and three “virtues” that motivated people in their careers:</p><p id="viewer-52sb5"><strong>Vices:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-6k3pc"><p>Money</p></li><li id="viewer-3e0el"><p>Power</p></li><li id="viewer-at8kj"><p>Fame</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-9f52c"><strong>Virtues:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-9hdcp"><p>Impact</p></li><li id="viewer-an9k7"><p>Intellectual interest</p></li><li id="viewer-6ot7i"><p>Working with people</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-vf99">Songhurst probes for the true motivations in everyone he interviews and even asks them to “stack rank” their vices. Until these options are articulated, most people tend to assume that other people share their own personal ranking, but different stack ranks naturally lend themselves to different jobs and careers.</p><p id="viewer-fsp7n">There is a type of advice that says, “do what you love and you will never have to work a day in your life,” but advice like that is dangerous. For many people what they LOVE is not going to pay the bills and allow them do to other things that they LIKE (or avoid doing the things they DISLIKE). Taken to the extreme, “doing what you love” may result in someone spending their days painting, but then spending their evenings shovelling manure. To solve this dilemma, other advisors have created Venn diagrams like this:</p><div id="viewer-2urvc"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.marketingbs.com/post/million-compensation" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc1c1f_f7296f1caa7446928792a5f4bdf7c9ae~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1200,h_676,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/cc1c1f_f7296f1caa7446928792a5f4bdf7c9ae~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-3tfpa">The world would be great if everyone could find their “purpose” or “reason to get up in the morning” (a concept sometimes made more high brow by using the Japanese term “Ikigai”). For most of us, though, there will always be trade offs between the five drivers. And besides: what if you found something you love, that fit your strengths, that impacted the world, but you didn’t really like spending time with the people who were willing to pay you to do it? Or more cynically, what if your driving vices had more to do with power or fame than with money?</p><p id="viewer-2pqgn">Here is my point: you need to decide what is important to you AND understand what the unspoken importance assumptions are for the people you are seeking advice from. If you care about becoming famous it doesn’t help to get advice on how to make more money working in a support role.</p><p id="viewer-1ih94">But I am also not the type to say, “all choices are equally valid.” Let me try and make the case that even if your motivations are the vices of power and fame, along with the virtues of people and impact, you should seriously consider increasing your weighting on the vice of money and the virtue of intellectual stimulation.</p><h3 id="viewer-6m8fc">Why money matters, and not just for the money</h3><p id="viewer-c8omr">I spent four summers in high school working at summer camps. Working at summer camps, even when you are sixteen, is NOT a way to maximize your monetary compensation. I believe in that first summer I was paid $40/week for a 24h/day job overseeing, entertaining and educating young people. After graduating from college, instead of spending a summer touring Europe, I decided I wanted to have one last experience working at a camp. I reached out to dozens of camps in the Northeastern United States looking for roles overseeing activities or running “counselor-in-training” programs. When it came time to commit, I negotiated hard for more money. That may seem like a funny thing to do. The difference between a “highly paid” role at camp and a “lowly paid” role is maybe $1000 over an entire summer, and I was about to enter a full-time professional job where, even at my entry level, I would be making that much in a week. Why argue for more pay?</p><p id="viewer-5cudn">(Aside: for many of you, the idea that I need to articulate the reasons why you should want to be paid more will seem insane. For many, “having more money is better than having less money” is the only reason you need. But, as crazy as it sounds, I think many people UNDERVALUE the benefits that come from having higher compensation)</p><p id="viewer-6iuep">I knew even then that <strong>what an organization was willing to pay for a role is a strong signal of the importance the organization sees for the role</strong>. WITHIN an organization, roles with more responsibility, authority, and opportunity for impact tend to pay more. In my experience, WITHIN an organization, the three vices (and to some extent the three virtues) are CORRELATED. The roles in an organization that are highest paid are also the roles that have the most authority (power), the most visible (fame), the most opportunity to have impact, be intellectually stimulating, …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/ram-250.jpg" alt="RAM" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->
      I bought my first PC in the Spring of 1993.  It was not the first 
      computer I bought, but it was the first useful one.  Between contract 
      engineering jobs at the time, I wanted to spend my time 
      productively by learning the increasingly-popular C++ computer 
      language.  So, I responded to a want-ad placed in the local 
      newspaper by an individual selling a several-year-old 
      personal computer clone with an 80286 CPU.</p>

   <p>Sometime in the late 1970's, the phrase "personal computer" began to 
      supersede "microcomputer" as the generic term for a computer marketed 
      to individuals.  I and many others were annoyed when IBM hijacked 
      "personal computer" and used it as the brand name of their 
      computer, as if no 
      other personal computers had existed before they created the first.  
      Today, almost all desktop and laptop personal computers are PC clones, 
      and no one has used the term "microcomputer" in decades.</p>

   <p>I drove my beaten-up Toyota pickup 20 miles North to the seller's 
      tract home in a suburb of the city.  On his dining room 
      table sat a computer in a tan rectangular metal case.  In those days, 
      computers were all about the technology, not the looks.  Just about 
      the only computers not in tan rectangular metal cases were Apple 
      computers, and they were not much more attractive.  I think the seller 
      sold computers as a side business, because I saw a couple of them 
      lined up against the wall.  The computer that I had come to buy only had 
      512 KB of memory, but I explained to the seller that I needed more to 
      run Turbo C++.  So, he opened the case and added an ISA card with six 
      more 256 KB simms of RAM.  I handed him $240 in twenty-dollar bills 
      and walked out with the computer, DOS 4.01 on 5.25 inch floppies, and 
      a monochrome amber monitor.</p>

   <p>In 1993 the sum of $240 seemed like a lot to pay for a computer that 
      old.  Younger readers must understand that, at a time when 
      CPU's were doubling in power about every 18 months, a computer that 
      was a few years old was viewed as not much more than junk.  In 
      hindsight, this was one of the best purchases I have ever made, 
      because that PC started me down a road that changed my attitude about 
      computers.  At this point in my life, computers had become headaches 
      that I was forced to endure in my job as an engineer.  Owning a PC that 
      I could use for my own purposes changed that paradigm for me and put 
      me on the road to loving computers.  My emotional attachment to 
      computers is actually more complicated than simple love.  Perhaps not 
      what I would call a love/hate relationship.  More like being in love 
      with someone with bipolar disorder.  Buying my first PC all those 
      years ago put me on the path that has ultimately led to the creation 
      of the Cheapskate's Guide website.</p>

   <p>After I brought my PC home, I went to a local bookstore and bought 
      a book called <i>Object-Oriented Programming in Turbo C++</i> by 
      Robert Lafore.  Then, I purchased a Borland Turbo C++ compiler for 
      $90 and went to work learning how to write C++ code.  I read through 
      the thick, Turbo C++ manual that came with the compiler and Lafore's 
      book and tried many of the programming problems.  A few months later, 
      I was ready for the next step.</p>

   <p>I knew the best way to learn to write code was to pick a project that 
      would take a few months to complete.  I also knew the project had to 
      be both fun and challenging enough to motivate me to stick with it.  
      So, I decided to write a graphical flight simulator.  I immediately 
      realized that I would have to upgrade my PC.</p>

   <p>To give younger readers an idea of how slow computers were in those 
      days, the ISA bus that was connected to the RAM card in my first PC 
      ran at 8 MHz.  Today's DDR4 memory runs at well over a gigahertz and 
      makes two memory transfers per clock cycle.  So, today's newer 
      computers access RAM in the neighborhood of 300 times faster than my 
      first PC.  The fastest modern CPU's are around 
      <a href="http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/linpack%20results.htm">four 
      orders of magnitude</a> faster than the 286.  Even the CPU in a 
      Raspberry Pi 3 is around three orders of magnitude faster than a 286.</p>

   <p>I had difficulty finding a 386-compatible motherboard with eight, 
      30-pin simm slots that would allow me to avoid buying new RAM.  By the 
      time 386 CPU's came out, the computer industry had begun transitioning 
      from 30 and 32-pin simms to 72-pin simms.  I finally found a local 
      computer business willing to sell me a used motherboard with the simm 
      slots I needed and a 386 SX-25 CPU for $35.  The problem of shifting 
      technologies and standards was huge, even back then, because it meant 
      that upgrading a desktop computer not only meant replacing the CPU, 
      motherboard, and RAM.  It sometimes meant buying a new hard drive, 
      internal cards, monitor, and other peripherals.</p>

   <p>Not until I removed the RAM from the 286 motherboard did I discover 
      that I had another problem.  The RAM slots on the new motherboard had two 
      banks of four simm slots each.  If I could not fill the second bank of 
      four completely, it would not work.  Unfortunately the two simms that 
      were attached directly to the 286 motherboard had actual pins soldered 
      to their contacts that fit into holes in connectors on the 286 
      motherboard.  Without those two simms, I would only be able to fill 
      one bank of simm slots on the new motherboard, resulting in only half 
      as much memory, not enough to run Turbo C++.  So, I would have to 
      de-solder the pins on those two simms before I could transfer them to 
      slots on the new motherboard.  Since I was new to computers in those 
      days, I was not 100% sure the simms would be compatible with the 386
      motherboard.  Even if they were, I assumed that I would damage them in 
      some way during the de-soldering process.  So, I was shocked when the new 
      motherboard booted up successfully and recognized all eight simms.</p>

   <p>By today's standards, my first PC had an impossibly stingy 20 MB, 
      5.25" hard drive.  I remember replacing it with a used 80 MB hard 
      drive that I bought for $85 at a local store that sold mostly used 
      computers and parts.  I was happy with that purchase, because 80 
      megabytes of space felt so roomy compared to my old hard drive.</p>

   <p>Walking along the isles of that particular computer store was like 
      panning for gold.  I never knew what treasures I might discover.  Old 
      and in some cases very old desktop computers lined bottom shelves all 
      over the store.  Today those old Vic-20's, Commodor 64's, TI-99/4A's, 
      TRS-80's, TRS-80 Color Computers, and a few that were so old that I 
      could not even identify them would be called Vintage.  But in the mid 
      1990's, they were one step away from the land-fill, too old to be 
      useful, even to me.  Used laptop computers were stacked on eye-level 
      shelves above the desktop computers.  Large cardboard boxes filled 
      with motherboards, sound cards, video cards, and other parts pulled 
      from old computers occupied the bottom shelf of one isle of the 
      store.  A shelf close to the ceiling on the east wall held a row of 
      assorted used monochrome and color CRT monitors.  The wide adoption 
      of LCD monitors by consumers was, I believe, still another five or 
      more years away.  I chose my first color VGA monitor from that shelf.  
      Its resolution was only 640x480, but that was sufficient for my needs 
      at the time.  If I remember correctly, I paid about $100 for that 
      monitor, which is coincidentally about what I paid for the 23" IPS 
      monitor that I bought from Best Buy three years ago.  I found an ISA 
      video card to interface with the VGA monitor in one of the large 
      cardboard boxes of video cards.</p>

   <p>As my flight simulator progressed, my 386 computer quickly 
      became unbearably slow.  The graphics capability of the combination 
      of the 386 CPU and ISA video card was not fast enough to produce more 
      than one or two frames per second.  I was forced to upgrade again.  
      This time, I went with a Trident PCI video card and a motherboard 
      with a 486 DX-66 CPU, which forced me to buy new 72-pin RAM.</p>

   <p>I spent a total of six months writing my flight simulator during two 
      periods of unemployment.  It went surprising well, and I learned much 
      about C++ coding, computer memory models, video memory, and 
      hardware interrupts.  Soon, I found myself looking for 
      intermediate-level C++ books, and not finding many.</p>

   <p>To make a long story short, I kept the case and power supply of my 
      first PC for 13 years as I upgraded through 4 motherboards, DOS 5.0, 
      DOS 6.11, Windows 95, and Windows 98.  Eventually, I grew tired of 
      lugging the heavy case around the country as I moved from job to job, 
      and I let go of the case and power supply.  However, I held on to the 
      original 8, 256 KB simms of RAM.  You can see them in the picture at 
      the top of this article.  Sometimes, I wish I still had that case and 
      power supply for nostalgic reasons, but as with most material things 
      that have outlived their usefulness, I could not justify keeping 
      them around.  Luckily, websites have no weight and never outlive their 
      usefulness, because they are infinitely upgradable.</p>

          <p>Modern application requirements have pushed beyond the limitations of DBMS (relational database management systems). NoSQL databases play an important role in cloud software applications, they store data in a format other than relational tables that does not require a fixed schema, they come in a variety of types based on their data model.</p>

<p>There are four main types of databases in the NoSQL (stands for “Not Only SQL” or “Not SQL.”):  key-value pair based, wide column, document-oriented and graph-based.</p>

<p>Both TerminusDB and MongoDB are NoSQL databases, both store data as documents, both have a flexible data model, that means that the database schema is flexible and can evolve in the time when the user exigences change, both databases support a rich query language, but TerminusDB is a <strong>version control document system</strong> and a <strong>graph database</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the main differences between TerminusDB and MongoDB in practice.</p>

<p>if you have never used TerminusDB before, this article includes everything you need to get started with TerminusDB.

<p><em>Note: We are assuming that you already are familiar with MongoDB.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2>

<p>First look at our dataset, which data we need to store and how this data is related to each other.</p>

<p>In our examples we use the collection of data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/bike_table.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The CSV data used this tutorial is available at <a href="https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv">https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="query-language">Query language</h2>

<p>MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language (<strong>MQL</strong>) for accessing the documents.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB we use <a href="https://terminusdb.com/docs/woql"><strong>WOQL</strong> (Web Object Query Language)</a>. It is a unified model query language, WOQL’s primary syntax and interchange format is in JSON-LD.
All our example are writing using woql.js a javascript layer that help you to compose WOQL query.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="create-schema">Create Schema</h2>

<p>MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents support embedded fields, so documents can store related information (data or list of data) together, fields can vary from document to document.</p>

<p>You can insert a document in the collection and MongoDB creates that collection on the fly or maybe you can create a collection with a schema validation before .</p>

<p>Let’s see how to create a new collection with specified validation rules. Here a fragment 
for mongoshell:</p>

<p>We have created our <strong>journey</strong> collection with embedded  the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> data entities (station_number,address) in the journey collection data. For many use cases in MongoDB, the denormalized data model is optimal.</p>

<p>In TerminusDB we have documents as well, so for our dataset we prefer to create three different documents: Station, Journey and Bicycle, every document has a label and a description and is identified by an unique URL. In our documents we have properties to describe the type of data and the documents are related to each other.  Following the link between the documents we can track the relationship between connected data for example <strong>Station</strong> - <em>many</em> - <strong>Journey</strong>.</p>

<p>An example of relationship between documents written in woql.js</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>when</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>).</span><span>and</span><span>(</span>        
   <span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>doctype</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Station</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>            
       <span>.</span><span>label</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Bike Station</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>            
       <span>.</span><span>description</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>A station where bicycles are deposited</span><span>"</span><span>),</span>        
   <span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>doctype</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Bicycle</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>            
       <span>.</span><span>label</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Bicycle</span><span>"</span><span>),</span>        
   <span>WOQL</span><span>.</span><span>doctype</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Journey</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>            
       <span>.</span><span>label</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Journey</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
       <span>.</span><span>property</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>start_station</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>Station</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>label</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Start Station</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

       <span>.</span><span>property</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>journey_bicycle</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>Bicycle</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>label</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Bicycle Used</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>…</span><span>...)</span>         

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the <strong>Journey</strong> document the range data type of the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> properties (ObjectProperty) are the <strong>Station</strong> document.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="load-data">Load Data</h2>

<p>In MongoDB you can’t import a csv file in the journey collection directly. 
We could use mongoimport.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
mongoimport <span>--db</span><span>=</span>mybike <span>--collection</span><span>=</span>journey <span>--type</span><span>=</span>csv  <span>--ignoreBlanks</span> <span>--headerline</span> <span>--file</span><span>=</span><span>"./bike_tutorial.csv"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the result will be a different collection schema</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>
</span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"_id"</span><span>:</span><span>"ObjectId(5f05f055c74146b286a61cf0)"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Duration"</span><span>:</span><span>831</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start date"</span><span>:</span><span>"2018-12-01 00:06:00"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"End date"</span><span>:</span><span>"2018-12-01 00:19:52"</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start station number"</span><span>:</span><span>31202</span><span>,</span><span>
   </span><span>"Start station"</span><span>:</span><span>"14th &amp; R St NW"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>........</span><span>}</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>if you like to create the documents from the csv file inside the collection <strong>journey</strong> you have to implement your custom solution, maybe you could using javascript for import the data from the csv file ( csvtojson is a node.js library) and <strong>mongodb</strong> the official MongoDB driver for Node.js to insert the data into the collection.</p>

<p>Here one example to insert a document inside the journey collection using <em>mongoshell</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>

<p>In TerminusDB we have a very cleaner solution to import csv files into the database, with a data integrity check for any newly imported records. We use the woql.js layer for write the query statement to load the data from the csv file.</p>

<p>A fragment of an import query.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We use <strong>WOQL.as(a,b)</strong> to refer the first row of our csv file that contain the column headers in our variables, for example the field <strong>Start station number</strong> refers the variable <strong>v:Start_ID</strong> and the  <strong>Start station</strong> refers the variable <strong>v:Start_Station</strong></p>

<p>With WOQL.insert() we insert  the data inside our database. We create a <strong>Station</strong> document for every <strong>v:Start_station_URL</strong> and <strong>v:End_station_URL</strong> value and we link this value inside the <strong>start_station</strong> and <strong>end_station</strong> properties in the Journey document. The relationship between journey document and station document  has been created. The relationship allows TerminusDB to normalize the data across multiple documents.❗

<p>Remember that TerminusDB is a graph-database, this means that TerminusDB
creates relationships between the documents and properties inside documents.
TerminusDB can analyze and traverse complex relationships between connected data structures. Let’s keep to practise❗</p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-a-regular-expression-">So, what's a Regular Expression?</h2>
<p><em>A regular expression (shortened as <strong>regex</strong> or <strong>regexp</strong>) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.</em> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>So, basically, a regular expression is made up of a series of characters (be it special characters like <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, alphabets and numbers) that defines a pattern. This pattern is usually used for finding text, and for validating input values. Here are two scenarios where you'd need a regular expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have a very long string in which you want to check if any e-mail addresses exist. You couldn't use any ordinary address because you don't know which address may be in the string. You just want to know if there's any e-mail address at all in the string. How do you do that? You simply create a regular expression defining the pattern which all e-mail addresses follow, and then check if there's any match in the string.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A user enters a name in an input field you provided. As a front-end developer your job is to validate the data on the client-side before the server also does it. Regular expressions provide a way to check if the data entered by the user is exact, or follows the pattern of data that's required. For instance, an input field that expects a name of a person shouldn't contain digits or special characters apart from a hyphen.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular expressions can be defined in two ways: using the built-in <code>RegExp</code> constructor, or defining it as a literal value with double forward slashes - <code>//</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Option 1: <code>new RegExp()</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>let</span> regex = <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span>(<span>"pattern"</span>, <span>"flags"</span>);
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Option 2: using forward slashes - <code>//</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>let</span> regex = <span>/pattern/</span>flags;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Where <code>pattern</code> is the pattern you intend to find;</li>
<li>and <code>flags</code> are optional tokens that add more functionality when finding the pattern you're trying to match. </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll cover flags in a bit, but for now, let's understand some fundamentals of creating patterns.</p>

<p>We're going to play with some regular expressions and learn how to use the <code>str.match()</code> and <code>regexp.test()</code> methods to determine whether or not a string matches a pattern. Here's our first example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp1 = <span>new</span> <span>RegExp</span>(<span>"Hello"</span>);
<span>let</span> rgxp2 = <span>/Hello/</span>;


<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp1));




<span>console</span>.log(rgxp2.test(string));


</code></pre>
<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>We defined two different regular expressions with different syntaxes but with the same pattern. You realised that the <code>flags</code> part was omitted in both expressions. It's optional; we only include it when we need special functionality, which we'll discuss in a second. 😉</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>str.match()</code> method accepts a regular expression as an argument. This is possible because regular expressions are integrated with string methods. So, you invoke the <code>match()</code> method on the string on which you want to run the pattern search; in our case, the <code>string</code> variable. You then pass the regular expression, which defines the pattern you want to search, as an argument to the <code>match()</code> method. If there's a match, it returns an array of substrings which matched the pattern; else, if there isn't a match, the method returns <code>null</code>. But in our example, the sub-string "Hello" in the string "Hello world!" is matched. There are additional properties attached to the returned array: <code>index</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>groups</code>. The <code>index</code> property holds the index in the target string where a pattern match was obtained; the <code>input</code> property holds a copy of the target string itself, thus <code>"Hello world!"</code>; the <code>groups</code> property hold <strong>groups</strong> captured in the regular expression, which, in our our case, is <code>undefined</code> because we didn't define any groups in the expression. Don't worry, we'll discuss groups too. 😃 So, with this result, it's clear that the <code>str.match()</code> method returns detailed description of the pattern search.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>regexp.test()</code> method, however, is invoked on the regular expression which defines the pattern, and the target string is rather passed as an argument to it. Unlike the <code>str.match()</code> method which returns a detailed information about the search, the <code>regexp.test()</code> method returns a Boolean: <code>true</code> if the pattern was found in the string; <code>false</code> if not. In our case, <code>true</code> was returned because obviously <code>Hello</code> can be found in the string "Hello world!".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The text <code>Hello</code> in between the forward slashes <code>//</code>, and string "Hello" passed to the <code>RegExp</code> constructor as an argument, are all simple examples of patterns in a regular expression. If you want to find a string which has the word "metal", you could define your pattern as <code>/metal/</code> or <code>new RegExp("metal")</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what if we run the search on the string <code>"hello world!"</code> instead of <code>"Hello world!"</code> (Notice the uppercase "H")?</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/</span>;


<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string));


</code></pre>
<p>Wait, what? 😕🤔 We had no match! That's because regular expressions, by default, are case sensitive. Meaning, an uppercase "H" is not the same as a lowercase "h".</p>
<p>And what if we run the search on the string <code>"Hello Hello world!"</code>? It should match it twice right? Let's find out:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello Hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp));


</code></pre>
<p>Oops! The same result. Notice it matched at the <code>index</code> of <code>0</code>; meaning it matched only the first <code>Hello</code> and then it stopped searching.</p>
<p>Let's modify these behaviours with <strong>Flags</strong>. 😉</p>

<p>Flags, in regular expressions, are tokens that modify the searching behaviour of the regular expression. Flags are optional, as mentioned earlier, and they make it possible to alter the default behaviour of regular expressions. For instance, by default regular expressions are case sensitive. Meaning the pattern <code>/Abc/</code> will not match the string <code>"abc"</code>. </p>
<p>There are only six flags in JavaScript and they're denoted by single alphabets. Here they are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Flag</td><td>Name</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>i</strong></td><td>Ignore case</td><td>Makes the expression search case-insensitively.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>g</strong></td><td>Global</td><td>Makes the expression search globally in the string, matching not only the first pattern, but all patterns in the string.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>s</strong></td><td>Dot All</td><td>Ensures the special character <code>.</code> matches newlines.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>m</strong></td><td>Multiline</td><td>Ensures the boundary characters <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match the beginning and ending of every single line instead of the beginning and ending of the whole string.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>y</strong></td><td>Sticky</td><td>Makes the expression start its searching from the index indicated in its <code>lastIndex</code> property.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>u</strong></td><td>Unicode</td><td>Enables support for unicode.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="the-i-flag">The <code>i</code> Flag</h2>
<p>Using this flag on a regular expression changes its default case-sensitive behaviour to case-insensitive.</p>
<p>Now, let's match the string <code>"hello world!"</code> even though our pattern is defined with an uppercase "H":</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/i</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string));


</code></pre>
<p>With the <strong><code>i</code></strong> flag, the pattern <code>/AbC/i</code> will match the string <code>"abc"</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-g-flag">The <code>g</code> Flag</h2>
<p>In our previous example where we tried matching the pattern <code>/Hello/</code> on the string <code>"Hello Hello world!"</code>, we only got one match, which is the first in the string. With the <strong><code>g</code></strong> flag, we can match all patterns in the string and not only the first:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello Hello world!"</span>;

<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/g</span>;





<span>console</span>.log(string.match(rgxp));


</code></pre>
<p>Note that, with the <strong><code>g</code></strong> flag, we don't get the additional properties <code>index</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>groups</code>.</p>
<p>You can use several flags at the same time, too:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> string = <span>"Hello hello world!"</span>;



<span>let</span> rgxp = <span>/Hello/gi</span>;



<span>console</span>.log(rgxp.test(string)); 
</code></pre>

<p>Sets and Ranges provide a way to determine whether or not a character, from a <em>set of characters</em>, is matched at a given position.</p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p><strong>Character sets</strong> are used to match one from several characters at a give position in a pattern.</p>
<p>Say you want to match these words: "sell", "tell", "fell", "yell". The words may be more than 4; but let's assume they have the same pattern; like with the 4 words above, they all end with "ell". The only thing different is their initial character. With <strong>character sets</strong>, we can define a <em>set</em> of these initial characters at the <em>position</em> where only a single one of them is needed, and then add the remaining parts of the pattern that's static.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To define a set of characters in a regular expression, enclose those characters in brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p>So, for the four words "sell", "tell", "fell", "yell", we define the set of their initials as <code>[stfy]</code>, followed by their last characters <code>ell</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> expr = <span>/[stfy]ell/i</span>;

<span>let</span> words = [<span>"sell"</span>, <span>"tell"</span>, <span>"fell"</span>, <span>"yell"</span>, <span>"bell"</span>, <span>"well"</span>];


<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> word <span>of</span> words) {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Matched "<span>${word}</span>" :::: `</span>, expr.test(word));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>Matched</span> <span>"sell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"tell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"fell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"yell"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"bell"</span> ::::  <span>false</span>
Matched <span>"well"</span> ::::  <span>false</span>
</code></pre><p>It is observed that, the first four strings in the array are perfect matches, but the last two aren't. That's because the last two have their initials to be <code>b</code> and <code>w</code>, which were not defined in the character set.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p>Let's match either "odd" or "add". Both words end with "dd", but they both begin with different characters, "o" and "a".</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> expr = <span>/[oa]dd/i</span>;

<span>let</span> strings = [<span>"Odd"</span>, <span>"Let's add 2 and 3."</span>];


<span>for</span> (<span>let</span> string <span>of</span> strings) {
  <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Matched "<span>${string}</span>" :::: `</span>, expr.test(string));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code><span>Matched</span> <span>"Odd"</span> ::::  <span>true</span>
Matched <span>"Let's add the 2 and 3."</span> ::::  <span>true</span>

<p>Just under two months ago <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/introducing-opennebula-enterprise-edition/" target="_blank">we announced the Enterprise Edition</a> of the OpenNebula software bringing a more tested, hardened, and production-ready version of OpenNebula for enterprise use—by OpenNebula Systems. And quickly following that, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://opennebula.io/ee-maintenance-release-v-5-12-1-is-available/" target="_blank">first maintenance version</a> of the 5.12 Enterprise Edition was released just a month later.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1024x646.png" alt="" data-id="26003" data-full-url="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1.png" data-link="https://opennebula.io/?attachment_id=26003" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1024x646.png 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-300x189.png 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-768x484.png 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1-1536x969.png 1536w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/EE_Release_Cycle-1.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></li></ul></figure>







<p>Today, we are glad to announce an additional development in our enterprise product release cycle: the introduction of new <strong>LTS versions</strong> to reduce the risk, expense, and disruption of software deployment. Approximately every 6 months, each OpenNebula major or minor version will be either LTS (Long Term Support) or STS (Short Term Support).</p>



<p>Customers can choose to use LTS or STS releases according to their discretion:</p>



<ul><li>An <strong>STS version</strong> will be maintained and technically supported for a period of <strong>7 months</strong>. This incorporates the 6 months until the next main version (LTS or STS) is available, plus an additional month thereafter. These are production-quality releases that serve as a proving ground for new capabilities by customers interested in adopting new major features and are able to perform upgrades multiple times a year.</li><li>An <strong>LTS version</strong> will be maintained and technically supported for a period of <strong>at least 27 months</strong>. This incorporates the time until the next LTS is available (which is at least for 18 months, but could be for longer), plus an additional 9 months thereafter. LTS releases are the “enterprise grade” releases of OpenNebula and are intended to be utilized primarily in production environments by customers interested in a release family with an extended support cycle.</li></ul>



<p>From its 7th month, the LTS releases enter into “Maintenance Support” in which they will receive only critical and compatible fixes throughout their lifecycle, (no additional minor enhancements). And the last 3 months of an LTS release support overlaps with the beginning of “Maintenance Support” for the subsequent LTS release. This provides a simple way for customers who are averse to too many changes to remain in the maintenance and extended support phases with no minor features across two LTS releases.</p>



<p>The newly-released <a href="http://opennebula.org/firework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> is our first LTS version with an expected EOL of <strong>September 15, 2022</strong>. The EOL of the 5.10 version will be September 15, 2020, which is in alignment with the former policy. And for those customers that have the need to maintain support for a version beyond the EOL date, we offer an “Extended Life Support” extension to do just that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This advancement in our Release Life Cycle Policy will provide users of the Enterprise Edition more flexibility in their software maintenance planning.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A Git commit’s author might not be who you think it is.</p>
<p>I’m old enough to remember when it was easy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">spoof</a> the email sender (send fake email that appears to come from someone else). In the early days of the Internet most people didn’t even realize it was possible, so they were easy victims. </p>
<p>Email is delivered by SMTP, an open protocol, which is what has allowed it to flourish as a global, distributed system. But it was also designed without built-in cryptographic verification of the sender (in fact it was illegal to export cryptography from the US until 1992!). Now we have protection against this, such as SPF and DKIM, and most email services will warn you if the sender isn’t verified (or at least that it doesn’t come from the domain that it claims to).</p>
<p>But today <strong>a Git commit author is just as easily spoofed as email was in the 90s</strong>. Like email, Git is a global, distributed system, and by default it also doesn’t have built-in cryptographic verification of the author’s identity.</p>
<p>So how can you be sure that all commits are really from the author that you think they’re from? GitHub accounts can be compromised and malicious code can be hidden in pull requests (e.g. malicious packages added in hidden lockfile diffs, homoglyph changes to package names or domain names, changes in binaries if you have any in your repo, or maybe just a malicious change that you didn’t notice). </p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>Git supports signing tags and individual commits, and the GitHub UI shows a “verified” label on signed commits:</p>

<p>Being sure of commit authors lets you focus more attention on less trusted contributions and it makes incident response a lot easier.</p>
<p>Git also supports rejecting unsigned commits.</p>
<h3>How to</h3>
<p>Here are a few options for setup guides:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would generally follow this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification">guide from GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>If you’re using OS X <a href="https://gist.github.com/troyfontaine/18c9146295168ee9ca2b30c00bd1b41e">this guide</a> covers installing GPG and includes setting up <code>pinentry-mac</code> for a passphrase entry dialog.</li>
<li>There’s also <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work">the Git docs</a>.</li>

July 21, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>

<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>

<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>

<p>2020-06-21</p>

<p>This is the only old machine that I have kept around. It’s from around
1995, I don’t remember exactly. Despite it’s old age, it’s relatively
powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pentium with 133 MHz, well, it could be worse.</li>
<li>64 MB RAM. It came with 32 MB and was upgraded later on.</li>
<li>8 GB hard disk.</li>
<li>Behold: An Ethernet adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is slow by today’s standards, but the RAM and the NIC make it
surprisingly useful. 8 GB for a disk is also more than you might think.
It’s one “generation” after DOS (think 8 to 25 MHz, 70 MB disk tops, 4
MB RAM, something like that), it came with Windows 95, and was blazingly
fast back then. It was the first time ever that I saw a <em>video</em> playing
on a computer, while other programs could be run in parallel.</p>
<p>I installed OpenBSD 5.7 a few years ago. Time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Originally, I expected this to be a very long blog post with a lot of
nasty details. There are some obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The machine does not have USB, yet.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support PXE boot, either.</li>
<li>I don’t own any blank CD-R anymore, so I can’t burn a CD.</li>
<li>It’s 2020 and Coronavirus is all over the place, so I don’t want to
    go out to try to find some place where I can buy CDs or other stuff.
    I can only use what I happen to have lying around.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how on earth would I be able to update that system?</p>
<p>What I did have lying around were some old 3.5" floppy disks. And much
to my surprise, OpenBSD 6.7 offers a floppy image. I copied it to the
floppy, booted, and … it just worked. It detected the NIC, requested an
IP via DHCP, and then the installer was able to install a brand new
OpenBSD via HTTP.</p>
<p>Holy cow.</p>
<p>What a humbling experience. On one 1.44 MB floppy disk, they have a
working kernel, enough drivers to support my hardware, a working
userland including a DHCP client, and a working installer. In 2020,
where a simple “hello world” in Golang needs over 2 MB of disk space,
this is absolutely mind blowing. Even when compared to other operating
systems from the 1990ies, I feel like this is pretty impressive, because
IBM PC-DOS came on what, 5 floppys? With no notion of networking
whatsoever and virtually zero drivers? But to be honest, that’s so long
ago, I can barely remember anymore what a vanilla PC-DOS felt like and
which features it had, so I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Since there are virtually no technical details to blog about, here are
some photos from the installation process. One of the last ones being me
writing this blog post in X11. And the very last one? That’s <a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/katriawm">katriawm</a>,
<a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/bevelbar">bevelbar</a>, and (invisible but running) <a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/git/nhkd">nhkd</a>. Whoa.</p>
<p>After the photos, I’ll put some quick configuration notes.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s a GNU Gnu. Deal with it.</p>
<h2>Configuration notes</h2>
<p>OpenBSD creates a unique <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=149887978201230">randomized kernel</a> on each boot. On that
old machine, this takes literally an hour. I have disabled both KARL and
library relinking in <code>/etc/rc</code>. This should be done using <code>ed(1)</code>
directly after the installer has finished: It offers you to open a shell
and the filesystem on which you installed is still mounted.</p>
<p>The system has neither USB nor PS/2. I can only attach a serial mouse.
It doesn’t get detected automatically, so I have to create an
<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Section "ServerFlags"
    Option "AutoAddDevices" "False"
    Option "AllowEmptyInput" "False"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Mouse0"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option      "Protocol" "Microsoft"
    Option      "Device" "/dev/tty00"
    Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5 6 7"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "kbd"
    Option      "XkbLayout" "de"
EndSection
</code></pre>
<p><code>wsmoused</code> works too (but must not be running when X does), it
needs these flags:</p>
<pre><code>-p /dev/cua00 -t microsoft
</code></pre>

				  <p>Sales and customer data provide important insight for companies. Analytics has today an important role in providing data about sales trends, customer profiles, warnings about (un)profitable products, sales volume forecasts and stock supply as well as personalizing customer relationships and giving product recommendations. All this information needs to be delivered in time, preferably in a (semi)automated fashion.<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/published/big-data-dashboard.jpg?1592856241" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <div><p><span size="3">Photo by Stephen Dawson on Unsplash</span></p></div>  <div><p>These data can become large to the point that analytical tools and software have performance issues. For example, many businesses embrace spreadsheet software like Excel for understandable reasons, but it would breakdown with large data. Many data scientist work with Python/R, but modules like Pandas would become slow and run out of memory with large data as well.</p><p>Apache Spark enables large and big data analyses. It does this by using parallel processing using different threads and cores optimally. It can therefore improve performance on a cluster but also on a single machine </p><p><span color="#5040ae">[1]</span>. It can do this for (i) unstructured data such as text or for (ii) structured data such as DataFrames arranged in columns. Spark does not require loading all data into memory before processing and it is faster than for example Hadoop.<br>Spark is a multi-language tool. Interfaces exist for Scala, Java, Python and R users, and it can be used in the cloud. These and other features make it a suitable platform for large scale data analyses. Google trends suggests that PySpark - Spark with a Python interface - enjoys increasing popularity.<br></p></div>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/google-trends_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p><span size="3"><span><span>Data source: <strong>Google Trends</strong> (https://www.<strong>google</strong>.com/<strong>trends</strong>).</span></span></span><br></p>  <div><p>The following blog shows a detailed short example using PySpark in the context of the Online retail sales data <span color="#5040ae">[2]</span>. These are data that are arranged in column format, containing for example invoice number, invoice dates, quantity, price and product description. The chosen data serve as an example and the size would still work in Pandas for most single machine users, even though it would be slower.</p><p>The current blog does not provide a benchmark as done previously </p><p><span color="#5040ae">[1]</span>. It rather gives hands-on analytical steps with code (i.e., concatenate data, removal of data records, renaming columns, replacing strings, casting data types, creation of new features, filtering data). It therefore allows a first glimpse into the world of PySpark.<br></p></div>  <div id="863076632288984095"><div><p id="element-4a5854cd-f009-4c87-9cfd-85ac90227db3" data-platform-element-id="919380649307043755-1.0.0">
	

<h2>START PYSPARK &amp; IMPORT MODULES</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The Jupyter notebook file <em>PySpark-retaildata.ipynb</em>&nbsp; can be found at GitHub <span color="#5040ae">[3]</span>.<br>The notebook can be run in Google Colab. To install PySpark, type in the first cell <span color="#8d7824">!pip install pyspark</span> .<br></p>  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/pyspark-install_orig.gif" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>An alternative is starting a Docker PySpark notebook <span color="#5040ae">[4]</span>.<br>After PySpark is installed and the Jupyter notebook is up and running, we first need to import the modules and create a Spark session:<br></p>      <p>Note that the Spark version used here is 2.4.5, which can be found by the command <span color="#8d7824">spark.version</span>. At the writing of this text, 3.0.0. is being released.<br></p>  <div id="540407624244840880"><div><p id="element-a3066edb-d72c-4553-8b52-740aa3d2f79d" data-platform-element-id="919380649307043755-1.0.0">
	

<h2>LOADING AND DISPLAYING THE DATA</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The Online retail data can be downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository <span color="#5040ae">[5]</span>. The data sheets should be converted to <em>online1.csv</em> and <em>online2.csv</em> to facilitate loading from disk. The command <span color="#8d7824">pwd</span> or <span color="#8d7824">os.getcwd()</span> can be used to find the current directory from which PySpark will load the files. Below it can be seen that PySpark only takes a couple of seconds whereas Pandas would take a couple of minutes on the same machine.<br></p>      <p><span size="2">Duration: 4.93 seconds</span><br></p>    <p><span size="2">Duration: 1.75 seconds</span><br></p>  <p>Size of the DataFrames (or shapes in terms of Pandas) can be obtained with the following code:<br></p>    <p>To have all the data together in one DataFrame, <em>df1</em> and <em>df2</em> will be concatenated vertically.<br></p>    <p>The following displays the first 5 rows. The command <span color="#8d7824">.limit(5)</span> will be used frequently throughout the text, which is comparable to the equivalent <span color="#8d7824">.head(5)</span> in Pandas, to set the number of rows that is displayed.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f1_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>This is the traditional Spark DataFrame output. By using the following setting we will get from now on a Pandas-like output.<br></p>    <p>A number of descriptive statistics can be obtained, like count, standard deviation, mean, minimum and maximum.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f2a_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>The table column <em>count</em> suggests that there are missing values in <em>Description</em> and <em>Customer ID</em>.

<h2>CHANGING NAME AND DATA TYPE</h2>
</p>
</div></div>  <p>The column name <em>Customer ID</em> contains an annoying white space that under certain circumstances can cause problems. So we should better rename that.<br></p>    <p>Further, the <em>Country</em> EIRE can be replaced by Ireland. The result can be verified by <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "Ireland").limit(5)</span><br></p>    <p>Information about the column type can be obtained. If you want some supplementary information,<span color="#8d7824"><span color="#2a2a2a"> an alternative command is</span></span> <span color="#8d7824">df.explain(df) </span>.<br></p>    <p><span size="2">StructType(List(StructField(Invoice,StringType,true),StructField(StockCode,StringType,true),StructField(Description,StringType,true),StructField(Quantity,IntegerType,true),StructField(InvoiceDate,StringType,true),StructField(Price,DoubleType,true),StructField(CustomerID,IntegerType,true),StructField(Country,StringType,true)))</span><br></p>  <p>Knowing the column types, we could now cast the column <em>Quantity</em> from integer to float.<br></p>    <p>The <em>InvoiceDate</em> shows up as a string. In order to exploit the time-related information, it would be best to convert it to date type. We will do this by creating a new column <em>n_InvoiceDate</em>.<br></p>    <p>Sorting the new dates, we can now display the number of records (rows) as a function of date and time.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f4_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It is also possible to display a range of dates. The following spots all sales at&nbsp;15 Jan 2010 from 8 till 10 o'clock.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f5_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>Time-serie analyses often require different units, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. For example, if we would like to display the sales per week, we could use the function <span color="#8d7824">weekofyear</span> that translates the date to week.<br></p>    <p>Multiple columns can be used in a computation. The total <em>Amount</em> a customer spent can be computed by multiplication of the <em>Price</em> of a single product with its <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f6_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>How to select rows with specific products? We can use the command <span color="#8d7824">isin</span>, which is very similar to the Pandas isin function:<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f7_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>If we want to search our data by key word, we would use the command <span color="#8d7824">like</span>.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f8_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>To find big buyers, probably organizational customers, select rows where <em>Quantity</em> is larger than 50000. Note that <span color="#8d7824">df.where(df.Quantity &gt; 50000)</span> would give a similar result.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f9_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Let us count the number of data records per country and sort the output, which shows that UK is clearly leading the list.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f10_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p><span color="#8d7824">Sort</span> can be used for <em>InvoiceDate</em> as well. This can show which hours customers purchase preferentially.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f11_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>    <p>Luckily, Spark supports SQL - Structured Query Language - which traditionally has an important role in managing relational databases. Using for example SQL queries, a subset of the data can be exported to CRM and KPI sales software. This offers a lot of flexibility for data analyses. Let us experiment with some very useful SQL queries, such as select and filter. We first need to register the DataFrame as a temporary table in the SQLContext. <br></p>    <p>We first select a couple of columns, for example <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em>. If you want to select all columns, simply use the star: <span color="#8d7824">spark.sql("select * from df").show(5)</span><br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f12_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em> and only those rows where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f13_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em>, <em>Quantity</em>, and <em>Country</em> where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6 and <em>country</em> is United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f14_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>SQL can also be used to show distinct (unique) values in a column. To limit space, only five are displayed here.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f15_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>And we can count the number of distinct values, that is how many countries are in total in the data.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f16_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Using SQL we can also exclude certain values. For example, exclude all records with United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f17_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It would be possible to add a new column that categorizes UK (1) or not-UK (0). You could then use <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "United Kingdom").limit(5)</span> and <span color="#8d7824">filter(df.Country == "France").limit(5)</span> to check if the column is correctly coding UK versus not-UK.<br></p>    <p>Next, we could count UK versus not-UK using the new column <em>Country_UK</em>.<br></p>    <p>And compute mean <em>Amount</em> and summed <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>      <div><p>That is it for now! In the current blog I have chosen to write out the code line by line. The code can of course be wrapped in several functions with the advantage that it can be used as a pre-processing script for different datasets, where you can set your own parameters. Further, smaller subsets of data can easily be exported and visualized in for ex. Plotly.</p><p>There are many other exciting features and developments in Spark:<br>1. Koalas is a Pandas API in Apache Spark, with similar capabilities but in a big data environment. This is particularly good news for people who already work in Pandas and need a quick translation to PySpark of their code.<br>2. Pandas UDF is a new feature that allows parallel processing on Pandas DataFrames.<br>3. There are excellent solutions using PySpark in the cloud. For example, AWS has big data platforms such as Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) that support PySpark.<br>4. Spark streaming allows real-time data analysis.<br>5.

July 21, 2020 | https://free.cofree.io/2020/07/20/perform-io/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://free.cofree.io/2020/07/20/perform-io/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        <p>Side effects break referential transparency. If you have a function <code>f</code> which has a pure type but performs
side effects behind closed doors (e.g., <code>f x = unsafePerformIO ...</code>), you’d have to be careful when refactoring the
code. You may want to, for instance, avoid changing <code>f x + f x</code> into <code>let y = f x in y + y</code>.</p>

<p>But even if you never make such substitutions yourself, the compiler may decide to step in and
do it for you. This post summarizes circumstances in which GHC may perform
optimizations that could change the behavior of your program, in the presence of non-referentially transparent
functions like <code>unsafePerformIO</code>, <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code>, and <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>. Hopefully this
helps you understand how to safely use them if you absolutely must do so.</p>

<p>By the way, the reason the title specifically features <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is twofold:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is the least safe of the three. Therefore, most if not all what
 I’m about to say that applies to <code>unsafePerformIO</code> and <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> is also applicable to <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>.</li>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is such a priceless name and I just couldn’t help myself.</li>
</ol>



<p>Here’s some useful background before we dive into the details. Some of the things GHC can do that alter the behaviors of
side-effectful functions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common subexpression elimination (CSE). CSE rewrites <code>f x + f x</code> into <code>let y = f x in y + y</code>, which may decrease
the number of times side effects are performed. CSE is turned on by default when compiling with <code>-O</code> and <code>-O2</code>, and can be
disabled with the <code>-fno-cse</code> flag.</li>
  <li>Full laziness optimization. The definition of full laziness is “every expression is evaluated at most once after the variables in
it have been bound”. This is achieved by floating bindings out of lambdas, for example, <code>f x = let y = g 42 in x + y</code>
is rewritten into <code>y = g 42; f x = x + y</code>. By floating <code>y = g 42</code> out of <code>f</code>, <code>g 42</code> is evaluated
at most once, which may also decrease the number of times side effects are performed. The original definition, on the other
hand, would evaluate <code>g 42</code> every time <code>f</code> is applied to an <code>x</code>. Full laziness is also turned on when compiling with <code>-O</code> and <code>-O2</code>, and can be
disabled with the <code>-fno-full-laziness</code> flag.</li>
  <li>Inlining. This has the opposite outcome with respect to side effects: inlining a side-effectful definition may cause
the side effect to be performed more times compared to not inlining it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth mentioning that these three things don’t act independently, but are related and sometimes interact with one another
in ways that can be really subtle, as the examples that follow shall demonstrate.</p>

<p>About the three unsafe functions covered in this post:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>unsafePerformIO</code> is the most well-known, and is relatively the safest, but the slowest of the three.</li>
  <li><code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> is faster but also less safe, in the sense that it provides
no guarantee that an <code>IO</code> action won’t be performed simultaneously by multiple threads.</li>
  <li><code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> (from the <code>bytestring</code> package) is even faster but much less safe. Not
only does it not check for duplicates, but it inlines everything, which makes CSE a lot more likely to
be triggered. It used to be called <code>inlinePerformIO</code>, but <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code> is an undeniably more
advisable name.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the following examples assume GHC 8.10.1 and <code>-O2</code>.</p>



<p>Let’s start with something simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>hasSideEffect 0</code> is obviously a common subexpression in the body of <code>main</code>. It would be factored out if CSE
is turned on, meaning “side effect!” would only be printed once. Passing <code>-fno-cse</code> to GHC makes it print twice.</p>

<p>Note that it doesn’t matter if <code>hasSideEffect</code> is inlined or not. <code>hasSideEffect 0</code> is a common subexpression
in either case.</p>



<p>The following example demonstrates the effect of the full laziness optimization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>g</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span>
             <span>in</span> <span>if</span> <span>y</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>then</span> <span>0</span> <span>else</span> <span>g</span> <span>(</span><span>y</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span>
   <span>in</span> <span>g</span> <span>5</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full laziness optimization causes “side effect!” to be only printed once. Although the value of
<code>n = hasSideEffect x</code> is used five times when evaluating <code>g 5</code>, <code>n</code> is only evaluated once, because
it is floated out of the body of <code>g</code>. If we disable full-laziness by passing <code>-fno-full-laziness</code>, you’d
see “side effect!” printed five times.</p>

<p>In this example there’s no common subexpression to eliminate, so disabling CSE has no effect.</p>



<p>Inlining, on the contrary, can increase the number of times a side effect is performed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>42</span>
<span>{-# NOINLINE hasSideEffect #-}</span>

<span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>y</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program prints “side effect!” once, which is usually what you want for having a constant value defined using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>.
Turning off CSE and/or full laziness does not change the behavior. If you change <code>{-# NOINLINE hasSideEffect #-}</code> to
<code>{-# INLINE hasSideEffect #-}</code>, then “side effect!” would be printed twice: once when evaluating <code>x</code> and once for <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>When there is neither an <code>INLINE</code> nor a <code>NOINLINE</code> pragma, GHC doesn’t seem to like inlining constants. It is, however, free
to do so. For constants that contain side effects, such as <code>hasSideEffect</code>, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the above example, it is
therefore almost always advisable to apply the <code>NOINLINE</code> pragma. In fact, HLint warns
against missing <code>NOINLINE</code> pragmas for constants defined using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>s. This advice, of course, isn’t
applicable to functions with <code>unsafePerformIO</code>s in their bodies. For a function like <code>f x = unsafePerformIO (... x ...)</code>, the
side effect needs to be performed whenever <code>f</code> is applied to an <code>x</code>, so it may as well be inlined.</p>



<p>Consider this program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>Main</span> <span>where</span>
<span>import</span> <span>System.IO.Unsafe</span>

<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>unsafePerformIO</span> <span>$</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"side effect!"</span>
  <span>pure</span> <span>x</span>

<span>f</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>f</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>g</span> <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>y</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span>
      <span>{-# INLINE g #-}</span>
   <span>in</span> <span>g</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>g</span> <span>1</span>

<span>main</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program prints “side effect!” just once, whether <code>g</code> is inlined or not inlined. In order to make “side effect!”
print twice, you need to disable CSE if <code>g</code> is inlined, but disable
full laziness if <code>g</code> is not inlined. Let’s study why this is the case.</p>

<p>If <code>g</code> is inlined, <code>g 0 + g 1</code> becomes</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>hasSideEffect</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>z</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>hasSideEffect x</code> is a common subexpression, so it is factored out by CSE, causing “side effect!” to be printed
just once. In this case the inlining happened in a simplifier pass before the full laziness pass (which can be
observed from the output of <code>-dshow-passes</code>), and therefore, the full laziness pass didn’t have the opportunity
to float <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> out of <code>g</code> before <code>g</code> was inlined. This is why turning off
full laziness has no effect, but turning off CSE does.</p>

<p>If <code>g</code> is not inlined, on the other hand, there would be no common subexpression to eliminate.
Instead, the full laziness pass would float <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> out of <code>g</code>. This is why turning off
CSE has no effect, but turning off full laziness does.</p>

<p>It is also possible to make it so that <em>both</em> <code>-fno-cse</code> and <code>-fno-full-laziness</code> are needed in order for
“side effect!” to be printed twice. For example, try <code>{-# NOINLINE [2] g #-}</code>. This is because</p>
<ul>
  <li>If full-laziness is turned on, <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code> would be floated out of <code>g</code> <em>before</em> inlining (because we told
GHC to avoid inlining until after phase 2, which comes after the full laziness pass). After <code>z = hasSideEffect x</code>
is floated out, it would <em>not</em> subsequently be inlined, and therefore “side effect!” is only printed once.</li>
  <li>If CSE is turned on, it would happen <em>after</em> inlining. Since inlining enables CSE to “see” the common
subexpression <code>hasSideEffect x</code>, it is factored out, and therefore “side effect!” is only printed once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply put, in this case inlining happens after the full-laziness pass but before the CSE pass, and this means
you need to turn them both off for the side effect to be performed twice.</p>

<p>This example shows that the interaction between CSE, full-laziness and inlining can be subtle. If your
program uses <code>unsafePerformIO</code> or similar unsafe functions, the simplest way to ensure that the behavior is easily predictable
is to either <code>NOINLINE</code> everything and turn off both CSE and full-laziness, or compile the program with <code>-O0</code>.
You don’t really want to do either of them because they both kill performance, so it really pays to understand the nuances so that you lose as little performance as possible while ensuring the program behaves as expected.</p>



<p>Using <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> instead of <code>unsafePerformIO</code> is another way to potentially make an IO action
perform more times than intended. This is slightly off topic since it is about concurrency rather than GHC modifying
your program, but since <code>unsafeDupablePerformIO</code> falls in between the relatively safe <code>unsafePerformIO</code> and the
extremely unsafe <code>accursedUnutterablePerformIO</code>, I reckon it is worth mentioning.</p>

<p>A thunk is usually evaluated only once. When a thread attempts to force a thunk, and that thunk is already being
evaluated by another thread, the first thread would usually block rather than evaluating the thunk again. This is
achieved using a technique called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/2005-haskell.pdf">blackholing</a>.
Blackholing is by default lazy, but an eager option is possible via flag <code>-feager-blackholing</code>, which guarantees
that no thunk is evaluated more than once (with a slight performance penalty).</p>

<p>If a thunk is built using <code>unsafePerformIO</code>, then even if the thunk is evaluated by more than one thread
in parallel, the IO …</p></div></div>

GPT-3 is a natural language model that, given some examples, tries to predict appropriate text output for a given text input. Since code is just text, there's the question of whether it can be used to produce code based only on a description of what the code should do. And, amazing world that we live in, there are already some early<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 49 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" data-reactid="50">tech demos</a><!-- react-text: 51 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 52 -->of exactly that.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="54">A common off-the-cuff reaction to such demos is that this sort of technology will inevitably make Software Engineers obsolete, because if an AI can produce more or less what they produce, then seemingly we won't need to pay them to do it anymore.</p><p data-reactid="55">The reasoning for these kinds of claims is understandable. If your premise is that a Software Engineer's job is to take a description of what some software should do, and write code to implement that, then it makes sense to view technology like this as a drop-in replacement.</p><p data-reactid="56">But that's not right. What a Software Engineer really does is build software solutions to solve problems appropriately. That seems like a subtle distinction, but it's a really important one. Code is not the solution, it's the implementation of a solution. The solution certainly requires that code be written, hence the ability to write code. But going the other direction, the ability to write code does not imply the ability to create appropriate solutions to problems.</p><p data-reactid="57">I think because writing code is intrinsically a difficult skill which is opaque and unfamiliar to outsiders, it appears like the hard part of building software is in fact writing code. But it really isn't, and that's the point. The hard part is solving the problem appropriately. Implementing that solution in code once you have it is comparatively easy.</p><p data-reactid="58">This is counter-intuitive, and I don't think it's something that can be fully appreciated without having gone through the process of building software yourself. Without this insight, it does indeed seem like an AI writing code opens up the possibility of generalists building software, just by describing their ideas. But that's no more true than saying that hiring a skilled ghost writer opens up the possibility for anybody with a story idea to write a great novel.</p><p data-reactid="60">So, I understand the basis of these claims from an outsider's perspective. They are reasonable given the premises they're based on. What does surprise me a bit, though, is the common rebuttals that seem to come up from insiders - Software Engineers themselves.</p><p data-reactid="61">There are two main forms. The first is "this will never work": pointing out all the technical difficulties of such a thing in practice. The other is "it's all just code anyway": the notion that the natural language description of any software past a certain point of complexity would have to be structured and formalised to the extent that it basically becomes code.</p><p data-reactid="62"><!-- react-text: 63 -->I find these rebuttals surprising not because they're necessarily wrong. They're actually very practical - the thing has to basically work before the rest of the conversation is relevant, after all, and we're still a very long way from that. I find them surprising more just because they meet the claims at their own level, seeming to implicitly accept their premise. They say "this is wrong because AI won't be able to meaningfully write code" rather than "this is wrong because when AI<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 64 --> <!-- /react-text --><span data-reactid="65">can</span><!-- react-text: 66 --> meaningfully write code, far from making Software Engineers obsolete, it will help them".<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="67">The reason I'd expect more Software Engineers to hold the latter view is because there's really nothing new here. I guess using AI to produce code looks like some giant leap at first glance, but it's really more a linear progression of something that's been happening in the software industry since day one - using software to automate writing software. Tools and frameworks that improve efficiency in building software by automating more and more of the heavy lifting are something that every Software Engineer is familiar with, and it's understood that they're unequivocally a good thing. Why should an AI writing code be any different?</p><p data-reactid="68">Furthermore, it's established at this point that such tools do not lead to less need for Software Engineers, because there is not a fixed limit of demand for software to be built. Rather, they allow more and better software to be built faster, opening new opportunities to apply software solutions where they weren't previously economical, growing the software industry and actually increasing the value of the skillset needed to build software, which again, is not the same thing as the ability to write code.</p><p data-reactid="70">Software Engineers should welcome every advancement that brings forward AI tools that assist in writing larger and more meaningful parts of our code. This isn't something to resist, but something to push forward, because far from making Software Engineers obsolete, these tools will further leverage the skills they have that are most valuable.</p><p data-reactid="71">And come on, who likes typing anyway?</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most harmful behaviors I’ve observed in ineffective leadership is a tendency to add chaos when one enters a room. Chaos comes in many flavors: A decision was reached about an important architecture question weeks ago, but someone suddenly insists that you revisit the project’s fundamental goals at the 11th hour. An executive insists that their project is most important, and pushes it onto the roadmap. Or maybe you leave a productive meeting without concrete next steps, and are right back where you started in a week.</p>

<h3 id="great-leaders-vacuum-up-chaos">Great leaders vacuum up chaos</h3>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/chaos/tasmanian-devil.jpg" alt="Tasmanian devil going crazy">
Nobody is excited when this guy enters the room</p>

<p>My litmus test for effective leadership: any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. They remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not them. They’re able to not only stop bad plans before it’s too late, but get them moving again in the right direction.</p>

<p>Usually, chaos-causing behavior is unintentional and comes from a good place. Often people are just missing context, or haven’t developed a rhythm for making sure that projects and plans stay organized. In rare cases, it can arise for less savory reasons: someone wants to flex on others by diverting a conversation to a favorite topic or forcing a change of plans.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-source-of-stability">Be a source of stability</h3>

<p>I’ve been guilty of causing my share of unnecessary chaos, and have always regretted it. However, I was fortunate enough to also have a number of teammates who weren’t shy about calling me out for this over the years. I’ve since built a grab bag of practices on how to be better:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strive for measurable outcomes, and frequently reinforce the goals of what you’re working on even if it’s repetitive. For example, if you’re trying to increase conversions from your login page, be clear about why this is important and how you’ll measure success.</li>
  <li><a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/05/05/Running-Meetings.html">Insist that all meetings have agendas</a>. Don’t overthink this – a single bullet like “decide what color to make the login button” is fine. A shocking proportion of seemingly simple meetings will wander without this, and it only takes 30 seconds. Don’t let people waste your time, or their own.</li>
  <li>Confirm in-person decisions that were complicated, non-intuitive, or contentious in writing: “We decided the login button should be neon pink so that it really stands out from the blue page background.”</li>
  <li>Use documents for complex decisions. It’s easier to catch when a document is off-track, because unlike a conversation you can see the entire arc of the discussion at once. The decision to make the login button pink should live in a document or ticket.</li>
  <li>When in doubt, over-communicate. Say what you’re planning to do next, so that work doesn’t get duplicated: “I’m going to add this decision on the login button to our design document.” If you’re not going to do something, confirm that as well: “I’m not going to update our design mockups, so if anyone thinks that we’ll need that, speak up now.”</li>
  <li>Avoid using power or appeals to authority to sidestep teams’ processes for prioritization. This is important for teams that you manage, and especially important when working with other teams. <a href="https://staysaasy.com/process/2020/04/06/Creating-Good-Process.html">Good lightweight processes</a> are one of the best ways to add efficiency to a team, and breaking them is akin to removing the oil from your car. If you must break processes, make sure to explain why.</li>
  <li>If a plan seems strange, ask questions to understand “why” before asking anyone to change the course of action. If you think that you’re going to need to ask someone to change plans, try to ask at least one extra clarifying question or wait 5 minutes longer in the conversation before reacting.</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: <em>The fancier your title, the more you must avoid causing chaos</em>. If Bob the Intern frantically flip-flops on the plan for his summer project, people will patiently help him towards a good path and perhaps make sure he has less caffeine tomorrow. If Bob the CEO flip-flops on his strategy, people will capsize the ship trying to enact his will. Remove chaos and you and your team will be happier and more successful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/all%20together%20now_wide.jpg" alt="Grafana, InfluxDB and CollectD"></p><h4 id="for-some-companies-infrastructure-is-the-heart-of-its-business-specifically-i-am-referring-to-those-companies-which-need-to-manage-data-and-applications-located-on-more-than-one-server">For some companies, infrastructure is the heart of its business. Specifically, I am referring to those companies which need to manage data and applications located on more than one server.</h4><p>It is essential for a company to monitor its infrastructure nodes, especially if the company does not have on-site access to intervene when issues arise. In fact, the intensive use of some resources can be an indication of malfunctioning or overcrowding. However, in addition to prevention, monitoring could be used to assess possible implications of new software in the production environment. Currently, there are several “ready-to-use” solutions on the market to keep track of all the resources consumed. These solutions, which appear reasonable, present two key problems: the high price of setup and security issues related to third parties.</p><p>The first problem is related to cost. Prices vary from 10 euros per month up to thousands depending on how many hosts you need to monitor — with the former being consumer pricing and the latter being enterprise pricing. So, for example, let’s imagine that I have three nodes to monitor during the course of a year. At 10 euros per month, I would spend 120 euros. For smaller enterprises, where the price can range between 10,000 and 20,000 euro per year, such an expense can bloat its underlying cost structure and become financially untenable.</p><p>The second problem is third party risk. Typically, infrastructure data must pass through a third party company in order to be seen and analysed for the customer — whether that be an individual consumer or an enterprise. How does the third party company capture the data and then present it to the customer? Simply put, the third party company often collects data through a custom agent that is installed onto a node and monitored. Quite often is it found that this installation is not up-to-date and compatible with operating systems. Previous work has been done by security researchers who cast light upon problems with <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/misc/nagios_nrpe_arguments">“proprietary collectors”</a>. Would you trust them? I would not.</p><p>In keeping nodes for both <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide">Tor</a> and some <a href="https://getmonero.org/">cryptocurrencies</a>, I prefer to opt for a cost free, easy to configure, and open-source alternative. Here, we will use the triad: Grafana, InfluxDB, and CollectD.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-graphs.png" alt="An example of a Grafana dashboard"></p><h2 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h2><p>In order to be able to analyse every metric of our infrastructure, it is necessary to use a program capable of capturing statistics on the machines we want to monitor. In this regard, <a href="https://collectd.org/">CollectD</a> comes to your aid: it is a daemon that groups and collects (hence the name) all the parameters that can be stored on disk or sent over the network.</p><p>The data will be transmitted to an instance of <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>: a particular time series database that associates to each data the time (coded in UNIX timestamp) in which the server received it. In this way, the data sent by CollectD will already be set in a temporal way, as a succession of events.</p><p>Finally, you will use <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> which will connect to InfluxDB to create flashy dashboards to display the data in a user-friendly way. Through histograms and graphs of every kind, it will be possible to observe in real time all the data related to CPU, RAM, etc.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana-diagram.png" alt="Grafana infrastructure"></p><h2 id="influxdb">InfluxDB</h2><picture>
<source media="(min-width: 535px)" data-original-set="/images/grafana/db_alone.jpg 1x,

InfluxDB is a time series database <a href="https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb">open-source</a> developed in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> to store data as a sequence of events.</p><p>Each time data is added, it is linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">a UNIX timestamp</a> by default. This allows enormous flexibility for the user who no longer has to worry about saving, as an example, the “time” variable, which is sometimes cumbersome to configure. Let’s imagine we have several machines located in a number of continents. How do we manage the “time” variable? Do we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich</a> meridian for all the data? Or do we set a different time zone for each node? If data is saved on different time zones, how can we accurately display the graphs? As you can see, this can be very complicated.</p><p>As a time-aware database that automatically timestamps any data point, InfluxDB has the advantage of simultaneously being able to write to a certain database. This is why we often imagine InfluxDB as a timeline. Writing data does not affect the performance of the database (as sometimes happens in MySQL), since writing is simply the addition of a certain event to the timeline. The name of the program derives precisely from the conception of time as an infinite and indefinite “flow” that flows.</p><h3 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h3><p>Another advantage of InflxuDB is the <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/introduction/install/">ease of installation</a> and the extensive <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/">documentation</a> provided by the community that widely supports the project. It has two types of interfaces: via <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/">Command Line</a> (which is powerful and flexible for developers, but poorly prepared to see large amounts of data) and an <a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/guides/write_data/#sidebar">HTTP API</a> that allows direct communication with the database.</p><p>InfluxDB can be downloaded not only from the official website, but also from the package manager of the distribution (in this example we use a Debian system).

By default, CollectD captures metrics on CPU, RAM, memory (on disk), network interfaces, processes, etc. The potential of the program is endless, given that it can be extended with a preinstalled <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins">plugin enablement</a> or through the <a href="https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmap#Wishlist_.2F_Ideas">creation of new ones</a>.</p><p>As you can see, installing CollectD is simple:</p><p>In a simplistic manner, let’s illustrate how CollectD works. Suppose that I want to check how many processes my node has. In doing so, CollectD does nothing more than make an API call to get the number of processes per time unit (defined as 5000 ms, by default). Once captured, the data will be sent to InfluxDB via a module (called “Network”) to be configured.</p><p>Open the file <code>/etc/collectd.conf</code> with our editor, scroll to find the <code>Network</code> section, and edit as written in the following snippet. Be sure to specify the IP where the interface of InfluxDB (<code>INFLUXDB_IP</code>) is located.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6a1805051e2a04050e0f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>#~: nano /etc/collectd.conf

    ...</code></pre></div><p>My suggestion is to modify, within the configuration, the hostname that is sent to InfluxDB (which in our infrastructure is a “centralized” database, since it resides on a single node). In doing so, the data will not be redundant and there is no risk that other nodes will overwrite the information.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/tres_caballeros.jpg" alt="Three daemon"></p><h2 id="grafana">Grafana</h2><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/grafana/grafana_alone.jpg" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>A graph is worth thousand of images</p></blockquote><p>In remembrance of this famous “quote”, observing the infrastructure metrics live through graphs and tables enables us to act in an efficient and timely manner. To create and configure the dashboard, we will use Grafana.</p><p>Grafana is an open-source tool, compatible with a wide range of databases (including InfluxDB), that presents a graphical representation of metrics and allows a user to create alerts if a particular piece of data meets a condition. For example, if your CPU reaches high peaks, you can be notified on Slack, Mattermost, by email, etc. In fact, I have personally configured an alert every time someone enters SSH, so I can actively monitor who “enters” my infrastructure.</p><p>Grafana does not require any special settings: once again, it is InfluxDB that “scans” the “time” variable.

<p>Either you’ve already heard of <code>pandoc</code> or if you have searched online for <code>markdown</code> to <code>pdf</code> or similar, you are sure to come across <code>pandoc</code>. This tutorial will help you use <code>pandoc</code> to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> from a <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub style markdown</a> file. The main motivation for this blog post is to highlight what customizations I did to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> versions for <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/books/">self-publishing my ebooks</a>. It wasn’t easy to arrive at the set-up I ended up with, so I hope this will be useful for those looking to use <code>pandoc</code> to generate <code>pdf</code> and <code>epub</code> formats. This guide is specifically aimed at technical books that has code snippets.</p>



<h2 id="installation"><a name="installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<p>I use Ubuntu, as far as I remember, the below steps are enough to work for the demos in this tutorial. If you get an error or warning, search that issue online and you’ll likely find what else has to be installed.</p>

<p>I first downloaded <code>deb</code> file from <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases">pandoc: releases</a> and installed it. Followed by packages needed for <code>pdf</code> generation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># latest pandoc version as of 21 July 2010 is 2.10</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>gdebi ~/Downloads/pandoc-2.10-1-amd64.deb

<span>$ </span><span># note that download size is 750+ MB</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>texlive-xetex
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>librsvg2-bin
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>texlive-math-extra
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more details and guide for other OS, refer to <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">pandoc: installation</a></p>



<h2 id="minimal-example"><a name="minimal-example"></a>Minimal example</h2>

<p>Once <code>pandoc</code> is working on your system, try generating a sample <code>pdf</code> without any customization.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/learnbyexample.github.io/tree/master/files/pandoc_pdf">learnbyexample.github.io repo</a> for all the input and output files referred in this tutorial.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc sample_1.md <span>-f</span> gfm <span>-o</span> sample_1.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here <code>sample_1.md</code> is input markdown file and <code>-f</code> is used to specify that the input format is GitHub style markdown. The <code>-o</code> option specifies the output file type based on extension. The default output is probably good enough. But I wished to customize hyperlinks, inline code style, add page breaks between chapters, etc. This blog post will discuss these customizations one by one.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> <code>pandoc</code> has its own flavor of <code>markdown</code> with many useful extensions — see <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">pandoc: pandocs-markdown</a> for details. GitHub style markdown is recommended if you wish to use the same source (or with minor changes) in multiple places.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/info.svg" alt="info"> It is advised to use <code>markdown</code> headers in order without skipping — for example, <code>H1</code> for chapter heading and <code>H2</code> for chapter sub-section, etc is fine. <code>H1</code> for chapter heading and <code>H3</code> for sub-section is not. Using the former can give automatic index navigation on ebook readers.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a> reader, the index navigation for above sample looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/chapter_index.png" alt="Chapter Index"></p>



<h2 id="chapter-breaks"><a name="chapter-breaks"></a>Chapter breaks</h2>

<p>As observed from previous demo, by default there are no chapter breaks. Searching for a <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/601469/getting-chapters-to-start-on-a-new-page-in-a-pandoc-generated-pdf">solution online</a>, I got this piece of <code>tex</code> code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>sectsty<span>}</span>
<span>\sectionfont</span><span>{</span><span>\clearpage</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be added using <code>-H</code> option. From <code>pandoc</code> manual,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-H FILE, –include-in-header=FILE</p>

  <p>Include  contents  of FILE, verbatim, at the end of the header.  This
can be used, for example, to include special  CSS  or  JavaScript  in
HTML documents.  This option can be used repeatedly to include multiple
files in the header.  They will be included in the  order  specified.
Implies –standalone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>pandoc</code> invocation now looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc sample_1.md <span>-f</span> gfm <span>-H</span> chapter_break.tex <span>-o</span> sample_1_chapter_break.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can add further customization to headings, for example use <code>\sectionfont{\underline\clearpage}</code> to underline chapter names or <code>\sectionfont{\LARGE\clearpage}</code> to allow chapter names to get even bigger. Here’s some more links to read about various customizations:</p>

<ul>

</ul>



<h2 id="changing-settings-via--v-option"><a name="changing-settings-via--v-option"></a>Changing settings via -V option</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>-V KEY[=VAL], –variable=KEY[:VAL]</p>

  <p>Set the template variable KEY to the value  VAL  when  rendering  the
document  in standalone mode.  This is generally only useful when the
–template option is used to specify a custom template, since  pandoc
automatically  sets  the variables used in the default templates.  If
no VAL is specified, the key will be given the value true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>-V</code> option allows to change variable values to customize settings like page size, font, link color, etc. As more settings are changed, better to use a simple script to call <code>pandoc</code> instead of typing the whole command on terminal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

pandoc <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-f</span> gfm <span>\</span>
    <span>--include-in-header</span> chapter_break.tex <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> linkcolor:blue <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> geometry:a4paper <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> geometry:margin<span>=</span>2cm <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> <span>mainfont</span><span>=</span><span>"DejaVu Serif"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-V</span> <span>monofont</span><span>=</span><span>"DejaVu Sans Mono"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--pdf-engine</span><span>=</span>xelatex <span>\</span>
    <span>-o</span> <span>"</span><span>$2</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>mainfont</code> is for normal text</li>
  <li><code>monofont</code> is for code snippets</li>
  <li><code>geometry</code> for page size and margins</li>
  <li><code>linkcolor</code> to set hyperlink color</li>
  <li>to increase default <strong>font size</strong>, use <code>-V fontsize=12pt</code>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23811002/from-markdown-to-pdf-how-to-change-the-font-size-with-pandoc">stackoverflow: change font size</a> if you need even bigger size options</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>xelatex</code> as the <code>pdf-engine</code> allows to use any font installed in the system. One reason I chose <code>DejaVu</code> was because it supported <strong>Greek</strong> and other Unicode characters that were causing error with other fonts. See <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/21736/using-xelatex-instead-of-pdflatex">tex.stackexchange: Using XeLaTeX instead of pdfLaTeX</a> for some more details.</p>

<p>The <code>pandoc</code> invocation is now through a script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>chmod</span> +x md2pdf.sh
<span>$ </span>./md2pdf.sh sample_1.md sample_1_settings.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do compare the pdf generated side by side with previous output before proceeding.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/warning.svg" alt="warning"> On my system, <code>DejaVu Serif</code> did not have <em>italic</em> variation installed, so I had to use <code>sudo apt install ttf-dejavu-extra</code> to get it.</p>



<h2 id="syntax-highlighting"><a name="syntax-highlighting"></a>Syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>One option to customize syntax highlighting for code snippets is to save one of the <code>pandoc</code> themes and editing it. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30880200/pandoc-what-are-the-available-syntax-highlighters/47876166#47876166">stackoverflow: What are the available syntax highlighters?</a> for available themes and more details (as a good practice on stackoverflow, go through all answers and comments — the linked/related sections on sidebar are useful as well).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>pandoc <span>--print-highlight-style</span><span>=</span>pygments <span>&gt;</span> pygments.theme
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Edit the above file to customize the theme. Use sites like <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/">colorhexa</a> to help with color choices, hex values, etc. For this demo, the below settings are changed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># by default, background is same as normal text
# change it to a shade of gray to easily distinguish code and text
"background-color": "#f8f8f8",

# change italic to false, messes up comments with slashes
# change comment text-color to yet another shade of gray
"Comment": {
    "text-color": "#9c9c9c",
    "background-color": null,
    "bold": false,
    "italic": false,
    "underline": false
},
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Inline code</strong></p>

<p>Similar to changing background color for code snippets, I found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40975004/pandoc-latex-change-backtick-highlight">solution online</a> to change background color for inline code snippets.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>fancyvrb,newverbs,xcolor<span>}</span>

<span>\definecolor</span><span>{</span>Light<span>}{</span>HTML<span>}{</span>F4F4F4<span>}</span>

<span>\let\oldtexttt\texttt</span>
<span>\renewcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\texttt</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span>
  <span>\colorbox</span><span>{</span>Light<span>}{</span><span>\oldtexttt</span><span>{</span>#1<span>}}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add <code>--highlight-style pygments.theme</code> and <code>--include-in-header inline_code.tex</code> to the script and generate the <code>pdf</code> again.</p>

<p>With <code>pandoc sample_2.md -f gfm -o sample_2.pdf</code> the output would be:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/default_syn.png" alt="Default syntax highlighting"></p>

<p>With <code>./md2pdf_syn.sh sample_2.md sample_2_syn.pdf</code> the output is:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/customized_syn.png" alt="Customized syntax highlighting"></p>



<p>For my <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions">Python re(gex)?</a> book, by chance I found that using <code>ruby</code> instead of <code>python</code> for REPL code snippets syntax highlighting was better. Snapshot from <code>./md2pdf_syn.sh sample_3.md sample_3.pdf</code> result is shown below. For <code>python</code> directive, string output gets treated as a comment and color for boolean values isn’t easy to distinguish from string values. The <code>ruby</code> directive treats string value as expected and boolean values are easier to spot.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/python_vs_ruby_syn.png" alt="REPL syntax highlighting"></p>



<h2 id="bullet-styling"><a name="bullet-styling"></a>Bullet styling</h2>

<p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22156999/how-to-change-the-style-of-bullets-in-pandoc-markdown">stackoverflow Q&amp;A</a> helped for bullet styling.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>enumitem<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>amsfonts<span>}</span>

<h2 id="adding-table-of-contents"><a name="adding-table-of-contents"></a>Adding table of contents</h2>

<p>There’s a handy option <code>--toc</code> to automatically include table of contents at top of the generated <code>pdf</code>. You can control number of levels using <code>--toc-depth</code> option, the default is 3 levels. You can also change the default string <code>Contents</code> to something else using <code>-V toc-title</code> option.</p>

<p><code>./md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc.sh sample_1.md sample_1_toc.pdf</code> gives:</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/pandoc_pdf/table_of_contents.png" alt="table of contents"></p>



<h2 id="adding-cover-image"><a name="adding-cover-image"></a>Adding cover image</h2>

<p>To add something prior to table of contents, cover image for example, you can use a <code>tex</code> file and include it verbatim. Create a <code>tex</code> file (named as <code>cover.tex</code> here) with content as shown below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\includegraphics</span><span>{</span>cover.png<span>}</span>
<span>\thispagestyle</span><span>{</span>empty<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, modify the previous script <code>md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc.sh</code> by adding <code>--include-before-body cover.tex</code> and tada — you get the cover image before table of contents. <code>\thispagestyle{empty}</code> helps to avoid page number on the cover page, see also <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/360739/what-is-the-use-of-clearpage-thispagestyleempty-cleardoublepage">tex.stackexchange: clear page</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>bash</code> script invocation is now <code>./md2pdf_syn_bullet_prop_toc_cover.sh sample_5.md sample_5.pdf</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/images/warning.svg" alt="warning"> You’ll need at least one image in input markdown file, otherwise settings won’t apply to the cover image and you may end up with weird output. <code>sample_5.md</code> used in the command above includes an image. And be careful to use escapes if the image path can contain <code>tex</code> metacharacters.</p>



<h2 id="stylish-blockquote"><a name="stylish-blockquote"></a>Stylish blockquote</h2>

<p>By default, blockquotes (lines starting with <code>&gt;</code> in markdown) are just indented in the <code>pdf</code> output. To make them standout, <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154528/how-to-change-the-background-color-and-border-of-a-pandoc-generated-blockquote">tex.stackexchange: change the background color and border of blockquote</a> helped.</p>

    <p>Mailinator started 17 years ago as a weekend project to define the idea of “Free, Disposable, Email”. Back then, it ran on a single server with only a single developer. Over time, it’s popularity has exploded in terms of both incoming email and active users. As you might guess when you go from thousands of emails-per-day to <strong>thousands of emails-per-second</strong>, the behind-the-scenes technical stack needs to evolve - and Mailinator’s stack has had a quite a technical journey.</p>
<p><img src="https://manybrain.github.io/m8r_blog/img/2020/07/image1.png" alt="Slide showing beginning and end tech evolution for Mailinator.com"></p>
<p>Today Mailinator still provides free, disposable, email - but also serves thousands of daily corporate users in testing their Email and SMS Workflows with an API, Webhooks, and Private Domains. Website owners quickly realized that having an infinite number of inboxes “on tap” was incredibly useful for testing things their like their Signup system, Marketing email systems, and more. Quality Assurance teams found it to be an invaluable tool.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Mailinator’s creator Paul Tyma gave a talk on the “Technical Evolution of Mailinator.com”. Below you can find a link to the slides and watch the video. The talk explores the site’s journey from a “Free, Disposable, Email” to a becoming SaaS service helping thousands of companies test their Email and SMS Workflows (and of course, scaling a system to tens of millions of emails per day).</p>

July 21, 2020 | https://blog.palabra.io/how-to-send-a-confirmation-email-when-someone-submits-a-webflow-form?ref=hackernews | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.palabra.io/how-to-send-a-confirmation-email-when-someone-submits-a-webflow-form?ref=hackernews">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you have a landing page or website created in Webflow, chances are you added some sort of contact form to reach interested users or prospects. Nothing gives your site more validation than people leaving their contact information, so you'll probably want to use that to make the most out of your site's traffic.</p><p>In this short article we'll show you how to send automated <strong>emails when someone submits a Webflow form</strong> using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.palabra.io/">Palabra</a>.</p><p>But why send just one email? We'll show you how to set up an entire automated sequence to welcome and engage your prospects using a no-code tool in just 5 minutes.</p><p><em>Note: Pretty obvious, but you need to have an existing Webflow site including a form to use this guide. You can learn how to do that <a href="https://university.webflow.com/article/intro-to-forms">here</a>.</em></p><h3>Step 1: Create an email trigger from a Webflow form</h3><p>To start, create a trigger and add a condition. Select "User submitted a form on Webflow" to set up the integration.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="1.png" title="1.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/7d769/1.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/5243c/1.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/ab158/1.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/7d769/1.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/dda0a44008c569addd2daa6c9ee571dd/b43a1/1.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><h3>Step 2: Connect your Webflow site to Palabra</h3><p>After you select the trigger, click on the card and give Palabra access to your Webflow website. Then pick from the list the website where you have the form you want to connect:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="2.png" title="2.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/7d769/2.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/5243c/2.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/ab158/2.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/7d769/2.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/be36ec5cf8f8f440f7258b253580a23a/2b72d/2.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>You'll need your Webflow form to include an email input to trigger the sequence. If you don't have one, just add it to your Webflow site and then select "Test connection again".</p><h3>Step 3: Select your email sequence</h3><p>In the "Tasks" column, you can add an email from the template list, or add a specific action, like wait some time.</p><p>Here you can select different actions and set up a whole sequence. For this example I created a simple welcoming sequence for a Webflow landing page to a community:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="3.png" title="3.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/7d769/3.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/5243c/3.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/ab158/3.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/7d769/3.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/e8060f3f497f85bbddfd273b36bf9952/b1884/3.png 994w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>In this example I would be welcoming prospects to my community, sending them some resources the next day, and then waiting a few days to ask for feedback.</p><p>You can easily edit any template by clicking on each card. It will save automatically.</p><h3>Step 4: Start sending automated emails</h3><p>This step is really really short. Once you are ready, just click "Start actions" and wait for Palabra to do the work for you.</p><p>And that's it. You already automated a welcoming sequence. Congratulations.</p><h4>Pro tip: Try out different sequences</h4><p>Once you get your sequence going, you will find a third column with your sequence's performance. You'll get a full list of contacts that received each email, and stats to know who opened them and who clicked on your call to action:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="4.png" title="4.png" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/96430/4.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/5243c/4.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/ab158/4.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/72e8c4e1d2051060a2d8206508a066a4/96430/4.png 933w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Try out changing your templates or the order in which emails get sent to see if your open ratio improves.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this tutorial! If you are curious about what else you can do with Palabra or would just like to try it go ahead an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.palabra.io/">create an account here</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions just send us a quick email, we'll be more than happy to hear your thoughts!</p><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed this tutorial!

            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Anything worth doing, is worth doing well.</li>
                <li><i>Everything</i> that gets added to your product should be considered.</li>
                <li>There is never a time when you should be O.K to just “add a button”. Someone in the process should have thought deeply about it, or you should have. It’s the only way to create lasting products.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you agree with the above, let’s continue on this journey. If not <a href="https://twitter.com/philipardeljan">tweet me</a> or comment below :)</p>

            <p>Doing lots of things quickly feels good. It's human nature. Cranking out work gives an outward semblance of progress. In the context of product design however, an expression comes to mind:</p>

            <blockquote><h3>"Quiet, calm deliberation disentangles every knot"</h3></blockquote>
            <blockquote><small>Gilbert and Sullivan</small></blockquote>

            <p>As product designers, we are tasked with solving difficult problems. To solve these problems our initial inclination can be to design a fancy new interface. At times, the result of good design can be making no change at all or even removing something entirely.</p>

            <p>The main challenge with adding things to a product is that after some time, people expect it to always be there. There is so much inertia once something is in place and is being used. You can’t remove it easily. This is why adding something in the first place is such an important decision. With user interface design, quality is better than quantity. You can only fit so much onto a screen at any given time so difficult decisions need to be made.</p>

            <blockquote><h3>"Just add in this button"</h3></blockquote>
            <blockquote><small>A co-worker, probably</small></blockquote>

            <p>Sometimes I think about a small piece of UI for a long time. And a lot of the time it feels unproductive. It feels so weird to spend half a day thinking deeply about a button. But the presence of <i>one more button</i> within a user interface could make or break it.</p>

            <h3>UI scenario: Add a button to this screen to let users do (x).</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Does this button need to exist in the UI? (despite being mandated I always consider this first. As an interface designer, you are responsible to ensure the interface works for users first.)</li>
                <li>Do all users need to see it, or just a subset or users?</li>
                <li>Does the button have more or less importance than the elements around it?</li>
                <li>Does adding this button distract too much from the existing functions?</li>
                <li>With all of this in mind, have I struck the right balance?</li>
                <li>How does the information architecture hold up?</li>
                <li>What existing UI patterns do we have for this button (if any)?</li>
                <li>Does this button need to persist after being actioned once/twice/etc?</li>
                <li>Does this button have multiple states? If so, what are they?</li>
                <li>Does it need to be touch friendly and have a big tap target?</li>
                <li>Will this element animate? Where from/to? Why?</li>
                <li>and so on…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a considered approach to UI design. It will ensure that the user always has the best experience when using your product. The compounding effects of strong design decisions quickly stack up. Kind of like compounding interest.</p>

            <h3>UX scenario: The user should be able to do (x).</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How does the user currently do (x)? </li>
                <li>Is the user having to use a workaround to do (x)?</li>
                <li>By allowing the user to do (x) are we creating future problems?</li>
                <li>Does (x) align with our wider product strategy?</li>
                <li>How should we test our design of (x) with users?</li>
                <li>Do we already have anything in the roadmap that will solve (x)?</li>
                <li>Will we need to re-work our solution to (x) in the short/medium term?</li>
                <li>Do we have competitors that allow users to do (x)? If so, how do they do it?</li>
                <li>and so on…</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are some of the questions I ask myself when adding elements to an existing interface. When designing an entirely new user interface there are many more considerations I take into account. Maybe for another blog post :)</p>

            <p>So what are the takeaways? If you want to kill your product, make lots of design decisions really quickly. And do that for a sustained period of time.</p>

            <p>If you want a well designed product that is both a joy to use and to work on, go slow to go fast. Good design is like slow cooked food, the process is long but the outcome is always worth it. </p>

<![CDATA[Keeping NetBSD up-to-date with pkg_comp 2.0]]>

July 21, 2020 | https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/pkg_comp-2.0-tutorial-netbsd.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/pkg_comp-2.0-tutorial-netbsd.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>This is a tutorial to guide you through the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2017/02/introducing-pkg_comp-2.0.html">shiny new pkg_comp 2.0</a> on NetBSD.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong> to use pkg_comp 2.0 to build a binary repository of all the packages you are interested in; to keep the repository fresh on a daily basis; and to use that repository with pkgin to maintain your NetBSD system up-to-date and secure.</p>

<p>This tutorial is specifically targeted at NetBSD but should work on other platforms with some small changes.  Expect, at the very least, a macOS-specific tutorial as soon as I create a pkg_comp standalone installer for that platform.</p>



<p>First install the <code>sysutils/sysbuild-user</code> package and trigger a full build of NetBSD so that you get usable release sets for pkg_comp.  See <code>sysbuild(1)</code> and <code>pkg_info sysbuild-user</code> for details on how to do so.  Alternatively, <a href="https://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/">download release sets from the FTP site</a> and later tell pkg_comp where they are.</p>

<p>Then install the <code>pkgtools/pkg_comp-cron</code> package.  The rest of this tutorial assumes you have done so.</p>



<p>To use pkg_comp for periodic builds, you’ll need to do some minimal edits to the default configuration files.  The files can be found directly under <code>/var/pkg_comp/</code>, which is <code>pkg_comp-cron</code>’s “home”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf</code>: This is pkg_comp’s own configuration file and the defaults installed by <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> should be good to go.</p>

<p>The contents here are divided in three major sections: declaration on how to download pkgsrc, definition of the file system layout on the host machine, and definition of the file system layout for the built packages.</p>

<p>You may want to customize the target system paths, such as <code>LOCALBASE</code> or <code>SYSCONFDIR</code>, but you should not have to customize the host system paths.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/sandbox.conf</code>: This is the configuration file for sandboxctl.  The default settings installed by <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> <em>should</em> suffice if you used the <code>sysutils/sysbuild-user</code> package as recommended; otherwise tweak the <code>NETBSD_NATIVE_RELEASEDIR</code> and <code>NETBSD_SETS_RELEASEDIR</code> variables to point to where the downloaded release sets are.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/extra.mk.conf</code>: This is pkgsrc’s own configuration file.  In here, you should configure things like the licenses that are acceptable to you and the package-specific options you’d like to set.  You should <em>not</em> configure the layout of the installed files (e.g. <code>LOCALBASE</code>) because that’s handled internally by pkg_comp as specified in <code>pkg_comp.conf</code>.</p></li>

<li><p><code>/var/pkg_comp/list.txt</code>: This determines the set of packages you want to build in your periodic cron job.  The builds will fail unless you list at least one package.</p>

<p>WARNING: Make sure to include <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> and <code>pkgin</code> in this list so that your binary kit includes these essential package management tools.  Otherwise you’ll have to deal with some minor annoyances after rebootstrapping your system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, review root’s <code>crontab</code> to ensure the job specification for pkg_comp is sane.  On slow machines, or if you are building many packages, you will probably want to decrease the build frequency from <code>@daily</code> to <code>@weekly</code>.</p>



<p>Here is what the configuration looks like on my NetBSD development machine as dumped by the <code>config</code> subcommand.  Use this output to get an idea of what to expect.  I’ll be using the values shown here in the rest of the tutorial:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf config
AUTO_PACKAGES = autoconf automake bash colordiff dash emacs-nox11 git-base git-docs gmake gnuls lua52 mozilla-rootcerts pdksh pkg_comp-cron pkg_developer pkgin sqlite3 sudo sysbuild sysbuild-user sysupgrade tmux vim zsh
CVS_ROOT = :ext:anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot
CVS_TAG is undefined
DISTDIR = /var/pkg_comp/distfiles
EXTRA_MKCONF = /var/pkg_comp/extra.mk.conf
FETCH_VCS = cvs
GIT_BRANCH = trunk
GIT_URL = https://github.com/jsonn/pkgsrc.git
LOCALBASE = /usr/pkg
NJOBS = 2
PACKAGES = /var/pkg_comp/packages
PBULK_PACKAGES = /var/pkg_comp/pbulk-packages
PKG_DBDIR = /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb
PKGSRCDIR = /var/pkg_comp/pkgsrc
SANDBOX_CONFFILE = /var/pkg_comp/sandbox.conf
SYSCONFDIR = /etc
UPDATE_SOURCES = true
VARBASE = /var

NETBSD_NATIVE_RELEASEDIR = /home/sysbuild/release/amd64
NETBSD_RELEASE_RELEASEDIR = /home/sysbuild/release/amd64
NETBSD_RELEASE_SETS is undefined
SANDBOX_ROOT = /var/pkg_comp/sandbox
SANDBOX_TYPE = netbsd-release
</code></pre>



<p>Now that you are fully installed and configured, you’ll build some stuff by hand to ensure the setup works before the cron job comes in.</p>

<p>The simplest usage form, which involves full automation, is something like this:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf auto
</code></pre>

<p>This trivially-looking command will:</p>

<ol>
<li>checkout or update your copy of pkgsrc;</li>
<li>create the sandbox;</li>
<li>bootstrap pkgsrc and pbulk;</li>
<li>use pbulk to build the given packages; and</li>
<li>destroy the sandbox.</li>
</ol>

<p>After a successful invocation, you’ll be left with a collection of packages in the directory you set in <code>PACKAGES</code>, which in the default <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> installation is <code>/var/pkg_comp/packages/</code>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to restrict the set of packages to build during a manually-triggered build, provide those as arguments to <code>auto</code>.  This will override the contents of <code>AUTO_PACKAGES</code> (which was derived from your <code>list.txt</code> file).</p>

<p>But what if you wanted to invoke all stages separately, bypassing <code>auto</code>?  The command above would be equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code># pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf fetch
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf sandbox-create
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf bootstrap
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf build &lt;package names here&gt;
# pkg_comp -c /var/pkg_comp/pkg_comp.conf sandbox-destroy
</code></pre>

<p>Go ahead and play with these.  You can also use the <code>sandbox-shell</code> command to interactively enter the sandbox.  See <code>pkg_comp(8)</code> for more details.</p>

<p>Lastly note that the root user will receive email messages if the periodic pkg_comp cron job fails, but only if it fails.  That said, you can find the full logs for all builds, successful or not, under <code>/var/pkg_comp/log/</code>.</p>



<p>Now that you have built your first set of packages, you will want to install them.  On NetBSD, the default <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> configuration produces a set of packages for <code>/usr/pkg</code> so you have to wipe your existing packages first to avoid build mismatches.</p>

<p>WARNING: Yes, you really have to wipe your packages.  pkg_comp currently does not recognize the package tools that ship with the NetBSD base system (i.e. it bootstraps pkgsrc unconditionally, including <code>bmake</code>), which means that the newly-built packages won’t be compatible with the ones you already have.  Avoid any trouble by starting afresh.</p>

<p>To clean your system, do something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ... ensure your login shell lives in /bin! ...
# pkg_delete -r -R "*"
# mv /usr/pkg/etc /root/etc.old  # Backup any modified files.
# rm -rf /usr/pkg /var/db/pkg*
</code></pre>

<p>Now, rebootstrap pkgsrc and reinstall any packages you previously had:</p>

<pre><code># cd /
# tar xzvpf /var/pkg_comp/packages/bootstrap.tgz
# echo "pkg_admin=/usr/pkg/sbin/pkg_admin" &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgpath.conf
# echo "pkg_info=/usr/pkg/sbin/pkg_info" &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgpath.conf
# export PATH=/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin:${PATH}
# export PKG_PATH=file:///var/pkg_comp/packages/All
# pkg_add pkgin pkg_comp-cron &lt;other package names&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, reconfigure any packages where you had have previously made custom edits.  Use the backup in <code>/root/etc.old</code> to properly update the corresponding files in <code>/etc</code>.  I doubt you made a ton of edits so this should be easy.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Note that the last command in this example includes <code>pkgin</code> and <code>pkg_comp-cron</code>.  You should install these first to ensure you can continue with the next steps in this tutorial.</p>



<p>If you paid attention when you installed the <code>pkg_comp-cron</code> package, you should have noticed that this configured a cron job to run pkg_comp daily.  This means that your packages repository under <code>/var/pkg_comp/packages/</code> will always be up-to-date so you can use that to quickly upgrade your system with minimal downtime.</p>

<p>Assuming you are going to use <code>pkgtools/pkgin</code> (and why not?), configure your local repository:</p>

<pre><code># echo 'file:///var/pkg_comp/packages/All' &gt;&gt;/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
</code></pre>

<p>And, from now on, all it takes to upgrade your system is:</p>

<pre><code># pkgin update
# pkgin upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Enjoy!</p></article>

<h3>
What is Nintendo playing at?
</h3>
</div><div>
<div id="post-body-8506159587861018996">
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNtacp8-GoI" width="320" youtube-src-id="kNtacp8-GoI"></iframe></p><p>Nintendo's latest Direct hit yesterday to mixed reactions. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNtacp8-GoI" target="_blank">video</a>, at the time of writing, has 68,000 dislikes and 87,000 likes. Fans were disappointed at the lack of any major announcements given the drought in Nintendo Directs in recent months. The showcase highlighted <i>Shin Megamei Tensei 5</i>, <i>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster</i>, some DLC for <i>Cadence of Hyrule</i>, <i>Rogue Company</i> and&nbsp;<i>WWE2K Battlegrounds</i>. That was it. No <i>Doom Eternal</i>, no <i>Bravely Default II</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>While I expect Nintendo will undoubtedly release more smaller Nintendo Directs in due course, there is a much greater issue here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Everyone is talking about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</h3><p>Nintendo needs to step up to get gamers talking about the Switch again. Right now, the hot topics are the next generation of consoles coming later this year. <a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/will-july-23rd-mark-success-or-failure.html" target="_blank">Microsoft's event on the 23rd</a> is on everyone's lips, for example. If Phil Spencer and co show off a lot of gameplay for <i>Halo: Infinite</i> and other first party games, this could turn out to be an incredible event.&nbsp; Microsoft's Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart is supposedly going to be unveiled in August, adding even more impetus.&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if Sony released more information to combat the impact of Microsoft's event, perhaps even the price and launch date.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can Nintendo do to get the buzz going again?</h3><div><ul><li>Mario games in celebration of the 35th anniversary.</li><li>Announce <i>Breath of the Wild 2</i>.</li><li>Nintendo 64 games coming to the Switch.</li><li>New [insert old IP] here - imagine the reaction if a new <i>Wave Race</i> or <i>F-Zero </i>was announced?</li><li>Announce a Game Boy Classic.</li><li>Announce<i> GoldenEye 007</i> coming to the Switch.</li><li>Say "<a href="https://www.staticcatgames.com/2020/07/what-next-for-nintendo.html" target="_blank">Switch Pro</a> - coming 2021"</li></ul><p>What about Todd Howard showing a video of him playing <i>Fallout 3</i> (or 4) on the Switch? That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Yepp, more things I wish I'd known when I started, 6th edition.</p>
<p><em>You can find the first article in the series <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-to-program/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>And the previous article <a href="https://www.brainstobytes.com/advice-for-new-developers-or-things-i-wish-i-had-known-when-i-started-programming-part-5">here</a></em></p>
<h2 id="donttrytopredictthefuture">Don't try to predict the future</h2>
<p>We suck at predicting the future.</p>
<p>Every time you make an architectural/design decision, you close options in your design and constrain your program’s options for change. Designing is balancing the current needs (requirements) with possible future change requests.</p>
<p>Your main goal is to satisfy the current requirements and leaving as many open options as possible to accommodate future changes. If you get a hunch that in the future you will get a request for X feature and design to accommodate that, two things can happen:</p>
<p>1- The request comes, and hurray! you can easily sneak it in.</p>
<p>2- The request never came, and you end up with a subpar design that doesn’t relate to your current requirements, shame on you.</p>
<p>Because the second thing is more likely to happen, you avoid making the rookie mistake of designing for things you are not sure will come later.</p>
<p>Design is about balancing two things: satisfying current requirements and leaving open as many options as possible. You want to keep flexibility, and designing for hunches poses unnecessary constraints in your program.</p>
<p>So go for designs that are easy to extend and don't build towards a feature that might never come.</p>
<h2 id="communicatewiththeusersofyoursoftware">Communicate with the users of your software</h2>
<p>In a previous article in this series, we talked about our role as software developers. Our job, above writing code, is to provide value.</p>
<p>The most important prerequisites for being able to provide value is to know what our users need. Communication with end-users is important because as the creators of the software, we tend to have skewed ideas about the products we make.</p>
<p>There are many features and usability aspects that are obvious for us, but not for the users. Things that for us seem clear and intuitive can be difficult for people who... well, who didn't create the product. Communicating with users and understanding what they love and what they hate about our products is an important part of crafting the right solution.</p>
<p>It's true that we don't have those many chances to do this, but if there is a situation where you can talk to a user go for it. If it's not possible at all, become best buddies with your product owner and get regular feedback.</p>
<p>Remember that there are few things as sad as building a great product that solves the wrong problem.</p>
<h2 id="dontbeatechnomartyr">Don't be a technomartyr</h2>
<p>Career is important, but so is your private life.</p>
<p>I know this might not apply to you, but our profession is full of people who work a ton of extra hours. Neglecting family, friends and personal life in order to ship that extra feature is quite common among software developers.</p>
<p>I know you might need to stay in the office for a couple of extra hours on special occasions, it happens to everyone. But continuous neglect of other aspects of your life is impossible to sustain in the long term.</p>
<p>We are human beings, and the need to cultivate relationships and hobbies is an integral part of who we are. Having a network of healthy relationships around us not only makes us happier, but it also helps us produce better quality work. A happy and well-rested person with other interests tends to fare better in the long run.</p>
<p>It's not that extreme sacrifices will make you a star employee forever. Sooner or later you will burn out and your relationships will deteriorate, something that will ultimately impact your productivity if that's the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>So, spend time nourishing what matters. Your job will still be there later, and you will probably switch jobs several times in the following decades. Bet for sustainable growth and nourish all the aspects of your life.</p>

Stick to one or two product offerings at the beginning to test what works and the reception from the people.&nbsp;Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you can't have all your products as a subscription, if you are a company that sells more than 1 product or that plans to expand). Start with the one that will be the most suitable for the audience you try to convince. This could be your most popular product or a new product that you are trying to test in the market.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>Once you pick a product to sell as a subscription, you'll need a tool to manage your sales and operations since doing the process manually can get messy when you have a handful of customers. As you scale, you need to manage your subscribers; otherwise, it can become unmanageable.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Billing is one of the most complex aspects, especially if you offer different product variations such as <a href="https://fabfitfun.com/get-the-box/?step=getbox&amp;#plan=fffvip">Fat Fit Fun</a>, with the ability to choose what goes on the box or specific customer needs.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="4" role="list"><li>Give customers a try-before you buy option. Aren't your customers ready to subscribe? Ask them to buy for one month so they can try it and see if they like it.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="5" role="list"><li>Ensure customers have an option to suggest your product to friends. From the very beginning of your subscription business think of a strategy so customers can refer you to other people.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="6" role="list"><li>Another option is to send a special discount with the product if they refer more people or suggest your product to their friends. This is valuable if you are trying to scale fast.

<p>Many applications today still rely on traditional SQL databases like MySQL, MariaDb or PostgreSQL for data storage and data processing. With the growing amount of data and new workloads that are made with this database systems, we often find ourselves in situations where we need to think about scaling such systems.</p>



<p>When it comes to scaling, we might need to think about:</p>



<ul><li>data storage, if we store more and more data and it becomes expensive or slow working with them</li><li>fast INSERTs and UPDATES for write-heavy workloads</li><li>making SELECT queries faster because of their complexity or because they need to query huge amounts of data</li><li>concurrency if we have many clients interacting with the database</li></ul>



<p>In this article, I will present some basic ideas and starting points on scaling traditional SQL databases.</p>



<h3>Update the database</h3>



<p>Newer versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL and other traditional SQL databases typically come with performance improvements. Even if the newer database system is not faster as a direct replacement, there might be new features available that we can take advantage of. Keeping our database system up to date expands our options on what we can do with our data and gives us the best out of the box performance. It is a basic enabler for scaling.</p>



<h3>Scale vertically</h3>



<p>The most intuitive idea of scaling is to use better hardware to scale vertically (on one database server). When it comes to hardware we typically look at CPUs, disk and RAM:</p>



<ul><li>The number of CPUs affects how many queries the database can run and therefore how many clients can be served</li><li>The size of RAM gives us space for indexes, temporary tables and caches the database can store in a fast memory which makes our system faster due to minimizing IO access to disk</li><li>Disk IO speed highly affects the query times, especially for full scan reads (when indexes cannot be used) or for write-heavy systems</li><li>Disk size allows us to store more data</li></ul>



<h3>Leverage application cache</h3>



<p>If the application’s code is in our control we can cache data in a memory store like <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> to avoid querying the database. We don’t have to just cache database reads, but we can also use such systems as buffers for writes, e.g. when we are collecting analytical data and a possible delay is not a problem.</p>



<h3>Use efficient data types</h3>



<p>When it comes to data, it all starts with data types, in other words how individual pieces of information are physically stored in memory. Choosing appropriate data types is always a balance between efficiency and functionality, affecting the required memory, query performance and number of operations we can do with the specific data type.</p>



<p>There are two basic ways to think about optimal data types:</p>



<ul><li>logical: how to store general information like a telephone number or an IP address; for instance we can store color as a string, enum or as a collection of RGB integers and we can store IP address as a string or as bytes</li><li>physical: what specific data types we choose for strings, integers or time since we typically have multiple options; e.g. date and time can be typically stored as a timestamp (faster but with limited date range and functionality) or as a more complex datetime which is more developer friendly and flexible, allowing to store timezone etc.</li></ul>



<p>Using an appropriate type for a database column is especially important when we want to index the column, use it in the WHERE clause, use it for joins or when we have a lot of data.</p>



<h3>Data normalization and denormalization</h3>



<p>We are often trained to normalize data for relational databases in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. While this is generally useful, we might want to reconsider it for some of our data when it comes to scaling.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the simpler we make our data to be retrieved or saved, the more of it we can have.</p>



<h3>Precompute data</h3>



<p>A lot of SELECT queries can be optimized by having the data already in the requested form. This can be handy for analyzing large amounts of data. For instance, instead of aggregating data every time, we can aggregate them beforehand. Of course this isn’t always possible, e.g. we cannot aggregate other average aggregates because we would lose precision.</p>



<h3>Leverage materialized views</h3>



<p>Materialized views are continuously updated data that are updated on write operations or on scheduled time and can be seen as an extension of the previous point. Unlike classic views, materialized views are physically stored and don’t need to be computed when needed. This is useful for situations where a SELECT query would take a long time to produce the result.</p>



<p>As an example, look at <a href="https://www.pipelinedb.com/">PipelineDB</a> extension for PostgreSQL that produces aggregates on real-time data, allowing us to keep aggregated statistics on a write-heavy systems.</p>



<h3>Use proper indexes</h3>



<p>Using the right indexes on tables can be a huge performance changer. Typically, we should index the columns by which we want to query the data or which we want to use to perform joins. However, adding indexes can also reduce performance for write-heavy workloads, since indexes have to be updated on every INSERT and UPDATE. Also it doesn’t make sense to use indexes on some data types. So it is all about finding the right balance.</p>



<h3>Leverage the execution plan for query optimization</h3>



<p>For optimizing reads we need to know how the database query planner will execute our queries. We can use EXPLAIN statement to obtain the execution plan that the SQL server will use for our query.</p>



<p>Here we should look if the database plans to use any of the existing indexes on the tables or plans to make a full table scan. It can give us hints whether we should change the structure of our data, add indexes or rewrite the query in a different way. Please note however that full table scan can be also faster or necessary for some queries so it is not a black and white situation.</p>



<h3>Choose correct transaction isolation level</h3>



<p>The most common relational databases use multi-version concurrency control and make locking very granular (instead of locking the whole table, like MyISAM storage engine does). However, we still need to tell the database how exactly should the concurrency control behave and we can do so by setting appropriate transaction isolation level. There are 4 basic isolation levels in SQL:1992 standard and they will greatly affect how our database system behaves.</p>



<h3>Bulk INSERTs and UPDATEs</h3>



<p>Writing or updating individual rows in a table is not efficient, but databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL have ways to insert or modify data in bulk. We should leverage this every time we can.</p>



<h3>Compress data for storage</h3>



<p>Many times we don’t need to query the data by all the columns in a table. If this is the case, we can further optimize the storage size by storing some of the columns in a compressed form. This is especially useful for strings or some types of binary data.</p>



<p>Some databases or their extensions might be already compressing data under the hood so it always makes sense to look first how the data are stored and whether adding compression on the application layer would bring the desired benefit.</p>



<h3>Make ALTER TABLEs work</h3>



<p>When the amount of data or the workload grows we will experience slower and slower ALTER TABLEs to the point where some of them might not finish in a reasonable time. The first important thing to know is that there are typically two ways of changing the structure of the database tables. One is INPLACE, modifying the original table and the other one is COPY, creating a new table and moving the data afterwards. Databases typically try to modify tables INPLACE if possible, but it might make sense sometimes to explicitly ask for the COPY operation.</p>



<p>When adding a new column, it is better to add it at the end of the table, since inserting a column at a specific place is slow.</p>



<p>When changing existing column it might be a good idea to create a new column first, copy the data and remove the column afterwards.</p>



<p>If the write operations on the table make it difficult to perform ALTER TABLE, it makes sense to stop clients from writing into the table first. This is not always possible, but e.g. collection of analytical data can be postponed using an ingestion buffer in front of the database or we can temporarily pause our ETL jobs working with the table.</p>



<p>The last resort is to simply not do any ALTER TABLEs on large and write-heavy tables, opting for creating a new table to store the new data instead.</p>



<h3>Manage concurrent connections</h3>



<p>Every database server comes with some basic configuration on the maximum number of concurrent connections. When we need more, we typically need to reconfigure this value. Just increasing the value is not enough though – we need to make sure that our system can actually run well with our desired number of connections.</p>



<h3>Add read replicas</h3>



<p>Traditional SQL databases can’t typically scale horizontally for write operations by adding more servers, but we can still add other machines in the form of read-only replicas. The way this works is that all write operations are done on the main server and propagated to other machines using Write Ahead Log. All the replicas will therefore apply the same operations in the same order to the underlying storage as the main server. This ensures that the data will be in sync.</p>



<p>Replicas can be then used for scaling the number of read queries and number of connected clients if they only need read operations.</p>



<h3>Disk partitioning</h3>



<p>Partitioning allows us to distribute one single table across the filesystem and store individual partitions based on some specific rules. When such rules are chosen well, SQL queries don’t have to query all partitions but can limit their search only to a subset of them. This will cut the time the query will run since not the whole database table needs to be looked into.</p>



<h3>Use specialized extensions</h3>



<p>When we need to store and work with geospatial, time series and other …</p></div></div>

It is also a favourite of Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffets mate) - "...it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward", he pontificates.</p><p>In another interview, he recalls how, as an Air Force meteorologist during World War II, instead of asking what would keep pilots safe, he asked what would kill them and focussed all his efforts "on trying to predict snow, ice or fog—and to ignore pretty much everything else.".</p><p>I could write a book on all the other cool stuff Charlie Munger has said so I'll stop here.</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3><p>Inversion is based on the maxim - invert, always, invert. It is about considering an inverse (usually a negative) outcome and listing the reasons for these. It forces you to either stop doing certain things or avoid the actions that lead to the negative outcomes. It gives us <em><em>new possibilities</em> and capabilities</em> that we might not have considered otherwise.</p><p>The algorithm for inversion is very simple:</p><ul><li><strong>Define the problem</strong> - what is it that &nbsp;you're trying to achieve?</li><li><strong>Invert it </strong>- what would guarantee the failure to achieve this outcome?</li><li>Finally, <strong>consider solutions to avoid this failure</strong></li></ul><p>This is very abstract and vague, so let's look at a few examples:</p><ol><li>Instead of asking how do we increase the adoption of a product or feature? You could instead consider - what are some of things preventing adoption? This would lead to a list like this that you could potentially fix:</li></ol><ul><li>Slow load time i.e. performance issues</li><li>Not enough marketing, or marketing on the platform, or to the wrong audience</li><li>The user guide instructions are not clear ... you get the idea</li></ul><p>2. &nbsp;Following the inversion principle it is <em>better to ask</em> what is preventing me from reading all the unread books on my kindle/bookshelf, instead of asking how can i read more books? Possible reasons and something you could give up:</p><ul><li>I spend a lot of time on social media</li><li>I watch too many shows on Netflix or Disney +</li><li>Spend a lot of time on reddit or browsing hacker news</li></ul><p>3. Instead of wondering how do I always choose a winning stock during investing, ask yourself how do you prevent losses in the long term?</p><ul><li>Am I diversifying enough to prevent long term loss?</li><li>Am I investing &nbsp;based on sound principles, or am I speculating? </li></ul><p>Hopefully this &nbsp;gives you a flavour of how powerful inversion is as a mental model. I should add that it is NOT a silver bullet and it won't always give you concrete answers, but it will act as a forcing function to avoid obvious lapses in judgment. I'll leave you with another one of my favourite quotes about Inversion from Charlie.</p><blockquote>"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."</blockquote><hr><p>Further reading:</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://fs.blog/2014/06/avoiding-stupidity/">Avoiding Stupidity is Easier than Seeking Brilliance</a></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Feature stores are the new cool kids in the neighbourhood of Data engineering and AI (artificial intelligence). Hyperscale&nbsp; AI companies (such as Uber, Netflix) have <a href="http://www.featurestore.org/">built their own feature stores</a> to solve the problems of reusing, governing and securing access to features (data for AI) in a shared platform. Hopsworks is a modular open-source platform, developed by Logical Clocks, for managing data for AI (a standalone Feature Store), computing features (Spark, Python), and training models. In this post, we introduce the project-based multi-tenancy security model in Hopsworks for users, data, and programs. We describe how our project-based multi-tenant security model is, in effect, a form of dynamic role-based access control with zero performance overhead.</p><figure id="w-node-591b61e7aa1b-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f10585a943c7738c589d3c5_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.38.14.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.logicalclocks.com/blog/introducing-hopsworks-ai">Hopsworks.ai</a> is a SaaS version of Hopsworks, currently available on AWS. Hopsworks clusters can be run with an IAM profile, providing them with an identity in AWS with permission policies that capture what operations the Hopsworks cluster is authorized to perform in AWS - such as read/write data in S3 buckets. Hopsworks can also be used from Data Science and Feature Engineering platforms (Databricks, Sagemaker, KubeFlow, EMR) using API keys exported from Hopsworks.</p><p>This post is concerned primarily with the internal security model in Hopsworks that enables you to host sensitive data in a shared cluster, providing powerful access control and self-service capabilities. The benefit of Hopsworks project-based multi-tenancy model is that you can host many users and feature stores (and other projects) on a single cluster, with self-service access to different feature stores. The advantage of our security model is that you can host production, staging, and development feature stores in a single cluster - you do not need to manage and pay for separate clusters.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control#:~:text=Role%2Dbased%20access%20control%20(RBAC)%20is%20a%20policy%2D,simple%20to%20perform%20user%20assignments.">Role-based access control</a> (RBAC) is a well-known security model that enables administrators to give a group of users the same access rights to selected resources. With roles, an administrator at a company could define a single security policy and apply it to all members of a department. But individuals may be members of multiple departments, so a user might be given multiple roles. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85776-1_17">Dynamic role-based access control</a> means that, based on some other policy, you can change the set of roles a user can hold at a given time. For example, if a user has two different roles - one for accessing banking data and another one for accessing trading data, with dynamic RBAC, you could restrict the user to only allow her to hold one of those roles at a given time. The policy for deciding which role the user holds could, for example, depend on what VPN (virtual private network) the user is logged in to or what building the user is present in. In effect, dynamic roles would allow to hold only one of the roles at a time and sandbox her inside one of the domains - banking or trading. It would prevent her from cross-linking or copying data between the different trading and banking domains.</p><p>Hopsworks implements a dynamic role-based access control model through a project-based <strong>multi-tenant security model. </strong>Inspired by GDPR, in Hopsworks a <em>Project </em>is a sandboxed set of users, data, and programs (where data can be shared in a controlled manner between projects). Every Project has an <strong>owner</strong> with full read-write privileges and zero or more <strong>members</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>A project owner may invite other users to his/her project as either a <strong>Data Scientist </strong>(read-only privileges and run jobs privileges) or <strong>Data Owner</strong> (full privileges). Users can be members of (or own) multiple Projects, but inside each project, each member (user) has a unique identity - we call it a <em>project-user identity</em>.&nbsp; For example, user <em>Alice</em> in <em>Project A</em> is different from user <em>Alice </em>in <em>Project B - </em>(in fact, the system-wide (project-user) identities are <strong><em>ProjectA__Alice</em></strong> and <strong><em>ProjectB__Alice</em></strong>, respectively)<em>. </em>As such, each project-user identity is effectively a role with the project-level privileges to access data and run programs inside that project. If a user is a member of multiple projects, she has, in effect, multiple possible roles, but only one role can be active at a time when performing an action inside Hopsworks. When a user performs an action (for example, runs a program) it will be executed with the project-user identity. That is, the action will only have the privileges associated with that project. The figure below illustrates how Alice has a different identity for each of the two projects (A and B) that she is a member of. Each project contains its own separate private assets. Alice can use only one identity at a time which guarantees that she can’t access assets from both projects at the same time.<br></p><figure id="w-node-20ac5438fa1d-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1058b3943c77358489d4b1_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.39.44.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>An <strong>important </strong>aspect of Project based multi-tenancy is that assets can be shared between projects - sharing does not mean that data is duplicated. The current assets that can be shared between projects are: files/directories in HopsFS, Hive databases, feature stores, and Kafka topics. For example, in the figure below there are three users (User1, User2, and User3)&nbsp; and two projects (A and B). User1 is a member of project A, while User2 and User3 are members of project B. All three users (User1, User2, User3) can access the assets shared between project A and project B. As sharing does not mean copying, the access control rules for the asset are updated to give users in the other project read or write permissions on the shared asset.</p><figure id="w-node-7c5391a82675-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f1059150895622a73e57f16_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.40.47.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we will see later on, <em>project-user identity</em> is based on a X.509 certificate issued internally by Hopsworks. Access control policies, however, are implemented by the platform services:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>files/directories permissions for HopsFS, Hive (storage-based security policy), and the offline Feature Store;</li><li>Kafka ACLs using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>;</li><li>Elasticsearch Open Distro permissions using a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/elasticsearch-chef">Hopsworks project-based authorizer plugin</a>.</li></ul><h3>User Identity in Hopsworks</h3><p>When a user authenticates with Hopsworks, they are logged into the platform with a <em>Hopsworks user identity</em>. This user identity is needed to be able to construct the project-user identity - it is the “user” part of the project-user identity. In Hopsworks, a user-identity is mapped to a global Hopsworks role (independent of project membership) - a <strong>normal</strong> user or an <strong>administrator</strong>. A normal user can search for assets, update her profile, generate API keys, and change to/from projects. Administrators have access to user, project, storage, and application management pages, system monitoring and maintenance services. They can activate or block users, delete Projects, manage Project quotas, promote normal users to administrators, and so on. It’s important to mention here that a Hopsworks administrator <strong>cannot</strong> view the data&nbsp; inside a project - even if they are allowed to delete a project.<br></p><p>A user interacts with Hopsworks through the web application and they don’t necessarily realize that the web application is a facade to a modular distributed system. In the background we run <strong>HopsFS</strong> - our next-generation HDFS-on-S3 filesystem, <strong>HopsYARN</strong> - a cluster management system and scheduler, Apache Hive, Elasticsearch, (optionally Kafka and Airflow), and other logging and monitoring services.</p><p>A fundamental principle in every distributed system is that processes exchange messages over the network or through shared state (such as a filesystem or database). When communication is performed by message passing, it is imperative that we protect the messages from adversaries reading or modifying their content and validate the identity of the caller. Traditionally in Hadoop, they use Kerberos and GSSAPI to authenticate and authorize users and encrypt data in-transit. While Kerberos (Active Directory) is widely adopted by big organizations, the administration of users and services is a painful process and the system does not scale. On top of that Kerberos APIs are so complicated that <a href="https://apachebigdata2015.sched.com/event/3zv3/hadoop-and-kerberos-the-madness-beyond-the-gate-steve-loughran-hortonworks">programming against them can be really challenging</a>.</p><p>To avoid the pain of Kerberos (and be able to natively integrate with platforms like Kubernetes), we completely <a href="https://github.com/hopshadoop/hops">re-designed the security model for HopsFS and YARN to use certificates</a>. We replaced Kerberos with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with X.509 certificates to authenticate and authorize users. Certificates enabled us to also use the well established TLS protocol to provide confidentiality and data integrity. Every user and every service in a Hopsworks cluster has a private key and an X.509 certificate.</p><figure id="w-node-daa745592959-87a4da24"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f105955f5d5389cb463a175_Screenshot%202020-07-16%20at%2015.42.26.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>TLS-Based Multi-Tenant Services</h3><p>Hopsworks supports a number of stateful and compute services that use X.509 certificates to authenticate users, applications, and services: HopsFS, HiveServer2, Kafka, YARN. These services all provide their own authorization schemes. We unified HopsFS and Hive’s authorization models by providing 2-way TLS in HiveServer2 and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Storage+Based+Authorization+in+the+Metastore+Server">storage based authorization for the Hive metastore</a>, that we <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hive">ported to Hive 3.X</a>, to delegate access control decisions for Hive to HopsFS. In Hive, tables and databases store their data files inside directories on HopsFS, so HopsFS&nbsp; ACLs (access control lists) authorize file system operations by Hive (read from tables, write to tables). The easy-to-understand ACLs that we expose in Hopsworks (for Hive, and datasets in HopsFS) are captured in two roles: Data Scientists can read, Data Owners can read/write. HopsFS ACLs can be customized directly in Hopsworks from version 1.4.</p><p>For Kafka, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-kafka-authorizer">Hopsworks Authorizer plugin</a> that authorizes operations on Kafka topics by extracting the <em>project-user identity </em>from the client supplied X.509 certificate. The Hopsworks Kafka Authorizer then validates that the user is a member of the project that has permissions to perform the requested action on the Kafka topic.&nbsp;</p><p>HopsYARN uses X.509 certificates to identify users. HopsYARN also creates and manages (including renewal) application certificates for YARN applications (such as Spark jobs).

<tt>{philw,rob}@plan9.bell-labs.com</tt><h2>Abstract</h2>
Virtual machines are an important component of modern portable environments such as Inferno and Java because they provide an architecture-independent representation of executable code.  Their performance is critical to the success of such environments, but they are difficult to design well because they are subject to conflicting goals.  On the one hand, they offer a way to hide the differences between instruction architectures; on the other, they must be implemented efficiently on a variety of underlying machines.  A comparison of the engineering and evolution of the Inferno and Java virtual machines provides insight into the tradeoffs in their design and implementation.  We argue that the design of virtual machines should be rooted in the nature of modern processors, not language interpreters, with an eye towards on-the-fly compilation rather than interpretation or special-purpose silicon.<h2>Dis, the Inferno Virtual Machine</h2>
In early 1995, we set out to apply the ideas of the Plan 9 operating system [1] to a wider range of devices and networks.  The resulting system, Inferno [2], is a small operating system and execution environment that supports application portability across a wide variety of processors and operating systems.  Unaware of the contemporary work to establish Java [3] from the technology of the Oak project, we independently concluded that a virtual machine (VM) was a necessary component of such a system [4].  Because of improvements in processor speed and the feasibility of on-the-fly compilers, a VM can execute quickly enough to be economically viable.<p>
The Inferno virtual machine, called Dis, has several unusual aspects to its design: the instruction set, the module system, and the garbage collector.</p><p>
The Dis instruction set provides a close match to the architecture of existing processors.  Instructions are of the form</p><pre>	<i>OP    src1</i><tt>,</tt><i> src2</i><tt>,</tt><i> dst</i></pre><p>
The <i>src1</i> and <i>dst</i> operands specify general addresses or arbitrary-sized constants, while the <i>src2</i> operand is restricted to smaller constants and stack offsets to reduce code space.  Each operand specifies an address either in the stack frame of the executing procedure or in the global data of its module.</p><p>
The types of operands are set by the instructions.  Basic types are <tt>word</tt> (32-bit signed), <tt>big</tt> (64-bit signed), <tt>byte</tt> (8-bit unsigned), <tt>real</tt> (64-bit IEEE floating point), and pointer (implementation-dependent).  The instruction set follows the example of CISC processors, providing three-operand memory-to-memory operations for arithmetic, data motion, and so on.  It also has instructions to allocate memory, to load modules, and to create, synchronize, and communicate between processes.</p><p>
A module is the unit of dynamically loaded code and data.  Modules are loaded by a VM instruction that returns a pointer to a method table for the module.  That pointer is managed by the VM's garbage collector, so code and data for the module are garbage collected like any other memory.  Type safety is preserved by checking method types at module load time using an MD5 signature of the type.   </p><p>
Memory management is intimately tied to the instruction set of the VM.  Dis uses a hybrid garbage collection scheme: most garbage is collected by simple reference counting, while a real-time coloring collector gathers cyclic data.  Because reference counting is an exact rather than conservative form of garbage collection, the type of all data items must be known to the VM run-time system.  For this reason, the language-to-VM compiler generates a type descriptor for all compound types.  This descriptor reports the location of all pointers within the type, allowing the VM to track references as items are copied.</p><h2>Garbage collection</h2>
Memory dominates the cost of small systems, so the VM should be designed to keep memory usage as small as possible.  Through reference-counted garbage collection, Dis reclaims memory the moment it becomes unused.  Reference counting also eliminates the need for a large arena as required for efficient mark-and-sweep collection.  Both these results reduce the memory requirements of the VM and its applications.<p>
Compare this to the Java VM, whose instruction set makes it difficult to track references as objects are copied.  This biases against reference counting, so JVM implementations choose lazier techniques such as mark-and-sweep, inducing a larger arena and delayed collection, both of which increase the memory use and therefore the cost of the overall system.</p><h2>Issues in compiling</h2>
It is easy to interpret the individual instructions of a stack-based virtual machine (SM) such as the Java virtual machine (JVM), because most operands are implicit.  However, a high-level language implementation of the interpreter generates more memory traffic than the equivalent set of instructions in a memory transfer machine (MM) such as Dis.  Consider the code to execute<pre>	<tt>c = a + b;</tt></pre><p>
An SM would execute this by a code burst such as this, which we have annotated with its memory traffic using L for load and S for store:</p><pre>	<tt>push  a      # </tt>LS<tt>
	push  b      # </tt>LS<tt>
	add          # </tt>LLS<tt>
	store c      # </tt>LS</pre><p>
The corresponding MM code burst would be the plain three-operand instruction</p><pre>	<tt>add   a,b,c  # </tt>LLS</pre><p>
When interpreting, the extra memory traffic of the SM is masked by the time saved by not decoding any operand fields.   The operand fields are implicit in the SM instructions, while the MM they are explicit: three operand fields must be decoded in every instruction, even those without operands.</p><p>
When compiling, the tradeoffs are different.  Clearly, either design can produce the same native instructions from its just-in-time compiler (JIT), but in the SM case most of the work must be done in the JIT, whereas in the MM design the front end has done most of the work and the JIT can be substantially simpler and faster.</p><p>
A JIT for an SM is forced to do most of the work of register allocation in the JIT itself.  Because the types of stack cells change as the program executes, the JIT must track their types as it compiles.  In an MM, however, the architecture maps well to native instructions.  This produces a continuum of register allocation strategies from none, to simple mapping of known cells to registers, to flow-based register allocation.  Most of the work of any of these strategies can be done in the language-to-VM compiler.  It can generate code for an infinite-register machine, and the JIT can then allocate as many as are available in the native architecture.  Again, this distribution of work keeps the JIT simple.  </p><h2>Processors</h2>
The same issues that face the JIT writer also face the designer of special-purpose processors to support a VM.  Register allocation in the JIT is analogous to register relabeling in silicon, and an SM design adds unnecessary complexity to an already difficult problem.  One might argue that a stack-based processor design would mitigate the difficulties, but our experience with the implementation of a stack machine in the AT&amp;T Crisp microprocessor [5] leads us to believe that stack architectures are inherently slower than register-based machines.  Their design lengthens the critical path by replacing simple registers with a complex stack cache mechanism.<p>
In other words, it is a better idea to match the design of the VM to the processor than the other way around.</p><p>
Dis fits this criterion better, but we do not plan to implement Dis in silicon.  The idea of a VM is to be architecture-independent; offering a special processor to run it negates the original goal by favoring one instruction set.  Ignoring that for the moment, though, there could still be two reasons to consider designing silicon for Dis: performance and cost.</p><p>
On performance, history shows that language-specific CPUs are not competitive.  The investment in the special design takes energy away from the systems issues that ultimately dominate performance.   Performance gains realized through language-specific support tend to be offset by parallel improvements in general-purpose processors during the life cycle of the CPU.</p><p>
Dis compiles quickly into native code that runs only 30-50% slower than native C.  At the current rate of processor improvement, that is only a few months of processor design time.  It is wiser to focus on improving execution on commodity, general purpose processors than on inventing a new architecture.</p><p>
The issue of cost is more subtle.  Dis is close enough to familiar architectures that a special chip with high integration of systems facilities could be cost-effective on small platforms.  The real reason for that, though, is that the memory management design of the virtual machine makes it easy to implement Dis in small memory.  By contrast, whatever cost gains an integrated Java processor might realize will likely be lost in the extra memory required by its conservative garbage collection scheme [6].</p><h2>References</h2>

      <article role="main">
        <p>Welcome to the second post from my collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismattman">@chrismattman</a>.  We
were both intrigued when Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/">announced</a> a significant upgrade to their search algorithm in late 2019.  The technique
is super cool, inspired by the human brain, redefining how we search
for text, images, music, and more.</p>

<p>Here’s one example from Google’s post. Let’s say we’re wondering whether we can pick up medicine
for a friend, who may be sick and cannot enter a pharmacy due to Covid19
restrictions.  We Google it:</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image5.jpg"></p>

<p>Before this upgrade, Google would show us information about prescriptions on the
left.  Old Google would see high overlap between our keywords “get, pharmacy,
medicine” and the top blog post.  Statistically, these keywords are the meaty,
distinguishing topic of our inquiry.  The rest of the words are quite common,
such as “can, you,” and “for”.   Articles that only include those wouldn’t do us
much good.  Google would seek keyword overlap, finding the most authoritative
and relevant answer.  This is how search has worked for decades, which we call
syntactic search, based on the written syntax of human language.</p>

<p>The new Google thinks differently.  The new Google thinks like Bert with
tensors, as described in our previous blog post.  Here Google understands that
“can, for, someone” are key to our intent, even though the common words of “for”
and “someone” seem to carry little information by themselves.  These words,
along with the major keywords of “get, pharmacy, medicine” better define our
intent, encoded as a tensor.  Sure enough, today’s new Google finds a better
article on the right.  Note that the article talks of “prescription” when we
stated “medicine,” though these are clearly related, even though they don’t
match.  This new approach is called semantic search and it’s here and widely
available and easily implemented because of Bert.</p>

<p>Semantic search is cool.  It’s all the rage in the scientific community.  We
have high hopes that this tensor technique will allow us to better search
through our overfull inboxes, that pile of PDFs waiting to be read, or the
thousands of customer comments we’d like to process.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h3>

<p>Semantic search is a three-step process.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Encode content as tensors</li>
  <li>Encode a query as a tensor</li>
  <li>Find tensors that match</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="encoding-content">Encoding content</h3>

<p>We need a tool for turning content into tensors in <em>bulk</em>.  Currently this remains
the realm of research, though we suspect this capability will soon be
commercially available.   Please, are you listening, product people?   Bueller?
Has anyone seen Bueller?</p>

<p>We have two current favorites, one for scale, one for play.</p>

<h3 id="bert-as-a-service-for-scale">Bert as a Service, for scale.</h3>

<p>Han Xiao (<a href="https://twitter.com/hxiao0">@hxiao</a>) released an open source package in 2019 which takes the
latest, published version of Bert and encapsulates it in a web service.  Han was
recently a CTO at TenCent, now building a promising new company
(<a href="https://jina.ai/">Jina.ai</a>) for semantic search.</p>

<p>Han applied hardcore, distributed systems engineering and optimizations which
allows us to turn 256 sentence fragments into embeddings with a single call,
automatically and elegantly handled by a powerful cluster of energy-chomping,
GPU-enhanced, computational beasts.  We extended his code to run Bert on Google
Cloud in a public <a href="https://github.com/scottspace/bert-as-service">Github repository</a>; 
feel free to use it!</p>

<p>We use Bert as a Service in our applied AI work at Google and NASA, as it scales
nicely to handle millions of sentences.   If you’ve ever written a function in
Microsoft Excel, say, for taking the <code>@sum()</code> of a column, you now have what it
takes to use Bert!</p>

<p>Thanks to Bert as a Service, here’s how we turn three sentences about “apples”
into tensors:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>apple1 = bertify("Apple shares rose on the news.") 
apple2 = bertify("Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.") 
apple3 = bertify("Apple pie is delicious.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The values “apple1, apple2,” and “apple3” are 768-dimensional vectors
representing the BERT tensors.  We can execute these in parallel too, up to 256
at a time.  These are sent to a cloud service that can use your own, private
cluster of high-end, GPU-stuffed machines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>apples = bertify(["Apple shares rose on the news.",
                "Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.",
                 "Apple pie is delicious."])
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="spacy-for-play">Spacy, for play.</h3>

<p>Ines Montani (<a href="https://twitter.com/inesmontani">@_inesmontani</a>) and her co-founder started
<a href="https://twitter.com/explosion_ai">explosion.ai</a> in 2016 to
make tools for processing human language.  This kick-ass AI leader and her tiny
German company are having an outsized impact by focusing on simple, easy to use
tools that have immediate, practical value.  They contribute some of  their best
work to open source, as part of the “<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>” toolset.</p>

<p>Spacy provides tools for running Bert on your own, personal machine.  With 2-3
lines of code, you can be up and running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>!pip -q install -U spacy download spacy-transformers 
!pip -q install -U en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg

import spacy 
import en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg

nlp = en_trf_bertbaseuncased_lg.load() 
apple1 = nlp("Apple shares rose on the news.") 
apple2 = nlp("Apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter.") 
apple3 = nlp("Apple pie is delicious.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The values “apple1, apple2,” and “apple3” are objects where you can directly
access their BERT .tensor values.  We find this helpful in our personal and
exploratory research, where encoding a few thousand sentences is sufficient.
Again, it’s no more difficult than a one-line script in Excel!</p>

<p>We realize there are numerous other packages and research papers on how to use
Bert and its derivatives.  We like things simple and believe that’s the way
forward for mere mortals and also for your favorite blog authors trying to get
out a blog every few weeks.  If you’re not mentioned here, it’s because we find
it too hard to use or, frankly, are naively unaware.  Please keep pushing and
sharing!  The world needs your contributions to make AI simpler for all.</p>

<p>Our projects use these one-line interfaces to turn large quantities of raw text
into large quantities of tensors.  For now, we store these tensors and their
original text in cloud databases such as BigQuery or cloud storage such as GCS.
Absent those excellent databases, Pandas also works fine locally.</p>

<p>What we really want is a tensor store, optimized for storing, searching and
retrieving billions of high-dimensional tensors.  <a href="http://featurestore.org/">Feature stores</a> are a step in
the right direction, though they’re optimized for smaller vector sizes from
hand-built statistical features.  True tensor stores don’t yet exist.</p>

<h3 id="encoding-query">Encoding query</h3>

<p>The simplest approach encodes our query with a single call, as shown above.
This yields a single, 768-dimensional tensor to represent our search phrase.</p>

<p>In Spacy,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>query = nlp("Can you get medicine for someone pharmacy")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Bert as a Service,</p>

<div><div><pre><code>query = bertify("Can you get medicine for someone pharmacy")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sophisticated, production systems like Google extend our initial query with
similar words to account for mis-spellings, synonyms, and omissions. This
produces not one but a set of tensors to represent our search.  One shot becomes
buckshot.  Throw more at the wall and see what sticks. Yes, even AI uses
techniques from the era of cave dwellers and knuckle draggers.</p>

<h3 id="finding-tensors-that-match">Finding tensors that match</h3>

<p>Remember the neural science that inspired Bert?  We humans encode language in
the brain’s neocortex, a three-dimensional space.  MRI scans revealed that
similar language terms (such as “medical” and “pharmacy”) often land on the same
3D spots of the brain.  Thus, when we ask you for the first word that comes to
mind in a matching game, chances are you’re using the same part of your brain!</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image4.gif"></p>

<p>Tensors encode language in a space, too.  Computers aren’t limited to 3D; the
Bert algorithm reasons in a 768-D space.  Similar concepts are stored close
together, much like the neocortex.  We want our search engine to show us the
exact match, if it exists, followed by closely related text.</p>

<p>Here’s a plot taken from Bert answering a query, simplified to 3D.  Our query’s
the pale blue dot.  The closest tensors in the tensor universe are displayed in
colors, varying in intensity based on distance to our blue query.  This is how
Bert searches, as well as how NASA searches for exoplanets and extraterrestrial
life (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star/">true story</a>!).</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image8.png"></p>

<p>Computer scientists call this the nearest neighbor problem.</p>

<p>Given an input tensor T<sub>0</sub>, find the k nearest, neighboring tensors from a larger
set of tensors T.  T<sub>0</sub> is blue in the figure above, along with the 1000 closest
tensors (k=1000).  “Nearest” is defined as the shortest line you could draw –
in 768D – from one tensor to another.   There’s a bit of math involved to
calculate this distance, often taking a dozen instructions on a modern computer.
That normally wouldn’t be bad, except for scale and impatience.</p>

<p>The set T of tensors is often massive, on the order of billions of tensors for a
typical enterprise, trillions for the Internet.  Imagine encoding all social
media posts, or all documents in your enterprise, all email words and sentences.
Please stay away from Chris’s posts because that’s scale. We mean nearly 43K
posts of scale:</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image12.png"></p>

<p>Impatience is about the speed of business.  We’re accustomed to Google searches
returning in under a second, from billions of web pages.  We expect and want the
same from semantic search.  This is impatience.</p>

<p>Comparing the distance from our query to every tensor could take minutes on
modern distributed computers.  This ensures perfect recall but seemingly takes
forever in a world expecting instant results.</p>

<p><img alt="Dope" width="400" src="https://scott.ai/img/dope_image6.jpg"></p>

<p>You’re probably scowling right now, as Claude Shannon was in this cropped photo
from Wikipedia.  Claude was the father of modern <em>information theory</em> which became
the mathematical backbone to cracking cryptographic codes in World Wars, to
building the first computers, to deploying the first cell phones, and more
recently to developing the first vaccines for Covid19.</p>

<p>Claude formalized the idea of a “bit” of information, the smallest glimmer of
information we can understand from any source.   These bits were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>Clojure is one of the most interesting new languages targeting the JVM. Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.</p>

<p>Clojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations. The language “Lisp” is very lean and usually easily learned.</p>

<p>In this post, we’re going to create a complete REST application from scratch. There are already some (very) good tutorials available, but some are not quite up to date (see <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure-web-application">Heroku’s Devcenter</a> or Mark McGranaghan for good ones). Clojure itself is still a young language, Lisp of course has a lot of history.</p>

<p>Our application should allow creating, listing, fetching, updating, and deleting of documents.</p>

<p>A document looks like this (JSON encoded):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
      <span>"id"</span> : <span>"some id"</span>,
      <span>"title"</span> : <span>"some title"</span>
      <span>"text"</span> : <span>"some text"</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>A GET call to /documents should return a list of these documents.</li>
<li>A POST call to /documents with a documents as body shall create a new document, assigning a new id (ignoreing the posted one).</li>
<li>A GET to /documents/[ID] should return the document with the given id, or 404 if the document does not exist.</li>
<li>A PUT to /documents/[ID] should update the document with the given id and replace title and text with those from the document in the uploaded body.</li>
<li>A DELETE to /documents/[ID] should delete the document with the given id and return 204 (NO CONTENT) in any case.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="creating-the-project-scaffolding">Creating the project scaffolding</h2>

<p>We’re going to use <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, the defacto build system and dependency manager for Clojure projects. Download and install it, then execute:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">lein new compojure clojure-rest</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re creating a new <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki">Compojure</a> project called clojure-rest. Compojure is the library that maps URLs to functions in our program. Compojure (and our project) builds on Ring is the basic Server API. To start the new project run:</p>

<p>This starts the server on localhost:3000 and automatically restarts the server if any of the project files change. Thus, you can leave it running while we develop our application.</p>

<p>The <code>new</code> command generates two very important files for us:</p>

<p><code>project.clj</code> is the project configuration. It states dependencies, the entry point etc. (read the whole documentation on <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen.org</a>, and <code>src/clojure_rest/handler.clj</code> which contains a starting point for our application.</p>

<h2 id="project-configuration-project-clj">Project configuration (project.clj)</h2>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defproject </span>clojure-rest <span>"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"</span>
      <span>:description</span> <span>"FIXME: write description"</span>
      <span>:url</span> <span>"http://example.com/FIXME"</span>

      <span>:profiles</span>
      {<span>:dev</span> {<span>:dependencies</span> [[ring-mock <span>"0.1.3"</span>]]}})
Update the file to look like this<span>:</span>

(<span>defproject </span>clojure-rest <span>"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"</span>
      <span>:description</span> <span>"REST service for documents"</span>
      <span>:url</span> <span>"https://tutswiki.com"</span>
      <span>:dependencies</span> [[org.clojure/clojure <span>"1.4.0"</span>]
                     [compojure <span>"1.1.1"</span>]
                     [ring/ring-json <span>"0.1.2"</span>]
                     [c3p0/c3p0 <span>"0.9.1.2"</span>]
                     [org.clojure/java.jdbc <span>"0.2.3"</span>]
                     [com.h2database/h2 <span>"1.3.168"</span>]
                     [cheshire <span>"4.0.3"</span>]]
      <span>:plugins</span> [[lein-ring <span>"0.7.3"</span>]]
      <span>:ring</span> {<span>:handler</span> clojure-rest.handler/app}
      <span>:profiles</span>
      {<span>:dev</span> {<span>:dependencies</span> [[ring-mock <span>"0.1.3"</span>]]}})</code></pre></div>
<p>Besides the JSON parsing library <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire">Cheshire</a>, we added the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0/">C3P0 Connection Pool</a>, the <a href="https://h2database.com/">H2 Database</a> JDBC driver and Clojure’s <a href="https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc">java.jdbc</a> contrib-library.</p>

<p>I also updated the <code>:url</code> and <code>:description</code> fields.</p>

<h2 id="the-request-handler-handler-clj">The request handler (handler.clj)</h2>

<p>Next let’s have a look at the generated request handler <code>src/clojure_rest/handler.clj</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>clojure-rest.handler
      (<span>:use</span> compojure.core)
      (<span>:require</span> [compojure.handler <span>:as</span> handler]
                [compojure.route <span>:as</span> route]))

    (<span>defroutes</span> app-routes
      (<span>GET</span> <span>"/"</span> [] <span>"Hello World"</span>)
      (<span>route/not-found</span> <span>"Not Found"</span>))

    (<span>def </span>app
      (<span>handler/site</span> app-routes))</code></pre></div>
<p>The route <code>GET "/" [] "Hello World"</code> is responsible for our result we saw in the browser. It maps all GET requests to / without parameters to “Hello World”. The (<code>def app (handler/site app-routes)</code>) part configures our application (registering the routes).</p>

<p>Our first step is to update the configuration. We’re going to work with JSON, so let’s include some Ring middlewares to setup response headers (wrap-json-response) and parse request bodies (<code>wrap-json-body</code>) for us. A middleware is just a wrapper around a handler, thus it can pre- and post-process the whole request/response cycle.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>app
      (-&gt; (<span>handler/api</span> app-routes)
        (<span>middleware/wrap-json-body</span>)
        (<span>middleware/wrap-json-response</span>)))</code></pre></div>
<p>We switched also from the <code>handler/site</code> template to <code>handler/api</code> which is more appropriate for REST APIs (<a href="https://weavejester.github.com/compojure/compojure.handler.html">documentation</a>).</p>

<p>Next let’s define the routes for our application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defroutes</span> app-routes
      (<span>context</span> <span>"/documents"</span> [] (<span>defroutes</span> documents-routes
        (<span>GET</span>  <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>get-all-documents</span>))
        (<span>POST</span> <span>"/"</span> {body <span>:body</span>} (<span>create-new-document</span> body))
        (<span>context</span> <span>"/:id"</span> [id] (<span>defroutes</span> document-routes
          (<span>GET</span>    <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>get-document</span> id))
          (<span>PUT</span>    <span>"/"</span> {body <span>:body</span>} (<span>update-document</span> id body))
          (<span>DELETE</span> <span>"/"</span> [] (<span>delete-document</span> id))))))
      (<span>route/not-found</span> <span>"Not Found"</span>))</code></pre></div>
<p>We define GET and POST for the context “/documents, and GET, PUT, DELETE for the context “:id” on top of that. :id is a placeholder and can then be injected into our parameter vector. The POST and PUT request have a special parameter body for the parsed body (this parameter is provided by the wrap-json-body middleware. For more on routes, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Routes-In-Detail">Compojure’s documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Before we define the functions to carry out the requests, let’s fix the imports and open a pool of database connections to work with.</p>

<p>The namespace declaration is used to define which namespaces shall be made available by Clojure.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>clojure-rest.handler
      (<span>:import</span> com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource)
      (<span>:use</span> compojure.core)
      (<span>:use</span> cheshire.core)
      (<span>:use</span> ring.util.response)
      (<span>:require</span> [compojure.handler <span>:as</span> handler]
                [ring.middleware.json <span>:as</span> middleware]
                [clojure.java.jdbc <span>:as</span> sql]
                [compojure.route <span>:as</span> route]))</code></pre></div>
<p>We import C3P0’s <code>ComboPooledDataSource</code>, a plain Java class. Next, we fetch the functions defined in <code>compojure.core</code>, <code>cheshire.core</code>, and <code>ring.util.response</code> into our namespace, they can be used without qualifying. Finally we require some more libraries, this time with a qualifier to prevent name clashes or to support nicer separation. I’m not sure when to make the cut between <code>:use</code> and <code>:require</code> yet, so the cut is abitrary.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>db-config
      {<span>:classname</span> <span>"org.h2.Driver"</span>
       <span>:subprotocol</span> <span>"h2"</span>
       <span>:subname</span> <span>"mem:documents"</span>
       <span>:user</span> <span>""</span>
       <span>:password</span> <span>""</span>})</code></pre></div>
<p>Note, we use a in-memory database. If you’d like to keep your database between restarts, you could use <code>:subname "/tmp/documents"</code> for example.</p>

<p>Next we open a pool of connections. C3P0 has no Clojure wrapper, so we deal with Java classes and objects directly (hence a bit more code).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>pool
      [config]
      (<span>let </span>[cpds (doto (<span>ComboPooledDataSource.</span>)
                   (<span>.setDriverClass</span> (<span>:classname</span> config))
                   (<span>.setJdbcUrl</span> (str <span>"jdbc:"</span> (<span>:subprotocol</span> config) <span>":"</span> (<span>:subname</span> config)))
                   (<span>.setUser</span> (<span>:user</span> config))
                   (<span>.setPassword</span> (<span>:password</span> config))
                   (<span>.setMaxPoolSize</span> <span>6</span>)
                   (<span>.setMinPoolSize</span> <span>1</span>)
                   (<span>.setInitialPoolSize</span> <span>1</span>))]
        {<span>:datasource</span> cpds}))

    (<span>def </span>pooled-db (<span>delay</span> (<span>pool</span> db-config)))

    (<span>defn </span>db-connection [] <span>@</span>pooled-db)</code></pre></div>
<p>Since we deal with a in-memory database, we need to create our table now.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
      (<span>sql/create-table</span> <span>:documents</span> [<span>:id</span> <span>"varchar(256)"</span> <span>"primary key"</span>]
                                   [<span>:title</span> <span>"varchar(1024)"</span>]
                                   [<span>:text</span> <span>:varchar</span>]))</code></pre></div>
<p>The intent should be easy to understand, for the details take a look at the <a href="https://clojure.github.com/java.jdbc/">java.jdbc documentation</a>. We create a table documents with a :id, :title, and :text column. Note that the database column is called id, not :id.</p>

<p>The only thing missing are the functions to actually perform the actions requested by our clients.</p>

<p>To return a single document with a given id, we could come up with this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>get-document [id]
      (<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
        (<span>sql/with-query-results</span> results
          [<span>"select * from documents where id = ?"</span> id]
          (<span>cond</span>
            (<span>empty?</span> results) {<span>:status</span> <span>404</span>}
            <span>:else</span> (<span>response</span> (first results))))))</code></pre></div>
<p>It reads like this: when called with an id, open a database connection, perform <code>select * from documents where id = ?</code> with the given id as parameter. If the result is empty, return 404, otherwise return the first (and only) document as response.</p>

<p>The response call will convert the document into JSON, this functionality is provided by wrap-json-response, which also sets the correct Content-Type etc.</p>

<p>Another nice one is the creation of new documents:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>uuid [] (str (<span>java.util.UUID/randomUUID</span>)))

    (<span>defn </span>create-new-document [doc]
      (<span>let </span>[id (<span>uuid</span>)]
        (<span>sql/with-connection</span> (<span>db-connection</span>)
          (<span>let </span>[document (assoc doc <span>"id"</span> id)]
            (<span>sql/insert-record</span> <span>:documents</span> document)))
        (<span>get-document</span> id)))</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we use Java’s UUID generator (without import, hence the full package name) to generate a new id for each document created. The second let statement is responsible to replace the user-provided id (if any) with our generated one. Remember that Clojure’s datastructures are immutable, so we need to use the document variable thereafter, instead of the doc which still contains the old (or no) id.</p>

	<p><small>July 20, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Many languages start running your program by calling a function of
yours that must have a specific name. In C (and many C derived
languages), this is just called <code>main()</code>; in Go, it's <code>main.main()</code>
(the <code>main()</code> function in the <code>main</code> package). Python famously
doesn't require any such function, and won't automatically call a
function called <code>main()</code> even if you create it. Recently I read
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">Why doesnâ€™t Python have a main function?</a>
(<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function">via</a>),
which puts forward one discussion for why this is so. However, I have
a somewhat different way of explaining this situation.</p>

<p>The core reason that Python doesn't require a <code>main()</code> function is a
combination of its execution model (specifically for what happens when
you import something) and that under normal circumstances you start
Python programs by (implicitly) importing a single file of Python code.
So let's look at each of these parts.</p>

<p>In many languages things like functions, classes, and so on are
created (defined) by the interpreter or compiler as it parses the
source file. In Python, this is not quite the case; instead, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/FunctionDefinitionOrder"><code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> are executable statements</a>,
and they define classes and functions when they execute (among other
things, this is part of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/WhyMetaclassesWork">why metaclasses work</a>).
When Python imports something, it simply executes everything in the
file (or the import more generally). When what's executed is <code>def</code>
and <code>class</code> statements, you get functions and classes. When what's
executed is regular code, you get more complicated things happening,
including conditional imports or calling functions on the fly under
the right conditions. Or you can write an entire program that just
runs inline, as the file is imported.</p>

<p>(This has some interesting consequences, including <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ReloadRealBehavior">what reloading
a Python module really does</a>.)</p>

<p>However, Python is not quite as unique here as it might look. Many
languages have some facility to run arbitrary code early on as the
program is 'loading', before the program starts normal execution
(Go has <code>init()</code> functions, for example). Where Python is different
from these languages is that Python normally starts a program by
loading and executing a specific single file. Because Python is
only executing a single file, it's unambiguous what code is run in
what order and it's straightforward for the code in that file to
control what happens. In a sense, rather than picking an arbitrarily
named function for where execution (nominally) starts, Python is
able to sneakily pick an arbitrarily named file by having you provide
it.</p>

<p>(Compiled languages traditionally have a model where code from a bunch
of separate files is all sort of piled up together. In Python, you can't
really aggregate multiple files together into a shared namespace this
way; one way or another, you have to <code>import</code> them and everything starts
from some initial file.)</p>

<p>Where this nice model breaks down and needs a workaround is if you
run a package with '<code>python -m ...</code>', where Python doesn't really
have a single file that you're executing (or it'd have to make
<code>__init__.py</code> serve double duty). As covered in the official
documentation's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html"><code>__main__</code> â€” Top-level script environment</a> (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/fumh1r/why_doesn_t_python_have_main_function#c_jmer2v">via</a>),
Python adopts the arbitrary convention of loading a <code>__main__.py</code>
file from your package and declaring it more or less the point where
execution starts.</p>

<p>(Under at least some situations, your package's <code>__init__.py</code> may
also be executed.)</p>

<p>PS: contrary to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-doesnt-python-have-a-main-function-3afe6a8d093">the original article's views</a>,
<strong>I strongly suggest that you have a <code>main()</code> function</strong>, because
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/python/ImportableMain">there are significant benefits to keeping your program importable</a>.</p>

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
</p><p>
I'm specifically concerned with game development at the time of writing this
article. An idea for a turn-based tactics game came to me and I felt a Lisp
would be the best tool for realizing it, but the decision to use "a Lisp" still
leaves me with several choices. When I enumerate the notable design choices
behind each dialect, and talk about the approaches I prefer, my opinions will
be, in some capacity, framed as partial answers to the question of "will I be
able to comfortably use this to write a video game?" As such, there are a few
things I am specifically interested in:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Ergonomics</b>, or "a measure of the friction [one experiences] when trying to get
things done" [2].</li>
<li><b>Expressiveness</b>, or the ease with which code may be understood by a reader.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>, which is nontrivial to properly quantify [3]. I won't be rigorous
with this; a one-off run with <code>time</code> can give a good idea of the order of
magnitude for execution time.</li>
<li><b>Ease of distribution</b>, which is difficult to define, but with which I associate
platform agnosticism, a runtime that won't bloat my tarballs by several
gigabytes, and a lack of baroque and difficult to obtain dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Ability to interface with other libraries</b>, as I'll want to be able to
draw to the screen, and play sounds, and so on.</li>
</ul><p>
For each dialect, I'm allowing myself to use nonstandard functions. I'm aiming
for an evaluation of the practical aspects of each language, and if you were
writing software, you'd likely be using more than what's included in the R5RS or
ANSI CL standards. Though, if these nonstandard functions are specific to a
single implementation, I will avoid them. SRFI's and QuickLisp are fair game,
but CHICKEN's Eggs are not. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself. Yes, I will
be comparing Scheme and Common Lisp. I almost have to – the history of Lisp
tends to be spun as a schism between Common Lisp and Scheme. I will be speaking
of a few others as well. I've mostly chosen dialects for which there exists some
"game engine" type library. For R7RS (CHICKEN), there is <a href="http://alex-charlton.com/projects/Hypergiant/">Hypergiant</a>, for R6RS
(Guile) there is <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a>, for Common Lisp there is <a href="http://www.xelf.me/">Xelf</a>, and for Fennel there
is, of course, <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.

</figure><p>
What follows are my opinions, so I'd like to lead with the background that
motivated them. My earliest "serious" experience with Lisp was with Peter
Seibel's <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>, which I picked up in high school following a
failed attempt at reading <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The portion of the latter book that I did manage was enough to
convince me that learning <span>a</span> Lisp would be valuable, but that learning Common
Lisp may be more tractable than learning Scheme. The summer following my first
year of university, I taught myself Scheme to do <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>. Guile
quickly grew on me, and I soon began <a href="http://jakob.space/blog/transition-to-haunt.html">using Haunt</a> for my personal website. I've
been unknowingly using Emacs Lisp since much earlier – not in the sense of
writing packages – my old man taught me how to use Emacs when I was nine, but I
was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html">mostly shielded from having to write <code>setq</code> forms</a>. I've also used <a href="https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/">Hy</a>, <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>,
… well, I'm wildly off track now. Point being, I've used many Lisps, and I've
subconsciously acknowledged the differences between them, but never turned that
acknowledgment into coherent thought.
</p><p>
To aid in the comparison, I've written the same raytracer in several dialects of
Lisp. My reasons for choosing a raytracer are that:
</p><ul>
<li>I'm reasonably familiar with how they work.</li>
<li>Performance matters, and differences in performance is noticeable.</li>
<li>It's nontrivial, but several implementations of a raytracer is also more
tractable than, say, several implementations of a high-performance database.</li>
</ul><p>
Another consideration was the number of advancements in raytracing that build
upon the same basic structure, potentially giving me a way to compare the ease
with which a change to a system can be made, but writing these raytracers took
enough out of me that I didn't want to play with them any more.
</p><p>
This was not nearly as telling of a comparison as I had hoped. Once I'd
completed the first raytracer, everything that followed had the same structure.
Regardless, writing these raytracers gave me an idea of the characteristics I
was interested in, especially performance. For anyone who would like to look at
the code, the implementations are available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo">here</a>.

<p>
Well, if we're writing a raytracer, then, we had better have some way of seeing
the results. The issue is portability. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run the
raytacers on different implementations of each language, but none of them have
standardized support for drawing graphics. An idea I had was to render the image
to the terminal using ANSI escape sequences, but I thought the resulting images
would be quite shitty. Instead, I decided to go the <a href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0-getting-started">route that tinyrenderer
takes</a>, which is to output to an image file. Initially, the image format I went
with was the venerable PNG. This was a mistake. Even if it did lead to a rather
elegant CRC procedure in Scheme.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>chunk-crc</span> bytes)
  (<span>define</span> (<span>process-byte</span> crc byte)
    (bitwise-xor (vector-ref png-crc (bitwise-and #xff (bitwise-xor crc byte)))
                 (arithmetic-shift crc -8)))
  (reduce process-byte bytes #xffffffff))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Realizing PNG was needlessly complex, I went on to write a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo/tree/master/write-bmp.scm">BMP encoder</a>, which
was fine until I came across <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/">an article</a> from Chris Wellons about rendering video
with C by encoding frames as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/">Netpbm</a> images. I decided to scrap my BMP encoder
and go with PPM instead. Netpbm is text-based: the issue with a PNG or BMP
encoder in Scheme, for example, is that you're dealing with a binary format.
Glancing over the standards now, it seems there are, indeed, standardized
procedures for dealing with binary data in both R6RS and R7RS. Regardless,
dealing with those binary structures and having to consider endianness is a
pain. PPM is <span>dead</span> simple. In fact, I'd wager that if all you had access to were
the examples on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Wikipedia</a> page, you'd be able to write an encoder. Here's
the Scheme implementation:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>write-ppm</span> width height pixels)
  <span>"Encode the WIDTH by HEIGHT image given as PIXELS into the portable pixmap</span>
<span>format (PPM), writing the result to `(current-output-port)'."</span>
  (<span>define</span> (<span>delimit-values</span> values)
    (<span>cond</span> ((null? values)
           (newline))
          ((= 1 (length values))
           (display (car values))
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))
          (<span>else</span>
           (display (car values))
           (display <span>" "</span>)
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"P3"</span>))

  
  (delimit-values (list width height))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"255"</span>))

  
  (<span>for-each</span> delimit-values (vector-&gt;list pixels)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do away with my nice formatting, that's twelve lines of code, all of
which are R5RS-compatible. We have access to the Netpbm suite, too, so if we
want a PNG, we can always <code>./write-ppm | pnmtopng &gt; test.png</code>. Netpbm is a
real hidden gem. Well, hidden to me, at least.

If you aren't familiar with Scheme, it has somewhat of a self-imposed<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
reputation for appealing to academic types. It's also one of the most
opinionated languages I know of; all the specs of interest lead with an
assertion that "programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary." The way that Scheme embraces purity and
simplicity makes it clear it was designed by math nerds. (Hey, I'm a math nerd,
too. Take it easy.)
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned, there are specs. A few, to be sure. The evolution of
Scheme standards begins in a linear fashion: RRS → RRRS → R3RS → R4RS → R5RS. I
like to think of this as "classic Scheme". But when it came time to revise R5RS,
the ratification of the subsequent R6RS caused some controversy. It was
"bloated", or whatever. Something like that. So when it came time to design R7RS
(small), the Scheme Language Steering Committee decided to let the language
fork, beginning with the earlier R5RS as a blank slate [4]. That way, the nerds
that hated everything about R6RS could have their way, and the nerds that liked
R6RS could have their way. Scheme was divided, but at peace. Oh, and nowadays
there's a work-in-progress <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/src/default/R7RSHomePage.md">R7RS-large</a>. ಠ_ಠ

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Some abstractions are ticking time bombs, while others help you move fast. How can you tell? What follows is my personal exploration for how I assess abstractions.</p><h2>Problem</h2><p>We add abstractions in our programs to solve problems. So, let’s start with the fundamental value proposition: what problem does our abstraction solve? </p><p>Let’s take a look at one example abstraction:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(...) // =&gt; { intent: "set_alarm", at: "1593538633430" }</code></pre><p>This could be a natural language processing abstraction, which lets us take a piece of text, and extract meaning from it. The inherent problem of natural language processing is pretty darn complex, so an abstraction that helps us solve it would be very valuable. This is a sign of a good abstraction.</p><p>Now let’s compare that to </p><pre><code>StringSplitter.easySplit(str, splitStr)</code></pre><p>Maybe this abstraction, adds a light layer on top of string.split. For example, it may make it so you don’t have to worry about regexes, and can turn common string patterns into regexes. The value of a <code>StringSplitter</code> abstraction is pretty darn low. Maybe  <code>StringSplitter</code> treats <code>splitStr</code> in a way that’s a bit more in-line with the someone’s thinking, but at the end of the day this boils down to an indirection. </p><p>This leads us to the first principle. The more complex the problem it solves for you, the better the abstraction (1).</p><h2>Interface</h2><p>After we’re convinced that the abstraction we are about to add solves a tough problem for us, the next thing to consider is the interface: <em>how</em> do we interact with the abstraction? Imagine if <code>NLP.parse</code> was called like this:</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code></pre><p>This is a great interface. It’s small. We don’t need to understand any internals. For the main use-case, all we need to do is to provide language and text. Compare that with</p><pre><code>NLP.parse(
  text,
  lang, 
  strategy,
  shouldUseFlagA,
  ...
  shouldUseFlagZ
)</code></pre><p>In order to use this version, we’d need to deeply understand the internals of NLP.parse. This lowers the value of the abstraction, because we need to do more work to solve the same level of complexity. </p><p>This leads us to the second principle: <strong>great abstractions have small interfaces.</strong></p><h2>Breakthrough Cost</h2><p>Now that we have an abstraction with a simple interface that solves a hard problem, we need to ask a possibly fatal question: what happens when we need to break through the abstraction? </p><p>All abstractions are leaky at some point. What will happen when you need the abstraction to behave differently? What will happen when it doesn’t work as you expect? </p><p>For example, for <code>NLP.parse(lang, text)</code>, what if we needed to sort and score the results differently? What if there’s a bug, and we aren’t getting the entity we expect, can we look through and debug?</p><p>Understanding the answer to this, will give us the breakthrough cost. To do this, we need to peak through the code. How is <code>NLP.parse</code> implemented?</p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  return format(scoreEntities(fetchEntities(lang, text)))
}</code></pre><p>In one solution, it could be composed of other abstractions that we can take advantage of. This is a great sign, because we can reuse the underlying abstractions in cases where we need to do something more complicated. Compare that to </p><pre><code>parse(lang, text) { 
  internalParse(lang, text, flagA, flagB, ...flagZ)
}</code></pre><p>This feels more dangerous. If these flags all head to the same function, it’s a sign that a bunch of different features are complected together. It’s also worrying: what if one of these flags don’t do what you want? you may have to fork the abstraction.</p><p>This leads us to the third principle: <strong>great abstractions are transparent.</strong> I think this principle is the most overlooked. It’s easy to take the productivity win upfront, but if the abstraction you add can’t be changed, and can’t be introspected, it’s very likely to bite you at some point.</p><h2>Generality</h2><p>The final principle is orthogonal to the last three, but maybe it’s the most important. Hardy said <em>there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics —</em> So it is with abstractions. The beauty in math relates to how “general” and “tight” the solution is. I think this parallels well with abstractions. </p><p>If you use an abstraction that is “essentially” simpler, it’s more likely to last, and it’s likely to be more powerful.</p><p>Consider if the abstraction for <code>NLP</code>, was made up of specific algorithms, <em>just</em> for natural language processing. This would still be very valuable, but what would be <em>even more</em> valuable, is if the abstractions that this library was composed of was more general: if the parts that compose it were deep learning abstractions, you could reuse them for other problems.</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>And we reach the end. To pick great abstractions: pick the ones that solve a complex problem for you. Make sure they have a simple interface, and take a look at the internals, so you’re confident you can jig things up if needed. The more general and simple you can get for the same amount of power, the better. </p><p>Want to see some great abstractions in the wild? First, chances are you are using many of them: TCP, higher order functions like map &amp; filter, React. Some you may not have explored: Go’s CSP, Rich Hickey’s Datomic, or his <code>seq</code> abstraction in Clojure. As you pick up abstractions, I encourage you to run each one as an experiment: ask yourself at the end how things went, discuss them with your friends, and soon you’ll develop a much more nuanced taste.</p><p>(1) The rabbit hole gets deeper. Even if an abstraction solves a complex problem you have, you may need to take a step back and also ask: why do I have this problem? For example, kubernetes may be a great solution to building distributed systems, but why do you have a distributed systems problem? Many times the problem itself can be avoided. For the answer to that, <a href="https://stopa.io/post/241" target="_blank">Hacker’s Paradise</a> tries to covers it.</p><p><em>Thanks to Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Martin Raison, Sean Grove for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

</p>
<p>Disqus is one of the most popular commenting systems out there. However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">ZetaGlobal acquired Disqus in 2017</a> that changed the path of it. ZetaGlobal is a data-powered marketing technology company that “loves data”. So, they started using Disqus to collect data from millions of users around the world who visit websites that use Disqus as the commenting platform. Because of the “apparently free” pricing plan, Disqus had millions of websites using it, which made their data set the <a href="http://data.disqus.com/">largest on the web</a>. Disqus has lost a lot of users in recent times due to these privacy concerns, and there are plenty of reasons to remove Disqus. This blog post sums up 19 reasons why you should move away from Disqus.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Move Away From Disqus</h2>
<h3>1. Disqus places Ads on your Website</h3>
<p>If you are using the free plan of Disqus, they place ads on your website. This results in increased page load times, which will hurt your <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/on-page-seo-checklist/">on-page SEO</a>. It is also a bad experience for your users. Disqus seems to be crashing every party without any invitation. </p>
<h3>2. Disqus places Affiliate Links on your Website automatically</h3>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/disqus-potentially-adding-affiliate-links-users-content-opted/">Disqus was caught</a> placing affiliate links on the website without the consent of website owners. <a href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717122-how-to-disable-affiliate-linking">The official documentation says</a> that you cannot turn off affiliate links placed within the comments.</p>
<p>Let’s say one of your commenters mention “buy a camera on Amazon” (without links). Disqus will detect this and place a link from Amazon on this anchor text. When someone clicks this link and buys a product, Disqus will receive a commission. </p>
<blockquote><p>Disqus makes money <strong>from your content</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>3. Disqus is Owned by a Data/Marketing Company</h3>
<p>Most publishers think Disqus is a standalone company, which empowers social conversations on websites. Wrong! It is owned by a company called ZetaGlobal where your visitors become the product. &nbsp;Automattic founder&nbsp;<a href="https://replyable.com/2017/03/disqus-is-your-data-worth-trading-for-convenience/">Matt Mullenweg said in 2014</a>, “We’re tracking everyone who visits a website with Disqus enabled and building a profile on them based on the content of the sites they visit and any comments they leave. “Deeper” than Facebook.” This just says it all, doesn’t it?</p>
<h3>4. Disqus sells your Visitors’ Data without their Consent and has Violated GDPR</h3>
<p>Disqus collects user’s data from millions of their client websites. Worst, they sell them to big companies <strong>without the user’s consent</strong>. Their <a href="http://data.disqus.com/">data.disqus.com</a> website says their clients include companies like Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/martingund/status/1207327648093003777">This twitter thread</a> by Martin Gundersen reveals more information about their data selling. He calls Disqus a “Data Machine”.</p>
<h3>5. You are already Paying Disqus even when you Use the Free Plan (Spoiler: Your visitors are the products)</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the free plan isn’t free. You help the data company collect data. For example, assume that a.com and b.com have Disqus installed. You visit both websites on the same day. And, Disqus knows it! This is a crucial connection in the advertising field. When they sell it to another company, they will also know that you visited a.com and b.com. Advertising companies use this data to personalize the ads for you. So, there will be thousands of companies knowing what are your interests. </p>
<p>The same thing happens to your visitors. By using Disqus on your website, you are giving Disqus an opportunity to track them.</p>
<h3>6. You have to Pay to Remove Ads – But, there’s no Guarantee about User Tracking</h3>
<p>While you can subscribe to a paid plan of Disqus to remove advertisements on your website, there’s no mention if they stop tracking users. Disqus seems to track you and remember your computer, so to create another account and actually be able to comment, you have to find another computer. You’re being tracked in the name of advertising every step of the way on the Internet. In fact, Disqus is using the plugin to&nbsp;<strong>profile your visitors to later target them with ads</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Disqus makes your Website extremely Slow</h3>
<p>By injecting ads and third-party code to your website, Disqus will make your website extremely slow. Here’s a list of HTTP requests Disqus can add to your website:</p>
<figure><img src="https://fatfrogmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtmetrix-redirects-problems-from-disqus-ads.jpg" alt="gtmetrix redirects problems from disqus ads" data-src="https://fatfrogmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gtmetrix-redirects-problems-from-disqus-ads.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Source: fatfrogmedia.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The more HTTP requests you have the slower your website is. Disqus adds hundreds of spammy redirect links to your website. Additionally, it fetches a bunch of CSS and JS files to render the ads and affiliate links on your website. Even worst, these links come from third-party domains, which takes even more time to load due to <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/dns/">DNS resolving</a>. Additionally most people don’t have the time to create an account or switch between their Disqus profiles just to comment on a blog post. The year 2020 is all about hyper-distraction and inattentiveness. People ignore things that hinder progress. No one wants to spend five seconds logging into an account just to comment.</p>
<h3>8. Disqus discourages Commenters</h3>
<p>Disqus has millions of user accounts. However, it’s just a little fraction compared to 4 billion active internet users. Disqus doesn’t have a guest commenting option. While those who have Disqus accounts can comment easily from their account, what about others? Creating a new account just to post a comment isn’t reasonable. Guest commenting is a powerful option to have!</p>
<h3>9. Moderating in Disqus is complicated</h3>
<p>When you add a new website to Disqus, it creates a new subdomain for that website. You’ll need to switch between these subdomains every time if you moderate multiple websites. It makes moderation slower (And, it’s why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/d51ppa/slack_redirects_subdomain_to_appslackcom/">Slack moved from subdomains to app.slack.com</a> in their web version). </p>
<p>And, their admin panel isn’t a single page application, which makes it even slower.</p>
<h3>10. Disqus is Old-fashioned</h3>
<p>At the time of 2010, Disqus’s design was innovative. However, this is 2020. There are new and better practices and tools to make web applications more user friendly. Despite its resources, the company failed to make the product user-friendly. The usability factor is a good enough reason to remove Disqus.</p>
<h3>11. Disqus isn’t Customizable</h3>
<p>Disqus has a similar appearance in all websites. It would be impossible to see the discussion box due to the color scheme; on certain website templates, the discussion box would be almost invisible. A visitor would not be able leave a comment because the discussion box may appear to be missing. The fact is that it is not possible to apply custom CSS to the new Disqus. The plugin will automatically apply a scheme based on the text color it inherits from a website. So depending on whether your template’s stylesheet has a light or dark color scheme, Disqus will make a selection. It cannot be as customized as you love. </p>
<h3>12. Disqus’s Pricing isn’t Flexible</h3>
<p>Disqus has free, plus ($9/month), pro ($89/month), and business (Custom pricing) plans. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-people-buy-factors-influence-purchase-descision#sm.0001o2k17imgbe7411rqj2vln3h2q">80% of consumers</a>&nbsp;consider pricing as a major deciding factor when shopping online: This is not only applicable to e-commerce sites but even to those in the plugin market. If you’re looking for more control over how you pay for a commenting platform, then look for that one option, which offers you a great deal of flexibility and added features.</p>
<h3>13. Disqus only has Single Sign-on in their Custom Pricing Plans</h3>
<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/documentation/sso/introduction">Single sign-on (SSO)</a> is the most important feature for most companies. Disqus only provides it in their custom pricing plans, which is very expensive.</p>
<h3>14. Disqus Admins ban Websites without any Notifications</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/disqus.com">some reviews</a> saying their websites are banned by Disqus for no reason.</p>
<h3>15. Users are banned for Political Opinions</h3>
<p>Freedom of speech is important. There are many converstaions going on regarding Disqus banning users (not moderators of websites but disqus admins) for just having political opinions.</p>
<h3>16. Disqus Exports your Data into a Messy XML Format</h3>
<p>If you ever need to import Disqus comments to your own database, you’ll need more developer resources as Disqus imports the data into a messy XML format. </p>
<h3>17. Disqus adds “Do Not Sell My Data” Badge to your Website</h3>
<p>Do you like to have such irritating badge on your website?</p>
<figure><img src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" alt="Do not sell my data badge by Disqus" data-src="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Do not sell my data – Disqus</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s one more thing to consider: Those who don’t know this badge is placed by Disqus may think <strong>you (the publisher) are selling data</strong>. Want to destroy the trust between you and your visitors? If no is the answer, you’ll definitely need to remove Disqus from your site and move to a new privacy-focused solution.</p>
<h3>18. Disqus has a Heavy Spam Detector</h3>
<p>Disqus’s spam detector is known to be harsh. It’s worst when non-spam comments are detected as spam. Again, destroying the trust between your users and you!</p>
<h3>19. Disqus Support is Poor</h3>
<p>Disqus <a href="https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/poor_customer_support_from_disqus/best/">reportedly</a> has poor customer support. Moreover, it will be super hard to contact them if you have a problem to solve with your website. It will be impossible to do so if you are on their free plan.</p>

<p><a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/">Hyvor Talk</a>, a privacy-focused <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/disqus-alternatives/">Disqus alternative</a>, is created to solve all of those problems and help publishers to build thriving communities on their websites.

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

<p> 

In the last few years there has been quite a lot of activity in homebrew Retro-computing.  I really liked seeing things like the <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/">Craft Demo</a>, the <a href="http://belogic.com/uzebox/index.asp">UzeBox</a>, The <a href="https://gigatron.io/">Gigatron</a> and <a href="https://eater.net/">Ben Eater's</a> amazing work in making all of this stuff accessible to mere mortals.  There are a lot of toy projects out there generating video signals, sometimes composite, sometimes VGA occasionally something more exotic.   This has inspired me to address something that has bugged me for a long long time in the hope that people might want do do some 4 bit digital output to generate a 16 colour palette that isn't completely hideous.</p>

<h3>Here's the problem </h3><p>

This is the original CGA palette.  Known as RGBI, four digital lines for Red, Green, Blue, and Intensity.  it looks like this 
</p><center><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Dry Snot</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Blue </td>
    <td> Sad Magenta </td>
    <td> Sad Cyan </td>
    <td> Light Grey</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
    <td> Dark Grey </td>
    <td> Light Red </td>
    <td> Light Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Liht Blue </td>
    <td> Magenta</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>The Beauty that is RGBI.</caption>  
  </table>
  </center><p>
  
This arrangement of colours is somewhat unappealing.    To mitigate the worst of this a special case was introduced on the low intensity yellow colour where they halved the green brightness for that one colour.
This was a change to the monitors, not the video card, which strictly speaking had no concept of colour and merely output signals on 4 digital wires..
  

</p><center>
    <table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Brown</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr><td> Blue </td>
    <td> Sad Magenta </td>
    <td> Sad Cyan </td>
    <td> Light Grey</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
    <td> Dark Grey </td>
    <td> Light Red </td>
    <td> Light Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Liht Blue </td>
    <td> Magenta</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>  Much better, right, let's go to the pub.</caption>
  </table>
  </center><p>

 
This addition of brown helped a great deal, especially if you wanted wood <br></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eQbeZOWqd-s/XxTxn7TDS6I/AAAAAAAAAbU/h8kz0vqfepQLAlF26mCpgbgm7NJYKsO_wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Keen4.gif"><img data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" height="313" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eQbeZOWqd-s/XxTxn7TDS6I/AAAAAAAAAbU/h8kz0vqfepQLAlF26mCpgbgm7NJYKsO_wCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h313/Keen4.gif" width="500"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZWXYXHetGY/XxTxwh4gC1I/AAAAAAAAAbY/6zlO7dAxq5gpL-tb-gx-MMjELlsHBfzlwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Keen8.gif"><img data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" height="313" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IZWXYXHetGY/XxTxwh4gC1I/AAAAAAAAAbY/6zlO7dAxq5gpL-tb-gx-MMjELlsHBfzlwCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h313/Keen8.gif" width="500"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ge4w2gcgU8g/XxTx7LokUaI/AAAAAAAAAbg/Mk6P0X1Jk8kbrmZnmo4qSmg523zWLFRBQCLcBGAsYHQ/s740/the-colonels-bequest-1989_kf57.1080.jpg"><img data-original-height="555" data-original-width="740" height="375" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ge4w2gcgU8g/XxTx7LokUaI/AAAAAAAAAbg/Mk6P0X1Jk8kbrmZnmo4qSmg523zWLFRBQCLcBGAsYHQ/w500-h375/the-colonels-bequest-1989_kf57.1080.jpg" width="500"></a></p><p>


People managed to do quite a bit with that set but it wasn't an ideal arrangement.  When I look at homebrew video generators I can't help but think that there is a tendency to go with six or eight digital lines because four digital lines brings memory of this palette.    I wanted to know how much better you could make four digital lines without adding too much complexity.</p><h3>How did RGBI work anyway</h3><p>  
For starters lets look at an RGBI output mechanism.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rUu08JAtrqY/XxTv8IJswgI/AAAAAAAAAa0/QAuDa5Z6UoAYt9X05-qA4HCvd43R7jkXQCLcBGAsYHQ/s929/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi.png"><img data-original-height="522" data-original-width="929" height="351" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rUu08JAtrqY/XxTv8IJswgI/AAAAAAAAAa0/QAuDa5Z6UoAYt9X05-qA4HCvd43R7jkXQCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h351/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi.png" width="625"></a></p><p>

This circuit is designed to convert four digital 5V lines coming in at the bottom to three analog signals for Red, Green and Blue.  This particular one places the Analog signals into the 0.0V - 0.7V range of a 75 Ohm VGA input.   The intensity line on the right contributes to each of the red green and blue lines evenly to make all levels brighter.  The diodes on the right prevent the original Red, Green, and Blue signals from  crossing over into the other channels.   Those diodes are not strictly necessary though, we are aiming for a visual representation, not mathematical accuracy. </p><h3>Let's do the dumbed down version</h3>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nOaxU1nrSE/XxT0WWgkTsI/AAAAAAAAAcM/BYj31WTzBYkL0Z8SoLlnUXaWLkdyO9B-ACLcBGAsYHQ/s932/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi%2B-%2Bno%2Bdiodes.png"><img data-original-height="446" data-original-width="932" height="299" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8nOaxU1nrSE/XxT0WWgkTsI/AAAAAAAAAcM/BYj31WTzBYkL0Z8SoLlnUXaWLkdyO9B-ACLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h299/Marcel%2Bhackaday%2Brgbi%2B-%2Bno%2Bdiodes.png" width="625"></a></p><p>

This arrangement eliminates the diodes. This means that when the Red line is on a small amount of current can travel back through the intensity resistors and onto the Blue and Green lines.  Running the numbers shows it's not really a problem though because the voltage is already dropped fairly low and has to go through another two resistors to get out one of the other lanes.  When the any one the RGB lines provides 0.3V a sneaky 0.01V slips through to the other two.  When two of the RGB lines are high the remaining one receives an extra 0.02V which isn't noticeable.</p><h3>Now mix things up</h3><p>  
To come up with a better arrangement, the plan was to introduce some asymmetry in the resistors to see what colours would come out.  I still wanted all lines High to provide white and all lines Low to be Black.  The rule of thumb is that if I drop the resistance on one of the colour lines I should correspondingly increase the resistance on the intensity line that contributes to that colour.  </p><p>

In this sense you would represent the traditional RGBI as
</p>
<center>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th> Output line </th> <th>Color Resistor</th> <th> Intensity Resistor</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Red </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Green </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Blue </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
These are not merely boolean options, a range of medium values are available.  You have a restriction that no output combination should produce a voltage higher than 0.7V on any line.  Additionally if you want to have a white, you need to have a set of resisters that provide 0.7V on all three RGB lines when all of the input lines are high.  Initially i tried an arrangement something like this.</p><center>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th> Output line </th> <th>Color Resistor</th> <th> Intensity Resistor</th> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Red </td> <td> Low </td> <td> High </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Green </td> <td> Medium </td> <td> Medium </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> Blue </td> <td> High </td> <td> Low </td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<h3>A hint of lane crossing</h3><p>
I did some quick calculations on the colors and, while better,  I felt that the problem areas of the original RGBI system remained.  A good brown needs more Red than Green   So I tried shunting a little green over to red. After more tweaking and fiddling I decided to do the same with blue shunting to green and came up with 

</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AON7kUcR8tA/XxUAI7w6agI/AAAAAAAAAco/7AiKXLcmJs4ggCO2KNb05MmEVhbi1CMOgCLcBGAsYHQ/s960/Rgbi-alt.png"><img data-original-height="519" data-original-width="960" height="338" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AON7kUcR8tA/XxUAI7w6agI/AAAAAAAAAco/7AiKXLcmJs4ggCO2KNb05MmEVhbi1CMOgCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h338/Rgbi-alt.png" width="625"></a></p><div>

  <h3>What should that look like?</h3><p> 
In theory the voltages produced by this arrangement of resistors should produce a palette something like this.</p><center><table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td> Black </td>
    <td> Red </td>
    <td> Green </td>
    <td> Brown</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Dark Blue </td>
    <td> Purple </td>
    <td> Sea Green</td>
    <td> Pale Brown</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
   <td>Steel Blue</td>
    <td> Blush</td>
    <td> Leaf Green </td>
    <td> Yellow</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td> Denim Blue </td>
    <td> Mauve</td>
    <td> Cyan </td>
    <td> White</td>
  </tr>  
  </tbody><caption>A theoretically better palette.</caption>
  
  </table>
  </center>
<p>
To me, that looks like a better set of colors.  We now have two tones of brown. The yellow is less intense, and stab-your-eyes magenta has been mellowed to a mauve. Sad magenta has been shifted over slightly to be a purple.  Sad cyan is now greener for a nice sea green. The pure greys are gone and replaced with pale colours. I'm rather happy with it.  
</p></div>

<h3>What does it actually look like?</h3>
<div><p>
Of course this doesn't mean anything unless i can actually get it working.   I wrote a small Arduino program to throw out some VGA 640x480 timings and a simple test pattern and put the resistor arrangement on a piece of breadboard.  I'm not well equipped when it comes to actually making things. So my creation was a bit of a Frankenstein's monster of what resisters I had lying about wired in combinations to make values close to what I needed.</p><p>
 In the end I got the Arduino outputting a signal that resembled VGA enough for a monitor to display it. <br></p></div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iNIIxmM1ASk/XxUvURltVPI/AAAAAAAAAdE/QN4ufc1rsGIMiCjWU65dJU8CAZTEipp2gCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/IMG_20200720_173606.jpg"><img data-original-height="745" data-original-width="800" height="583" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iNIIxmM1ASk/XxUvURltVPI/AAAAAAAAAdE/QN4ufc1rsGIMiCjWU65dJU8CAZTEipp2gCLcBGAsYHQ/w625-h583/IMG_20200720_173606.jpg" width="625"></a></p>
  <div><p>
  I was actually pretty chuffed to get colours that close to what I had calculated.       The stripes on the side a a series of 1,2,3 and 4 clock cycle bands.   Because the monitor is expecting 640x480 the digital nature of the LCD is quantizing to make the thinner bars uneven.  I'm a little torn between the simplicity of getting picture out of a plain Arduino or going for a 25.175MHz clocked chip and seeing what I can get it to do.</p></div>
  <p>
    Today's objective is however complete. Giving a better set of 4 bit colours hopefully will be of use to someone and inspire them to make some cool things with hardware that was never meant for that purpose.   At two pixels per byte there is less data to move around so potentially allowing for new things.  I already have a few ideas.  A 74LS157 would fairly easily handle turning a byte into two pixels. leaving more time for fetching the pixels in exotic manners.  An Arduino would probably use a 74LS158 and a 74LS04 because of the creatively inverted outputs on PORTD. <br></p>

<p>Recent advances in machine learning are consistently enabled by
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-compute/">increasing amounts of
computation</a>. More
and more algorithms exploit parallelism and rely on distributed training
for processing an enormous amount of data. Both the need for more data
and more training impose great challenges on the software that manages
and utilizes the large scale computational resource.</p>
<p>Within Uber, we've developed algorithms like
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/">POET</a>,
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/go-explore/">Go-Explore</a>,
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/generative-teaching-networks/">GTN</a>,
etc., that leverage a large amount of computation. To enable future
generations of large-scale computation for algorithms like these, we
have developed a new system called <strong>Fiber</strong> that helps users scale what
might otherwise be only local computation to hundreds or even thousands
of machines with ease.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge-of-large-scale-distributed-computation">The challenge of large-scale distributed computation<a href="#the-challenge-of-large-scale-distributed-computation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In an ideal world, scaling an application that runs on one machine to an
application that runs on a cluster of machines should be as easy as
changing a command-line argument. However, that is not an easy task in
the real world.</p>
<p>While working with many people who run large scale distributed computing
jobs on a daily basis, we found that there are several reasons why it is
so hard to harness distributed computing nowadays:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>There is a huge gap between making code work locally on laptops or
    desktops and running code on a production cluster.</strong> You can make
    MPI work locally but it's a completely different process to run
    it on a computer cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No dynamic scaling is available.</strong> If you launch a job that
    requires a large amount of resources, then most likely you'll
    need to wait until everything is allocated before you can run your
    job. This waiting to scale up makes it less efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error handling is missing.</strong> While running, some jobs may fail.
    And you may be put into a very nasty situation where you have to
    recover part of the result or discard the whole run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High learning cost.</strong> Each system has different APIs and
    conventions for programming. To launch jobs with a new system, a
    user has to learn a set of completely new conventions before jobs
    can be launched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Fiber platform addresses each of these issues explicitly,
potentially opening up seamless large-scale distributed computing to a
much wider population of users.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-fiber">Introducing Fiber<a href="#introducing-fiber" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/uber/fiber">Fiber</a> is a Python-based
distributed computing library for modern computer clusters. Instead of
programming your desktop or laptop, now you can program the whole
computer cluster. Originally, it was developed to power large scale
parallel scientific computation projects like
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/poet-open-ended-deep-learning/">POET</a>
and it has been used to power similar projects within Uber. The key
features of Fiber include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to use.</strong> Fiber allows you to write programs that run on a
    computer cluster without the need to dive into the details of the
    computer cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy to learn.</strong> Fiber provides the same API as Python's standard
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a>
    library that people are familiar with. If you know how to use
    multiprocessing, you can program a computer cluster with Fiber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast performance.</strong> Fiber's communication backbone is built on
    top of <a href="https://nanomsg.org/">Nanomsg</a>, which is a
    high-performance asynchronous messaging library to allow fast and
    reliable communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No need for deployment.</strong> You run Fiber application the same way
    as running a normal application on a computer cluster and Fiber
    handles the rest for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliable computation.</strong> Fiber has built-in error handling when you
    are running a pool of workers. Users can focus on writing the
    actual application code instead of dealing with crashed workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Fiber can be used together with other specialized
frameworks in areas where performance is critical. Examples include
distributed SGD where many existing frameworks like
<a href="https://github.com/horovod/horovod">Horovod</a> or
<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html">torch.distributed</a>
have already provided very good solutions. Fiber can be used together
with such platforms by using Fiber's <a href="https://uber.github.io/fiber/experimental/ring/">Ring
feature</a>
to help to set up a distributed training job on computer clusters.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_overview" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_overview.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Fiber overview.</strong> The diagram shows how Fiber works on a
computer cluster. It starts many different job-backed-processes and runs
different Fiber components and user processes inside them. Fiber Master
is the main process that manages all the other processes. Some processes
like Ring Node maintain communications between each member.</p>
<p>Fiber can (1) help users who are working on large-scale distributed
computing to reduce the time to go from ideas to actually running
distributed jobs on computation clusters, (2) shield users from details
of configuration and resource allocation tasks, (3) enable faster debug
cycles, and (4) simplify the transition from local to cluster
development.</p>
<h3 id="architecture">Architecture<a href="#architecture" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber bridges the classical multiprocessing API with a flexible
selection of backends that can run on different cluster management
systems. To achieve this integration, Fiber is split into three
different layers: the <strong>API layer</strong>, <strong>backend layer</strong> and <strong>cluster
layer</strong>. The <strong>API layer</strong> provides basic building blocks for Fiber like
processes, queues, pools and managers. They have the same semantics as
in multiprocessing, but are extended to work in distributed
environments. The <strong>backend layer</strong> handles tasks like creating or
terminating jobs on different cluster managers. When a new backend is
added, all the other Fiber components (queues, pools, etc.) do not need
to be changed. Finally, the <strong>cluster layer</strong> consists of different
cluster managers. Although they are not a part of Fiber itself, they
help Fiber to manage resources and keep track of different jobs, thereby
reducing the number of items that Fiber needs to track. This overall
architecture is summarized in figure 2.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_architecture" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_architecture.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Fiber architecture.</strong></p>
<h3 id="job-backed-process">Job-Backed Process<a href="#job-backed-process" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber introduces a new concept called <em>job-backed processes</em> (also
called a <em>Fiber process</em>). It is similar to the <em>process</em> in Python's
multiprocessing library, but more flexible: while a process in
multiprocessing only runs on a local machine, a Fiber process can run
remotely on a different machine or locally on the same machine. When
starting a new Fiber process, Fiber creates a new job with the proper
Fiber backend on the current computer cluster.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_process" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_process.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Job-backed processes.</strong> Each job-backed process is a
containerized job running on the computer cluster. Each job-backed
process will also have its own allocation of CPU, GPU and other types of
resources. The code that runs inside the container is self-contained.</p>
<p>Fiber uses containers to encapsulate the running environment of current
processes, including all the required files, input data, other dependent
program packages, etc., to ensure everything is self-contained. All the
child processes are started with the same container image as the parent
process to guarantee a consistent running environment. Because each
process is a cluster job, its life cycle is the same as any job on the
cluster. To make it easy for users, Fiber is designed to directly
interact with computer cluster managers. Because of this, Fiber doesn't
need to be set up on multiple machines or bootstrapped by any other
mechanisms, unlike Spark or IPyParallel. It only needs to be installed
on a single machine as a normal Python pip package.</p>
<h3 id="components">Components<a href="#components" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fiber implements most multiprocessing APIs on top of Fiber processes
including pipes, queues, pools, and managers.</p>
<p><em>Queues and pipes</em> in Fiber behave the same as in multiprocessing. The
difference is that queues and pipes are now shared by multiple processes
running on different machines. Two processes can read from and write to
the same pipe. Furthermore, queues can be shared among many processes on
different machines and each process can send to or receive from the same
queue at the same time. Fiber's queue is implemented with Nanomsg, a
high-performance asynchronous message queue system.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_queue" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_queue.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4: Fiber Queue.</strong> This diagram shows a Fiber queue shared
across three different Fiber processes. One Fiber process is located on
the same machine as the queue and the other two processes are located on
another machine. One process is writing to the queue and the other two
are reading from the queue.</p>
<p><em>Pools</em> are also supported by Fiber. They allow the user to manage a
pool of worker processes. Fiber extends pools with <em>job-backed
processes</em> so that it can manage thousands of (remote) workers per pool.
Users can also create multiple pools at the same time.</p>
<p><img alt="fiber_pool" src="https://uber.github.io/fiber/img/fiber_pool.png"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: Fiber Pool.</strong> A pool with 3 workers is shown. Two of them
are located on one machine and the other is located on a different
machine. They collectively work on tasks that are submitted to the task
queue in the master process and send results to the result queue.</p>
<p><em>Managers and proxy objects</em> enable Fiber to support shared storage,
which is critical to distributed systems. Usually, this function is
handled by external storage like Cassandra, Redis, etc. on a computer
cluster. Fiber instead provides built-in in-memory storage for
applications to use. The interface is the same as multiprocessing's
Manager type.</p>
<p><em>Rings</em> are an extension to the multiprocessing API that can be helpful
in distributed computing settings. A ring in Fiber stands for a group of
processes who work collectively together as relative equals. Unlike
<code>Pool</code>, <code>Ring</code> does not have the concept of a master process and
worker processes. All the members inside the <code>Ring</code> share about the
same responsibility. Fiber's Ring models a topology that is very common
in machine learning when doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">distributed
SGD</a>.

<p>
    At this point, we are not as fond of Facebook as we used to be. We mostly
    are just not that active anymore, abandoned entirely, or even considering
    deleting our accounts. Something is holding us still, though; we have part
    of our history there. On each "status update", we registered a moment, those
    posts add up to document years of our lives.
</p>

<p>
    Even if you want to keep your Facebook account to save these memories,
    they are hidden from you by Facebook's newsfeed algorithm. Facebook
    decides which of your memories to surface, not you, and it is very
    cumbersome to search for them. If you want to move out of Facebook, but
    keep your Facebook history and gain the ability to search your old posts
    quickly, Quid Sentio can solve your problem.
</p>

<h3>Understanding Quid Sentio</h3>
<p>
	If you are not familiar with Quid Sentio yet, it is a digital personal
	journal that you can share with your real friends. Using text, audio, and
	custom tags, you create private entries, with an easy way to filter and
	search, and the ability to share and comment with trusted friends (real
	friends, not the ones that are your "facebook friends").
</p>
<p>
	Quid Sentio has an import tool for Facebook status updates posts. First, you
	have to export and download your data from your Facebook account, then
	upload that file to Quid Sentio, and all your status updates become
	searchable journal entries.
</p>

<h2>How to export your Facebook posts</h2>

<p>
	The first thing to do is to download a file from Facebook with all your posts. Here
	is a step-by-step tutorial on how to do it.
</p>

<p><em>Note: the screenshots presented here are from the new Facebook interface.
If your Facebook still has the old design, it might look different, but
the options are largely the same (or very similar). You should be able to follow
these steps without any issue.</em></p>

<h4>1. Go to your Facebook settings</h4>

<p>At the top right, click on the down arrow to open the menu. Select
<em>"Settings &amp; Privacy"</em> and then again <em>"Settings"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings &amp; Privacy option">
<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-menu-2.png" alt="Facebook menu, Settings option"></p><h4>2. Select "Your Facebook Information" and "Download Your Information"</h4>

<p><em>Note: Quid Sentio is prepared to identify the Facebook information structure
when it's written in English. If you use Facebook in another language, I suggest
you change it to English before exporting your posts (it is ok for the posts
themselves to be in another language).</em></p>

<p>
	In the Settings page, select the option
	<em>"Your Facebook Information"</em> on the left side menu.
</p>

<p>
	Then, among the presented options, click on
	<em>"Download Your Information"</em>.
</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-settings.png" alt="Facebook Settings page"></p><h4>3. Choose the format "JSON" and select "Posts" data to download</h4>

<p>You will see a box with download options. You must choose the format
<em>"JSON"</em>, so Quid Sentio can import your posts.</p>

<p>You can also decide which information you want to download. Quid Sentio will only
use <em>"Posts"</em>, but the information will be downloaded in separate files,
so you can choose as many as you want.</p>

<p>After selecting the <em>format: "JSON"</em> and <em>"Posts"</em>, click on the
button <em>"Create File"</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-download-select.png" alt="Facebook Information Download options"></p><h4>4. Wait until your file is available and download it</h4>

<p>You can't download your information immediately; Facebook has to process your
request. You will receive an email informing you that they are processing the
request and another email as soon as the request is processed and ready for
download.
</p>

<p>
    If you selected only the <em>"Posts"</em> type of information, it would
    usually take no more than 5 minutes. It might take longer if you selected more
    types of information.
</p>



<p>Once your file is ready, go back to the same page (<em>Settings &gt; Your
Facebook Information &gt; Download Your Information</em>). There, click on the tab
<em>"Available Copies"</em> and click on the <em>"Download"</em> button of the file
listed there.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/fb-file-ready.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>You will download a compressed ZIP file (ending in <code>.zip</code>) with
separate folders for each type of information that you selected to download. The
file with your posts is usually called <code>your_posts_1.json</code>. Extract this
file from the ZIP file.</p>

<p>Now you have your file with all your Facebook posts downloaded at your
computer. You are ready to import them to your Quid Sentio journal.</p>

<h4>5. Create your Quid Sentio account and upload your posts file</h4>

<p>Now the easy part. Go to <a href="https://www.quidsentio.com/" target="_blank">www.quidsentio.com</a> and Sign Up.</p>

<p>Then click on <em>"Account"</em> at the top right, and you will see the button
to <em>"Upload your posts .json file"</em>. Click on it and select the file you
just downloaded from Facebook with your posts (the one probably called
<code>your_posts_1.json</code>).</p>

<p>You will see how many status updates posts you have and show the button to
<em>"Start import process"</em>. Click on it and see the count of imported posts
going up. Please do not close the site or refresh the page until it finishes its
process.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-account.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download">

<img src="https://blog.quidsentio.com/img/qs-import.png" alt="Facebook Information file ready to
download"></p><p>That's it! You have now transformed all your Facebook status updates into
Quid Sentio journal entries. Experiment a little bit searching through your
older updates and explore your past in a way that Facebook never allowed!</p>

<h2><strong>Why</strong> transfer your posts from Facebook to Quid
Sentio?</h2>

<p>You know how to do it, but you might be wondering why do it. Here is a list
of a few advantages of having your Facebook update posts on Quid Sentio:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You can search and filter your posts.<br>
        Quid Sentio clearly shows all your old posts, with easy ways to filter
        by keywords, also allowing you to add custom tags for future reference.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will not be tracked or manipulated to addiction at Quid Sentio.<br>
        Quid Sentio is not supported by ads, so there is no need to track your
        every move nor use every trick in the book to keep you mindlessly
        scrolling. Quid Sentio does not use any third-party client-side tracking.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        You will have better control over your privacy.<br>
        Every entry (including the imported ones) is visible only to you by
        default. You can add real friends to your Quid Sentio network and
        individually decide for each entry who can read it. There
        is no way to search for people at Quid Sentio. You will have only
        the people you manually added as your friends.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>A few disclaimers</h3>

<p>In case you are new to Quid Sentio, there are a few things that are important
for you to know before deciding to import your Facebook posts.</p>

<p>You will only import your Facebook Status updates posts. The downloaded "Posts"
file includes lots of other types of posts that are not status updates. Things
like posts on your friends' timelines, posts on groups, on events. Those things
do not match the format of journal entries, so all of those are ignored. Just
your status updates are imported as Quid Sentio entries.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook pictures. While Quid Sentio entries allow for
images, it is a very different experience from Facebook with its
albums. You are better off downloading Facebook pictures and keeping at your
computer or another photo service of your choice.</p>

<p>You will not import your Facebook "friends". Quid Sentio meaning of "friends"
is very different from Facebook's. I believe you should add friends to your Quid
Sentio network very consciously, adding only those you really trust. I designed
Quid Sentio to avoid "contact spam" of any form. So I will not ask or even allow
you to upload your list of friends to Quid Sentio. You have to add them one by
one.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio is a paid service, not supported by ads, but by customers that
pay for it if they find it valuable. While you can create an account for free and
import all your Facebook status posts also for free, after that, you will have
become a Supporter ($19/year) to be able to create more entries.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, you can import your posts and leave them at Quid Sentio for
free. Only if you want to continue to create new entries that you need to become
a paying supporter.</p>

<p>Quid Sentio still does not have an export tool of its own. I do believe
everyone should have control of all the data they update to an online service.
The only reason Quid Sentio does not have this feature is that I am the sole
developer of Quid Sentio, so things are a bit slow to build. The export tool is
on the roadmap, so rest assured that by the time you sign up to Quid Sentio,
create a few entries, and decide to move out to another service and export your
data, it will  be ready.</p>

regularly, check our guide:</h4>

  <p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/plots/selected_run/UMAP_CA_Full_Annotated.png" alt="UMAP Embedding"></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/turing-basins">last post</a>, I shared my journey through understanding the link between entropy, thermodynamics, evolution, computation, and mathematics. At the end, I shared some preliminary research on using entropy/complexity to classify the behavior of Cellular Automata (CA) and perhaps pave a road to finding more universal CA (those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My8AsV7bA94" target="blank">capable of computation</a>). At that time, I only had a handful of samples which, albeit showing promise, fell short of demonstrating concrete results.</p>

<p>I am incredibly excited to share that I have now run my simulations on <em>every possible</em> Life-Like Cellular Automaton rule (a total of 262,144 rules), and it shows some great potential in classifying every rule based on its emergent behavior. Not only that, but this method establishes what appears to be a strong metric for finding “islands” of rules that have similar behavior.</p>

<p>This is exciting news, because past classifications of even elementary CA such as the semi-totalistic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood" target="blank">Moore neighborhood</a> variety (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton" target="blank">Life-Like</a> CA) have either required generalizations that are computationally intractable to ascertain, or required a great deal of manual filtering and edge-case handling in order to separate sets of rules into classes.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/expository/rule_30.png" alt="Rule 30"></p>

<p>Stephen Wolfram (one of the biggest researchers in CA) <a href="https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/02-2-2.pdf" target="blank">proposed</a> a four-level classification scheme for one dimensional cellular automata. He later extended these definitions to include two-dimensional cellular automata like the Life-Like CA we are looking at here. The classifications are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a homogeneous state.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a set of separated simple stable or periodic structures.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to a chaotic pattern.</em></li>
  <li><em>Evolution leads to complex localized structures, sometimes long-lived.</em></li>
</ol>

<p>But, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/ca/wolfram.html" target="blank">this post</a> regarding some caveats about these classifications, gliders have been found in all four of these classes. This is problematic because gliders are one of the most essential parts of data transmission in machines built inside of CA, so the four classes may not be enough to identify the presence or absence of a universal CA. Also, <a href="https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/02-2-2.pdf" target="blank">it has been shown</a> that, given a rule, finding which class a CA belongs to is an undecidable problem (for one-dimensional CA at least, but I would imagine the argument abstracts well to any Cartesian dimension).</p>

<p>My goal here was to focus on dynamic classification of the emergent properties of any given CA given its rules. By not subscribing to manually generated labels on classification, we can instead focus on developing a metric of similarity. In this sense, each rule becomes its own “class” and you can find rules that are sufficiently close in behavior to be considered the same class. Geometrically, this would be an analysis of CA by way of clustering.</p>

<p>The difficult part, of course, is developing a representation of a given rule that would allow for clustering. I settled on producing a curve of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" target="blank">Kolmogorov complexity</a> across the generations of the automaton’s universe. My inspiration for this approach came from a few core concepts. First, that entropy and complexity looked like valid metrics to measure the emergent behavior of a system and its potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality" target="blank">self-organized criticality</a>. My reasoning behind this intuition is that structure typically implies order, and order implies either repeating patterns or extension of structure that can be derived from existing structure. Kolmogorov complexity would capture the amount of bits required to express this structure. I later learned that this view is not a new one, as Wolfram took a similar approach in examining the procession of spacial and temporal entropy in <a href="https://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/cellular-automata-complexity/pdfs/universality-complexity-cellular-automata.pdf" target="blank">his research on one-dimensional CA</a>.</p>

<p>In a addition to the convenient dualistic simplicity of studying life-or-death CA, the grid of an automaton can be interpreted as a bitmap image. Image compression is (unsurprisingly) adept at finding something close to the smallest possible representation of an image, and PNG compression does it without loss of information. Image compression asymptotically <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/cluster.pdf" target="blank">approximates Kolmogorov Complexity</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266795088_A_Safe_Approximation_for_Kolmogorov_Complexity">up to a constant</a> dependent on the compression algorithm. Therefore, as the compression algorithm is the same for each measurement, we have a viable pipeline for estimating the Kolmogorov complexity of each state of the CA universes we encounter. If we wish to relate all of this back to entropy, we can do so. <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulv/papers/info.pdf" target="blank">Entropy is the expected value of Kolmogorov Complexity</a> in this context, so this data will be useful for that as well.</p>

<p>In order to get an amortized generalization of each rule, I started from random initial states of the universe with each cell having an equal probability of starting in any of the possible states. I then ran simulations for hundreds of generations with multiple random initial conditions and found the average complexity at each step. Other researchers looking into the general behavior of CA have taken this approach of random initial state and it seems to be a valid way to capture their behavior.</p>

<p>Lastly, I chose to study only Life-Like CA. These are the semi-totalistic CA rules that only depend on the Moore neighborhood of each cell. This made the search space something that I could simulate in reasonable time, given that it only had around a quarter million possible rules (even though it still took two weeks to generate all of the data).</p>

<p>The result of these simulations were 262,144 records of the average complexity in bytes of the board of all possible Life-Like CA. Each record had 256 samples, each record was averaged from 10 runs, and each rule was run with a board size of 100x100 cells.</p>

<p><img src="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/expository/webb.jpg" alt="James Webb Space Telescope"></p>

<p>Obviously, no one has the time to go through the graphs of over a quarter million samples, so I needed to find a way to classify the results. Recently I have been infatuated with the <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank">UMAP</a> algorithm. It has the ability to compress data with thousands of dimensions into a lower dimensional space (in this case 2D or 3D) while still preserving structures/features in the data. It is a remarkable feat of algebraic topology that deserves more awareness of in the scientific community.</p>

<p>When first learning about dimensionality reduction algorithms such as UMAP or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding" target="blank">tSNE</a>, I was extremely skeptical of their efficacy. It seemed impossible to retain structure when losing that many dimensions. What made their usage click for me was the knowledge that, even if your data lives in a space that has thousands of dimensions (called the ambient space), there is a very good chance that the <em>local dimension</em> of real-world data is of much lower dimension than this. The goal, then, of UMAP is to preserve the structure found in the data by finding a good manifold to embed it into. For further understanding on this topic, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU" target="blank">presentation</a> that Leland McInnes (the creator of UMAP) gave on his algorithm.</p>

<p>In a sense, UMAP is a digital telescope that lets us look at constellations of high-dimensional data that we have never had the ability to visualize before. Algorithms like tSNE have worked in similar ways in the past, but UMAP is the first algorithm to be efficient enough to run on data with thousands of dimensions using something as prosaic as a laptop and a dream. This is to say that UMAP scales incredibly well, especially when compared to what is already out there.</p>

<p>Armed with UMAP, I fed the algorithm all 262,144 vectors (each with 256 dimensions, one for each complexity snapshot) and patiently waited for the embedding to complete. After fifteen minutes of my laptop revving up my fans, I had my first snapshot of the overarching structure of the Life-Like CA (points are colored by the average forward difference between each complexity snapshot):</p>

<p><a href="https://kylehovey.github.io/blog/images/automata_nebula/plots/selected_run/UMAP_CA_Full_High_Res.png" download="">(High-Res Version)</a></p>

<p>There it was, the massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="blank">Hertzspring-Russel</a>esque serpent hiding in the structure of emergent complexity in automata. It is important to note that compressing dimensions can make parts of the data look separate in the embedding, even though they are connected in the ambient space they came from. It would be reasonable to assume that the serpent is one continuous entity, and the “jump” in the center was a result of the embedding.</p>

<p>While beautiful, this representation would not mean much if it did not accomplish the goal we set out to achieve: a metric for classification of rules that behave in similar ways to a given starting rule. Starting from the Game of Life, I began examining nearby rules and found that the metric did indeed yield other rules that produced uncanny behavior.</p>

<p>What is fascinating about this embedding is that it extends the idea of Stephen Wolfram’s four-level classification of CA to a continuum that can be embedded in as many dimensions as you see fit. CA classically known for supporting persistent structures and gliders such as Game of Life, Day and Night, and High Life exist in the middle of the serpent where the average difference is on the edge of chaos. CA that burn through complexity at a higher rate such as Morley, Anneal, and Diamoeba are far out on the tail of the serpent, along with many rules that result in universes that either die out quickly or fill the whole board with live cells (two low-complexity attractors). Meanwhile, rules like Replicator (which duplicates existing structure) exist in the head of the serpent where complexity stays roughly the same throughout the generations. Rules at the head seem to tend very quickly towards chaos, an apt opposite to the rules found in the tail.</p>

<p>
I needed an idea for the covers of the series of books that I'm writing,
<a href="https://aiprobook.com/"><i>Interactive Programming for Artificial Intelligence</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
My budget was (close to) zero, and I can't call myself an artist. Many ideas came
and went; none of them were distinctive enough. They weren't communicating the
message of the book series.
</p>

<p>
The main message of the book series? These aren't just
tutorials teaching some contemporary programming skills. I hope they are
much more than that!
</p>

<p>
This book series has an <i>interactive</i> approach. Every concept I'm writing
about is immediately illustrated with executable code. You can try it right away
in Clojure's amazing super-console: <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">the REPL</a>, which provides a genuine connection between
the programmer and the running program.
</p>

<p>
These are <i>programming</i> books. They go beyond theory, and they do not stop
at cute demos. The code you'll write is fast, flexible and extendable.
The real thing. Comprehensive, but approachable.
</p>

<p>
Not all of the books are strictly about <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>,
they are also about the programming foundations that are important
in building AI software.
</p>

<p>
These are several challenging areas on their own. Math: it's tough. AI: it's abstract.
Functional programming: it's funky. High performance computing on the GPU: get out of here!
Together? It's a tough sell!
</p>

<p>
Finally though, the answer fell into my lap. Meet Dog and Bird, they are two friends
that bravely immerse themselves into challenging activities and make them effortless and fun!
</p>

<p>
These books are great for beginners. It's not easy, but everything is simply explained.
You don't have to be an expert to start, but you will become one as you progress.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>There are a lot of books in the world. How do you choose which ones to read?</p><p>There are at least two questions here:</p><ul><li>What topics should I read about?</li><li>What books do I read within a topic?</li></ul><p>For some people, the answer to the topic question is easy. They're obsessed with a given topic. They move onto the second problem.</p><p>For others, like myself, the first can be daunting. It's not that there aren't enough topics, it's that there are too many. If I look at my Goodreads want to read list right now, I see books on the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138264.Mathematical_Models_of_Social_Evolution">Mathematical models of social evolution</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256965.Six_Myths_about_the_Good_Life">Philosophical views on the good life</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49930783-why-we-re-polarized">Political polarisation in the US</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178447.Leaders">Nixon's take on different state leaders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23582015-principles-of-neural-design">Neuroscience and neural design</a></li></ul><p>Each of these topics seem great and the books seemed good enough to justify saving. I have 176 more on my list. A friend just emailed me about<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Liberalism-Failed-Politics-Culture/dp/0300223447"> Why Liberalism Failed</a> and it turns out that book looks interesting as well. How to choose?</p><p>This post is about modeling my reading engine. It's about reading for insight, reading to uncover valuable and relevant information and skills. There are other reasons to read, like to relax or for social reasons. They can be related, but I'm largely going to ignore those reasons here. This may come across as utilitarian and boring, but that's the cost of being serious.</p><p>Let's step back and consider what kind of decision is at stake here. Decisions can vary on the following dimensions:</p><ul><li>reversibility</li><li>stakes</li><li>prior uncertainty</li><li>post certainty</li></ul><p>When decisions are irreversible, you'll want to ensure that you take the correct one. So you'll spend more time on the decision. If they are reversible and you learn you made the wrong decision, no problem, you can change. Choosing between job offers is the sort of thing you'll likely want to spend a decent amount of time on. The switching costs are usually high. If you want a better example, consider the decision of whether to have a kid or not.</p><p>If decisions are high stakes, deciding correctly matters more. Not so much if they're smaller potatoes. Spend more time on choosing a job, less time on what to watch this evening.</p><p>If decisions are made in a shroud of uncertainty, then the value of additional information will be higher. Prior uncertainty refers to the amount of uncertainty before a given decision. Often, "When it comes to perceiving reality, our minds are in a fog."</p><p>Post certainty refers to the amount and rate of relevant information flow after making a decision. That's a bit abstract, but we all know that after some decisions, you'll know right away whether you made the right one. Ordering at some restaurants is like this. After other decisions, such as longer term investments, you may never know. To be more precise, a decision will be higher in post certainty to the degree that, after you make the decision, you get relevant information and you get that information quickly.</p><p>With these in mind we can see that the decision to read on a particular topic is:</p><ul><li>reversible</li><li>medium stakes</li><li>variable prior uncertainty</li><li>reasonable post certainty</li></ul><p>The decision is reversible because you can stop reading at any point. Reading is somewhat important (it depends), but not as high stakes as many decisions we make. There can initially be a lot of prior uncertainty, ideally this goes down over a life. Occasionally, the result of a decision won't be evaluable for years, for example, when it's tied up with a risky research project. An example of this is deciding to become an expert in nanotech in the early 2000s. Yet if you know that you want to take a bet on high risk, world shaping technological developments then, by asking the right questions, you'll be able to reduce uncertainty. Given that you're studying nanotech, you can evaluate whether you're studying the right issues within that domain. You can do all of this even if the decision to study nanotech won't be evaluable for years.</p><p>So choosing what domains to hop into is reversible, medium stakes, has variable uncertainty, and has a reasonable amount of post certainty.</p><p>There are two key upshots here:</p><ul><li>First, what you read is determined by your projects. If you're uncertain about your projects, that uncertainty will trickle down. When I was studying philosophy, learning software engineering, or heads down in<a href="http://stoameditation.com/"> Stoa</a> I had less uncertainty about what to read. If I'm exploring different projects, there's more uncertainty.</li><li>The second, is that deciding what to read is a game you'll play over and over again. It's a reversible decision that you can get better at.</li></ul><p>What you want to think of doing then, is designing a reading engine. You're not making one-off judgements about what to read for all time. Instead, you're setting up a system for selecting, consuming, and then utilizing information. Books play a small role in that ecosystem - they're not even the primary unit.</p><h3 id="building-a-reading-engine">Building A Reading Engine</h3><p>This engine can be modeled as a pipeline:<br></p><figure><img src="https://www.calebontiveros.com/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-7.47.11-AM.png"><figcaption>Created with <em><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>'s </em>nascent <em>diagram tool.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Reading is the core activity. But it's interwoven with a number of other activities.</p><p>What I read is influenced by what I've collected into my reserves, projects, the questions I'm asking, and curiosity.</p><p><strong>Reserves</strong><br>The reserves is a list of books that I found intriguing at one point or another. It isn't a list of books to read. That seems too prescriptive - I won't read every book in my reserve. Instead, it's a list of books that I may read, if I get excited about the relevant topic. The books are on deck, as it were.</p><p>Some of my favorite ways to populate my reserves is through interviews, blog posts, conversations, and Twitter. I usually find the best pieces at the end of bibliographies or during a simple search.</p><p><strong>Projects</strong><br>The most influential driver of this pipeline is projects. I like to think of my life as organized around a few projects or goals. Some of these are mundane, others grand. Whatever they are, they should guide what you read. If you're looking for insight, that's in the purpose of something or other. Examples of projects are:</p><ul><li>Building better habits</li><li>Learning about formal methods in cultural evolution</li><li>Aiming to be more Stoic</li><li>Cooking more varied dishes</li><li>Running a reading group on power and influence in organizations</li></ul><p>As noted above, uncertainty about your projects trickles down. If it seems like there are too many things to read, that may be a sign that you have too many projects.</p><p>If this is you, you can let your work inform whether they should get dropped or not. If you want to cull projects more aggressively, <a href="https://www.calebontiveros.com/on-disproving-your-own-ideas/">derisk</a> and<a href="https://effectivealtruismcoaching.com/blog/2020/6/26/five-ways-to-prioritize-better"> prioritize</a>. Focus on questions like:</p><ul><li>What can I learn that would make this project not matter to me?</li><li>What cheap tests would show that this project won't work?</li><li>Can I build an MVP of this project?</li><li>What specific questions about this topic do I want answered? What would answers unlock?</li></ul><p><strong>Questions</strong><br>Projects are vague and not sufficient for narrowing down the solution set on their own. Instead, list questions that you want answers to. If reading is inquiry guided, you're more likely to find what you want and spend less time trawling through books that feel relevant, but aren't.</p><p>Questions can help you choose the right things to read. What you decide to spend your attention on is a reversible decision. You can stop reading at any moment. So, if, like me, you feel like there are too many topics, narrow it by answering questions like:</p><ul><li>What's the chance that this topic is related to my project?</li><li>If I understand this completely, how will that be helpful in advancing my project?</li><li>How long will it take you to understand this topic? Is it worth the cost?</li></ul><p>Think of reading as inquiry guided. Your questions are the fundamental units. Read in order to answer specific queries you have. Once you've answered a question, that should generate more questions and output. If you can't find the answer, put the book down.</p><p>As an example, I want to read the book on neural design, because I'm interested in the nature of emotion. Often I feel like I read neuroscientific explanations of behavior and they don't feel like explanations at all. On the surface, they appear to be very black box (x module is linked with this behavior). Plausibly, explaining how the brain works from an engineering perspective is more illuminating. So, if I read that book then I should come into with the questions:</p><ul><li>Does this book give a new kind of explanation?</li><li>Is this explanation useful to understanding the nature of emotion?</li></ul><p>I can likely figure this out pretty quickly. If the answer is no, I can stop reading. Returning to the framework above, reading has reasonably high post certainty. As you read, you can get a sense of whether you're reading the right thing by updating on the book’s quality and whether it has what you want in it.</p><div><p>As an aside answers to these questions are things that should end up in notes. And if the answers help me push the peanut forward, they'll influence other questions, an essay, or project.</p><p><strong>Output</strong><br>Your project likely has some private or public output.</p></div><p>For me the private output is in the form of anki cards and notes.<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"> Anki</a> is a fun and useful way to remember things. A lot of people are excited about note taking systems and software today. The most important part about notes is that they actually answer the questions that you have.</p><p>Public output can be anything from behavior change to essays, from conversations in person to email. Putting things out there will help you get feedback, speed up your projects, ask better questions, and provide value to others.<br></p><p><strong>Occurrent Curiosity</strong><br>Not all things should be so structured. Plausibly some amount of reading shouldn't fit that tightly into your system. You're more likely to discover something neglected if you read things for the sake of reading them on occasion.</p><p>Sometimes it's fun to read something because you're curious about it at that very moment. This is less systematic but I think that occurrent curiosity plays an important role in choosing what topics to read on. For me, it serves to explore books that may not be directly related to a project of mine, but could be …</p></section></div>

<p>How many times have you heard someone say they are data-driven or data centric or that “data is the heart of everything they do”? I’ve heard this so many times that the urge to wince is becoming irresistible. This sentiment is emblematic of a vanity that exists in the big data era – we are scientific, evidence based and use data to make our decisions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This slogan is heard at every company I’ve worked at and from a range of people whether they be CEOs or “thought leaders”. In this post, I want to explain why we’re not as data-driven as we’d like to think. There are mistakes I’ve noticed some otherwise very smart people make when it comes to looking at and making decisions based on data and I want to discuss some of them with the hopes of injecting some humility and skepticism into the discourse.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Before I begin, let me give the benefit of the doubt to those people who express this sentiment earnestly. I’m aware that people are well intentioned when they say this – they want to express the fact that they’re not exclusively guided by their experience, hearsay or whim when making decisions. They want to consider facts from the outside world and let this guide their thought process about a particular issue. As far as this goes – fine, but I contend that this sentiment is so general and fair-seeming that it goes without saying. Not many people would openly admit that they don’t like to consider the facts before making a decision.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I would go further and say those people who frequently want you to know how data savvy or data focused they are, do so as a way of sounding clever and giving legitimacy to whatever it is that they’re about to say next. Whenever someone tells me that they’re data-driven I inevitably lean in to hear what silly comment couched in technical sounding language is going to follow – it has the inverse effect that the author intended.<br></p>



<p>Let’s explore some of the common blunders made by data-driven decision makers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>No one has ever let data speak for itself – ever</h2>



<p>If a data tree falls in a (random?) forest, does it make a sound? Easy – no. This is an error I see made by non technical people or those who come from non scientific fields and love the idea of objective and bias free analysis. Too bad no one has ever done that in data science. Data cannot speak without an interpreter and that interpreter is always mischievous, seeking to mix in its own words.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>All data have assumptions and biases. Where we get our data from, the quality of our data and how we use the data for analysis all imbue data with a structure of which we have to be mindful. Even activities as simple as looking at a line graph carry assumptions that can trip us up if unchecked. There could be missing data, the time scale could not be homogeneous (have we skipped days?) or the data recorded could change scale halfway through. Even choosing which range of values on the x and y axis to show will have an impact on the user. These assumptions must be considered and made explicit if it is feared that they could mislead the end user. If not feared – do it all the same.</p>



<h2>Where your data comes from is as important as how much data you have</h2>



<p>The sad truth is that in practice, most of the data we have as data scientists is junk. Choosing what to ignore is important for meaningful analysis. More data does not equate to better analysis – especially if it comes from a source which is biased and unreliable, Garbage In Garbage Out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>I was once asked to model how some process evolves over time. The problem was that each data point was not measuring the same unit; our observation of some phenomena at time epoch 2 was not the observation of the same phenomena at time epoch 1. Therefore you were not measuring evolution of anything over time but rather making statements about independent data on different days. To illustrate this, consider the problem of measuring daily occupancy in a hotel – we count the number of guests in rooms every day and plot. However if we had daily occupancy data but each day reports a different hotel, then we cannot reasonably plot this on a (time indexed line) graph since we would not be looking at the occupancy rate of the same hotel over time.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This distinction is important and fundamentally shifts the robustness of our whole analysis. We have to interrogate carefully where our data comes from, what biases it might have and whether it is in the format we need to test our hypotheses.</p>



<h2>Just being skeptical doesn’t make you smart</h2>



<p>It is true that confirmation bias is real and there are many trigger-happy stakeholders who will make decisions based on one significant test in a sea of other non significant results (my views on significance testing in business might be in a different post). It pays dividends to be careful, demand more data and adopt a wait-and-see approach. A lot of times we build models and make predictions and the best thing to do is to wait for more data once we feel like we have effectively modelled a problem.<br></p>



<p>However there are people who sit on the other extreme and no amount of analysis is sufficient for them to act. They try to show how level-headed they are by making comments like “we need other data sources to better understand the problem”, “we need to synthesise our data to separate signal from noise” or “the data is out of date”. All these remarks are reasonable but in many cases they’re used as a justification for inaction.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The purpose of data work and experimentation should be to inform action. If you are hiding behind these excuses to not make changes which seem otherwise reasonable then you’re not being cautious, you’re being cowardly. If you don’t have a measurable limit of how much data will be enough for you to act (how this is determined is a different problem) or how you intend to separate signal from noise then you’re making this mistake.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s a tricky blunder to spot because it disguises itself as wisdom. If data analysis is used to repeatedly say no because stakeholders see no evidence that an action will be successful, they should go the whole way and not take any action – there is never going to be evidence of efficacy until after the fact. One telltale sign of this behaviour is how people conveniently depend on less data when there is a decision they want to make already. The criterion of evidence for ideas they dislike is far higher compared to the ideas they are favourable towards.</p>



<h2>Automation is not a substitute for thinking</h2>



<p>When you write code it helps to automate as much as possible. Putting models in production or scheduling scripts are very powerful tools which ultimately save time and effort. However there is a danger when we try to automate those decisions which require a domain specific understanding of a problem.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Natural Language Processing is full of problems which require a human to determine if the results make sense – from interpreting word2vec similarity outputs to validating the sensibility of text cleaning, there are some problems which require humans in the loop (for the time being). We can make the space for those humans small but we can’t fully automate it away at the risk of making our analysis meaningless. Clustering is another example where we can automate to a great extent but if the output does not make sense for the problem in question, it might be necessary to compromise on some performance metrics in order to gain interpretability.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>If it helps, I’ve formulated Junaid’s 1st law “Automate as far as possible, but not further”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sometimes it’s okay to ignore the data</h2>



<p>Sometimes it helps to take a risk and ignore what the data might be presently suggesting and go with your instinct. Frequent A/B testing can sometimes lead to users chasing local optima and not focusing on the big picture. If you gambled on a new product feature and early results have shown that users respond adversely, it might not necessarily be the case that it is good to discontinue it. Think about other benefits it might have for your business and users later down the line. It might be that after users have gotten used to the new feature, they begin to respond positively.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Ultimately there is nothing wrong with using intuition sometimes. The problem arises when we confuse our intuition as inference from data and behave with a false confidence. I have seen people deliberately masquerade their opinions as if they were inferences from data analysis and refuse to acknowledge that their views originate from their minds vs the external world. We should admit when we’re using our intuition and be open to being challenged if others have differing ideas.<br></p>



<p>There are more data sins but these are the main ones that come to mind. Hopefully I’ve illustrated the value of thinking through what we’re doing, checking our assumptions and realising that this enterprise is far more complicated than the buzzwords and slogans would have us believe.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2> Simplified view on How Certificate Signing works </h2>
    <strong>Tags: </strong>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Reference: <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/">https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/</a></p>
<h4 id="steps-for-signing-certificate-by-ca">Steps for signing certificate by CA</h4>
<ol>
<li>The Subscriber (the person asking a CA to issue them a certificate) sends a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the CA which contains all of their details like name, domain name etc.</li>
<li>The CA will then take a blank certificate and begins to fill in the details of the Subscriber, validating ownership of the domain along the way, until they have completed all of the fields in the certificate.</li>
<li>At this stage we have what we call the Pre-Certificate, it’s basically a finished certificate ready to issue but the only thing that’s missing is the CAs signature on the bottom of the certificate to make it official</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="signing-of-certificate">Signing of certificate</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li>CA takes Pre-Certificate and running it through a hash function, currently SHA256, to obtain the digest.</li>
<li>The second step is the CA then taking that digest and encrypting it with their private key.</li>
<li>This encrypted digest is the signature and once appended to the end of the file we now have a signed certificate that can be issued to the Subscriber.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rules public key encryption</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For every private key, there is only one corresponding public key.</li>
<li>Also Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding public key.</li>
<li>More rules and info at: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/">https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Q: How does adding the <strong>encrypted digest</strong> i.e. signature makes it signed certificate ?</p>
<p>A: It can better be explained by putting browser in picture and looking at what it does while requesting https website.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="what-browser-does">What browser does</h4>
<ol>
<li>During tls handshake with https endpoint, it fetches associate intermediate certificate and root certificate.
<ul>
<li>We need to upload intermediate certificate(public key of CA) and root certificate while uploading ssl certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browser now decrypts the digest using intermediate certificates, if it is able to decrypt using intermediate key, it means that above certificate is signed by private-key of CA(data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with it’s corresponding public key)</li>
<li>Browser itself also calculate hash of pre-certificate to compare with hash it got in step 2 after decrypting digest.</li>
<li>If both are correct means,
<ul>
<li>The signature definitely came from the CA. (Authenticity) - Step 2</li>
<li>The certificate has not been tampered with. (Integrity)  - Step 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Above is over-simplified explanation of what happens, above all is taken from 1st half of post at : <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/">https://scotthelme.co.uk/cross-signing-alternate-trust-paths-how-they-work/</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>Writing your resume for the first time or editing it for the 100th can both be incredibly daunting experiences. </span></p>
<p><span>With todayâ€™s fast-paced, ever-evolving corporate environment, hiring managers are consistently searching for unique candidates in an oversaturated market. </span></p>
<p><span>This makes resume writing so much more integral to landing a job that you want. </span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most hiring managers utilize applications called â€œApplicant Tracking Systems (ATS),â€� which help electronically filter through candidate resumes searching for keywords, required skills, and overall competency. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a job required Slack as a hard skill, and you fail to mention your proficiency within your resume, your resume will automatically be sorted out of potential applicants immediately. </span></p>
<p><span>That being said, making a point to highlight your skills effectively is essential to passing through the ATS successfully. </span><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that hiring managers are sent hundreds to thousands of resumes per job advertisement. After making it through the ATS, your resume will have approximately 6-8 seconds to prove your worth. </span></p>
<p><span>This means that you should ensure it looks professional and highlights the key information in bite-size pieces for quick reading and digestion. Your goal is to provide information and make the hiring process as painless as possible for the employer. </span></p>
<p><span>The following part of this article will walk you through several suggestions to better your skills section so that it will pass inspection and highlights you as a strong and capable candidate for the jobs you are applying. </span></p>
<p><span>These suggestions are: (1) Do not list given skills, (2) Spotlight key skills, and (3) Highlight your knowledge by separating hard and soft skills. </span></p>
<p><span>By incorporating these 3 modifications to your resume, youâ€™ve already created a great start to passing through the ATS and getting the hiring managersâ€™ attention. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #1: Do not list given skills</span></h2>
<p><span>Itâ€™s in our nature to want to name each and every skill we have in order to show that we are qualified, if not overqualified, candidates. Though this approach worked in the past, now itâ€™s more necessary to omit skills that would be assumed. </span></p>
<p><span>For example, previously it was necessary to indicate proficiency with technical skills including Microsoft Office and Google, however, now it seems redundant. In todayâ€™s technical climate, it is assumed that all applicants applying for positions have these commonplace skills. </span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that your goal of listing skills is to showcase your attributes, not bog down the hiring manager with information they already assume to know. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #2: Spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills</span></h2>
<p><span>The next suggestion is to spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills on each resume. This means that when applying to multiple jobs, ensure that you are adjusting your skills section based on the needs of the individual job. </span></p>
<p><span>Itâ€™s a great idea to use keywords and specific skills from the job description itself. If a requirement or specific responsibility is listed or has an apparent theme throughout the job description, use your skill section to highlight your ability to accomplish those tasks. </span></p>
<p><span>An effective way of doing this would be to rephrase their needs into your own voice and then adding that to your resume. For example, if the job description stated, â€œa strong background in CRM systems,â€� you could add, â€œProficient with CRM system,â€� within your skills section. </span></p>
<p><span>However, avoid copying and pasting only the skills outlined in the job description, as this could be seen as unimaginative and hurt your chances of candidacy. </span></p>
<h2><span>Tip #3: Emphasize the difference between soft skills and hard skills.</span></h2>
<p><span>Previously, it was simple to add a single skills section and be content with your resume. Now, it is necessary to emphasize both hard and soft skills. </span></p>
<p><span>Hard and soft skills are equally important to create a compelling resume. An ideal way to include both skills is to create two separate lists. This allows for a hiring manager to easily read through both skillsets. </span></p>
<p><span>Remember, you have 6-8 seconds to convince the hiring manager that youâ€™re a worthy candidate for the job. </span></p>
<p><span>In order to ensure balance across your resume, try to keep the number of skills on each list the same. For example, if you have 5 hard skills, ensure that you have 5 soft skills too. </span></p>
<h2><span>In Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>This article highlights 3 suggestions that you can incorporate into your skill section to make your resume stand out from others.</p>
<p>This includes: (1) do not list given or assumed skills, (2) take time to spotlight â€œkeyâ€� skills, especially those that are discussed within the job description, and (3) emphasize the difference between your hard and soft skills by giving each their own section.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>There’s a famous thinking framework by ‘futurist’, ‘forecaster’, and scenario consultant Paul Saffo called ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. The phrase itself became popular in tech circles in the 2010s — I remember reading about it on Hacker News or a16z.com or one of those thinky tech blogs around the period. It’s still rather popular today.</p><p>Saffo’s framework — laid out in his original <a href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">2008 blog post</a> — goes like this:</p><blockquote>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my search for further indicators and information. Iterate the process a few times, and it is surprising how quickly one can get to a useful forecast.<p>Since the mid-1980s, my mantra for this process is “strong opinions, weakly held.” Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the “strong opinion” part. Then – and this is the “weakly held” part – prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.</p><p>This process is equally useful for evaluating an already-final forecast in the face of new information. It sensitizes one to the weak signals of changes coming over the horizon and keeps the hapless forecaster from becoming so attached to their model that reality intrudes too late to make a difference.</p><p>More generally, “strong opinions weakly held” is often a useful default perspective to adopt in the face of any issue fraught with high levels of uncertainty, whether one is venturing a forecast or not. Try it at a cocktail party the next time a controversial topic comes up; it is an elegant way to discover new insights — and duck that tedious bore who loudly knows nothing but won’t change their mind!</p></blockquote><p>On the face of it, it all sounds very reasonable and smart. And ‘strong opinions weakly held’ is such a catchy phrase — which probably explains its popularity.</p><p>The only problem with it is that it doesn’t seem to work that well.</p><h2 id="swimming-upstream-against-the-architecture-of-the-mind">Swimming Upstream Against the Architecture Of The Mind</h2><p>How do I know that it doesn’t work that well? I know this because I’ve tried. I tried to use Saffo’s framework in the years between 2013 and 2016, and when I was running my previous company I attempted it with my boss, whenever we convened to <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/what-uncertainty-feels-like/">discuss company strategy</a>.</p><p>Eventually I read Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-forecasting-series/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, and then I gave up on ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’.</p><p>Why does the framework not work very well? From experience, Saffo’s approach fails in two ways.</p><p>The first way is if the person <em>hasn’t</em> read Saffo’s original post. This is, to be fair, most of us — Saffo’s original idea is so quotable it has turned into a memetic phenomenon, and I’ve seen it cited in fields far outside tech. In such cases, the failure mode is that ‘Strong Opinions, Weakly Held’ turns into ‘Strong Opinions, Justified Loudly, Until Evidence Indicates Otherwise, At Which Point You Invoke It To Protect Your Ass.’</p><p>In simpler terms, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ sometimes becomes a license to hold on to a bad opinion strongly, with downside protection, against the spirit and intent of Saffo’s original framework.</p><p>Now, you might say that this is through no fault of Saffo’s, and is instead the problem of popularity. But my response is that if an idea has certain affordances, and people seem to always grab onto those affordances and abuse the idea in the exact same ways, then <em>perhaps you shouldn’t use the idea in the first place.</em> This is especially true — as we’re about to see — if there are better ideas out there.</p><p>The second form of failure is if the person has taken the time to look up the original intention of the phrase. In this situation, the failure mode is when you attempt to integrate new information into your judgment. Saffo’s framework offers no way for us to do this.</p><p>Here’s an example. Let’s say that you’ve decided, along with your boss, to build a particular type of product for a particular subsection of the self-service checkout market. You both come to the opinion that this subsection is the best entry-point to the industry: it is relatively lucrative, and you think that it is the easiest customer segment to service.</p><p>What happens to your opinion when you <em>slowly</em> discover that the subsegment is overcrowded? Of course, you don’t find out immediately — what happens instead is that you spot little hints, spread over the course of a couple of months, that many competitors are entering the market at the same time. These are tiny things like competitor brochures lying in the corner table of a client’s office, or pronouncements by industry groups that “they are looking to engage vendors for large deployments”, and then much later, clearer evidence in the form of increased competition in deals.</p><p>“Well,” I can hear you say, “‘Strong opinions weakly held’ means that you should change your opinion when you encounter these tiny hints!”</p><p>But at which point do you change your mind? At which point do you switch away from your strong opinion? At which point do you think that it’s time to reconsider your approach?</p><p>The problem, of course, is that <em>this is not how the human brain works.</em></p><p>Both forms of failure stem from the same tension. It’s easy to have strong opinions and hold on to them strongly. It’s easy to have weak opinions and hold on to them weakly. But it is quite difficult for the human mind to vacillate between one strong opinion to another.</p><p>I don’t mean to say that people <em>can’t</em> do this — only that it is very difficult to do so. For instance, Steve Jobs was famous for arguing against one position or another, only to decide that you were right, and then come back a month later holding exactly your opinion, as if it were his all along.</p><p>But most people aren’t like Jobs. Psychologist Amos Tversky used to joke that by default, human brains fall back to “yes I believe that, no I don’t believe that, and maybe” — a three-dial setting when it comes to uncertainty. People then hold on to their opinion for as long as their internal narratives allow them to. Saffo’s thinking framework implies that you sit in ‘yes I believe that’ territory, and then rapidly switch away to ‘maybe’ or to ‘no’, depending on the information you receive.</p><p>Perhaps you may — like Jobs! — be able to do this.

I believe this on the order of 70% ish. Let’s check back in September.”</p><p>(My boss was an ex-investment banker, so he took to this like a duck to water.)</p><p>Tetlock’s stated technique was developed in the context of a geopolitical forecasting tournament called the Good Judgment Project. In 2016, when I read <em>Superforecasting</em> for the first time, I remember thinking that geopolitical forecasting wasn’t particularly relevant to my job running an engineering office in Vietnam.

<p>The first architecture is reminiscent of the map-reduce paradigm.
The idea is to split analysis into relatively simple indexing phase, and a separate full analysis phase.</p>
<p>The core constraint of indexing is that it runs on a per-file basis.
The indexer takes the text of a single file, parses it, and spits out some data about the file.
The indexer can’t touch other files.</p>
<p>Full analysis can read other files, and it leverages information from the index to save work.</p>
<p>This all sounds way too abstract, so let’s look at a specific example — Java.
In Java, each file starts with a package declaration.
The indexer concatenates the name of the package with a class name to get a fully-qualified name (FQN).
It also collects the set of methods declared in the class, the list of superclasses and interfaces, etc.</p>
<p>Per-file data is merged into an index which maps FQNs to classes.
Note that constructing this mapping is an embarrassingly parallel task — all files are parsed independently.
Moreover, this map is cheap to update.
When a file change arrives, this file’s contribution from the index is removed, the text of the file is changed and the indexer runs on the new text and adds the new contributions.
The amount of work to do is proportional to the number of changed files, and is independent from the total number of files.</p>
<p>Let’s see how FQN index can be used to quickly provide completion.</p>

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The user has just typed <code>Foo.f().</code>, and we need to figure out that the type of receiver expression is <code>Bar</code>, and suggest <code>g</code> as a completion.</p>
<p>First, as the file <code>Main.java</code> is modified, we run the indexer on this single file.
Nothing has changed (the file still contains the class <code>Main</code> with a static <code>main</code> method), so we don’t need to update the FQN index.</p>
<p>Next, we need to resolve the name <code>Foo</code>.
We parse the file, notice an <code>import</code> and look up <code>mypackage.Foo</code> in the FQN index.
In the index, we also find that <code>Foo</code> has a static method <code>f</code>, so we resolve the call as well.
The index also stores the return type of <code>f</code>, but, and this is crucial, it stores it as a string <code>"Bar"</code>, and not as a direct reference to the class <code>Bar</code>.</p>
<p>The reason for that is <code>import java.util.*</code> in <code>Foo.java</code>.
<code>Bar</code> can refer either to <code>java.util.Bar</code> or to <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
The indexer doesn’t know which one, because it can look <strong>only</strong> at the text of <code>Foo.java</code>.
In other words, while the index does store the return types of methods, it stores them in an unresolved form.</p>
<p>The next step is to resolve the identifier <code>Bar</code> in the context of <code>Foo.java</code>.
This uses the FQN index, and lands in the class <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
There the desired method <code>g</code> is found.</p>
<p>Altogether, only three files were touched during completion.
The FQN index allowed us to completely ignore all the other files in the project.</p>
<p>One problem with the approach described thus far is that resolving types from the index requires a non-trivial amount of work.
This work might be duplicated if, for example, <code>Foo.f</code> is called several times.
The fix is to add a cache.
Name resolution results are memoized, so that the cost is paid only once.
The cache is blown away completely on any change — with an index, reconstructing the cache is not that costly.</p>
<p>To sum up, the first approach works like this:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each file is being indexed, independently and in parallel, producing a "stub" — a set of visible top-level declarations, with unresolved types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All stubs are merged into a single index data structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution and type inference work primarily off the stubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution is lazy (we only resolve a type from the stub when we need it) and memoized (each type is resolved only once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The caches are completely invalidated on every change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The index is updated incrementally:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the edit doesn’t change the file’s stub, no change to the index is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>otherwise, old keys are removed and new keys are added</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Note an interesting interplay between "dumb" indexes which can be updated incrementally, and "smart" caches, which are re-computed from scratch.</p>
<p>This approach combines simplicity and stellar performance.
The bulk of work is the indexing phase, and you can parallelize and even distribute it across several machine.
Two examples of this architecture are <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> and <a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>The main drawback of this approach is that it works only when it works — not every language has a well-defined FQN concept.
I think overall it’s a good idea to design name resolution and module systems (mostly boring parts of a language) such that they work well with the map-reduce paradigm.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Require <code>package</code> declarations or infer them from the file-system layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forbid meta-programming facilities which add new top-level declarations, or restrict them in such way that they can be used by the indexer.
For example, preprocessor-like compiler plugins that access a single file at a time might be fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that each source element corresponds to a single semantic element.
For example, if the language supports conditional compilation, make sure that it works during name resolution (like Kotlin’s <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/platform-specific-declarations.html">expect/actual</a>) and not during parsing (like conditional compilation in most other languages).
Otherwise, you’d have to index the same file with different conditional compilation settings, and that is messy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that FQNs are enough for most of the name resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The last point is worth elaborating. Let’s look at the following Rust example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

    <span>fn</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// File: ./bar.rs</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>

<span>// File: ./somewhere/else.rs</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>T</span> <span>for</span> <span>S</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>// File: ./main.s</span>
<span>use</span> <span>foo</span><span>::</span><span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>bar</span><span>::</span><span>S</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.f</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, we can easily find the <code>S</code> struct and the <code>T</code> trait (as they are imported directly).
However, to make sure that <code>s.f</code> indeed refers to <code>f</code> from <code>T</code>, we also need to find the corresponding <code>impl</code>, and that can be roughly anywhere!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Certificate Transparency (CT) is a still-evolving technology for detecting
incorrectly issued certificates on the web. It’s cool and interesting, but
complicated. I’ve given talks about CT, I’ve worked on Chrome’s CT
implementation, and I’m actively involved in tackling ongoing deployment
challenges – even so, I still sometimes lose track of how the pieces fit
together. I find it easy to forget how the system defends against particular
attacks, or what the purpose of some particular mechanism is.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is to build up a high-level description of CT from
scratch, explaining why all the pieces are the way they are and how they fit
together. A lot of this material is drawn from a
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs253/lectures/Lecture%2012.pdf">guest lecture</a>
I gave with my colleague <a href="http://noncombatant.org/">Chris Palmer</a> as part of a
Stanford web security course (CT portion starts at slide 52).</p>

<h2 id="why-ct">Why CT?</h2>

<p>Certificate authorities (CAs) are the organizations that browsers trust to issue
certificates for domain names after checking that the person receiving the
certificate really does own their domain. CAs can be companies and governments
or the occasional non-profit. It’s fairly common for CAs to issue bad
certificates. Like any organization, sometimes CAs make mistakes, and sometimes
they are compromised or malicious. And sometimes certificates are issued
improperly without the CA doing anything wrong at all: a rogue insider, BGP
hijacker, or hapless vendor might request a certificate for a domain they do not
own.</p>

<p>The security community has invented various mechanisms to prevent browsers from
accepting these “misissued” certificates. For example, server operators could
once use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning">public key pinning</a> to
limit the CAs that could issue certificates for their domains, so that not just
any CA compromise would put them at risk. (Unfortunately, pinning turned out to
be a giant footgun, never gained widespread adoption, and is currently dying a
slow death.)</p>

<p>Preventing browsers from accepting misissued certificates is only one part of
the puzzle, though. It’s also important to detect misissued certificates. For
example, in 2011, an attacker hacked the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates">DigiNotar</a>
CA and improperly issued a wildcard google.com certificate, which they used to
target victims in Iran. While the Google Chrome browser didn’t accept the
certificate due to public key pinning, Google only
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/how-the-2011-hack-of-diginotar-changed-the-internets-infrastructure.html">found out</a>
about the attack by chance because a user posted about the error on a help
forum. This was a close call: would anyone have ever learned about this attack
if that one user hadn’t happened to report it?</p>

<p>Thus was born the desire for a technical means of detecting misissued
certificates. If a domain owner can detect an unauthorized certificate for their
domain, they can revoke<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> the misissued certificate. If the misissuance happened
because a CA misbehaved, the domain owner can report the incident to a browser
or OS vendor, who might choose to no longer trust the CA to issue certificates.</p>

<p>An unauthorized certificate for a domain isn’t the only type of misissuance. CAs
might create certificates that are bad because they use outdated cryptographic
algorithms, violate rules like the maximum lifetime of a certificate or specific
encodings that are supposed to be used, etc. If browser vendors could detect
these types of misissuances (which are not necessarily malicious, but signs of
bad hygiene), they could ask the CAs to fix these problems or even remove trust
in them if appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="a-strawperson-and-a-slightly-less-strawperson">A strawperson and a slightly-less-strawperson</h2>

<p>The very simplest attempt to allow detection of bad certificates would be to
require that CAs publish a list of every certificate they issue. They could
either directly publish their certificates themselves, or forward them to some
other service that publishes them. Domain owners could monitor every CA’s
published certificates for unauthorized certificates, and browser
vendors/researchers/etc. could monitor each CA for bad hygiene.</p>

<p>But the root problem we are trying to solve is that CAs might be compromised,
malicious, or error-prone, so we can’t just rely on CAs to publish their own
issuances. An evil CA issuing an evil certificate would simply not publish that
certificate.</p>

<p>In a slightly more robust system, CAs could submit each issued certificate to a
publisher. The publisher would return a signature on the certificate, and
provide a publicly accessible feed of certificates that it has seen. Browsers
would only accept certificates that come with a signature from a trusted
publisher. This is a little closer to what CT looks like, but there are still a
number of problems to solve.</p>

<h2 id="signed-certificate-timestamps">Signed Certificate Timestamps</h2>

<p>One minor wrinkle with this publisher signature system is that it takes time for
the CA to submit each certificate to these publishers and verify that it got
logged before issuing the certificate. (As will become clear later on, logging a
certificate can require operations on a large data structure and global write
consensus, which can take minutes or hours.) CAs don’t want other services’
potentially slow operations in the critical path of certificate issuance, which
is their core money-making business operation – and their customers don’t want
this slowdown either, since some web servers rely on fast certificate issuance
to meet business and uptime requirements. So in CT, a signature from one of
these publishers (which is called a CT log) does not actually guarantee that the
log has published the certificate. Instead, the log issues a Signed Certificate
Timestamp (SCT), which is a signed statement that the log has seen the
certificate and promises to publish it within 24 hours of the timestamp it
provides.</p>

<h2 id="trusted-logs"><em>Trusted</em> logs?</h2>

<p>So far, the system we’ve built up is as follows: CAs submit certificates to logs
as they are issued, and the logs return SCTs promising to publish the
certificate within 24 hours. Browsers don’t accept certificates unless they come
with SCTs from trusted logs. Interested parties, such as domain owners or
researchers, can monitor the data that the logs publish for malicious
certificates.</p>

<p>Now the key question is: why should we trust logs? If a CA could be compromised,
malicious, or error-prone, why couldn’t a log be compromised, malicious, or
error-prone too? One could even imagine a log and CA colluding to issue evil
certificates. The designers of CT wanted logs to be untrusted, and this is how
CT gets complicated.</p>

<p>As a simple way to remove trust from the logs, browsers could require multiple
SCTs from different logs per certificate. With this policy, an attacker would
have to compromise multiple logs to prevent an evil certificate from being
published by any of them. In practice, though, it’s difficult to say what
constitutes distinct logs. If the same organization controls multiple logs and
is colluding with the attacker, a multiple-log policy doesn’t help. Chrome
currently deploys CT with a “One Google, One Non-Google” policy: each
certificate must come with at least one SCT from a Google-operated log and one
from a non-Google-operated log, on the premise that it would be difficult for an
attacker to compromise two such logs. This policy, however, was always meant as
a temporary measure until something more technically sound and organizationally
neutral could be put into place.</p>

<p>To understand how to remove trust from the logs in a more technically sound way,
we need to think about a deep question: what does it actually technically mean
to “publish” a certificate? Each log has an API endpoint that produces a feed of
certificates – but, intuitively, providing the certificate on that endpoint to
one client at one particular point in time is not sufficient to have “published”
the certificate. To truly publish the certificate, that endpoint must provide
the certificate to anyone querying it at any time after the log signed an SCT
for the certificate. To verify that the log has truly published the certificate,
we need everyone to efficiently check with everyone else that they’ve seen the
certificate in the feed they’ve received from that endpoint. “Everyone” here
includes end-user devices that are validating TLS certificates, as well as
researchers, browser vendors, domain owners, and anyone else who is interested
in monitoring a log’s feed to look for misissued certificates.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not practical to ask everyone to maintain the list of all
certificates that each log publishes and check with each other to compare that
the entire sequence matches. That could be billions of devices each maintaining
sets of millions or billions of certificates. Furthermore, some of these
entities might be interested in only a very small subset of certificates; for
example, a domain owner is only interested in monitoring for misissued
certificates for their own domain, and has no interest in doing a lot of work to
help other entities verify that unrelated certificates were properly published.</p>

<p>Imagine that the log could produce a short summary of the sequence of
certificates that it has published. The summary is like a cryptographic hash: if
you can provide a sequence of certificates that produces a given summary, then
it’s infeasible to find any other sequence that produces the same summary.
Unlike a vanilla cryptographic hash, these summaries have two special
properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the log produces a summary, it can then add more certificates and produce
an updated summary, and efficiently prove that these two summaries are
consistent with each other, i.e. the latter summary’s underlying sequence of
certificates is a supersequence of the former’s.</li>
  <li>After adding a certificate, when asked for a current summary of the
certificates it has published, the log can provide an efficient proof that
the summary contains that certificate.</li>
</ol>

<p>This magical summary is all the state that anyone observing the log needs to
keep to be able to verify with everyone else that the certificates they care
about have been published. For example, a web browser validating a TLS
certificate can request a summary and a proof …</p></div></div>

          <p>On July 11th, around 5AM UTC, DeepSource was notified by the GitHub Security Team that they were tracking potentially malicious activity related to the DeepSource Github application.</p>
<p>The GitHub Security team had observed a large number of requests from unusual IP addresses for many distinct DeepSource users starting in mid-June, which stood out as anomalous. At this time, GitHub wasn’t sure about the source of the compromise.</p>
<p>By 7AM UTC, we had rotated all user tokens, client secrets and private keys. Since we didn’t know the origin of the attack, we also rotated all credentials and keys of employees who had access to production systems. Through internal investigation, we have not identified any unusual breach or behaviour, and have concluded that the DeepSource infrastructure has not been breached.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020 around 1:45 AM UTC, GitHub Security team got back to us with more information that could help identify the source of compromise. One of our employee’s GitHub account was compromised by the <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-14-sawfish-phishing-campaign-targets-github-users/">Sawfish phishing campaign</a> that targeted GitHub users - and the attacker gained access to DeepSource GitHub app’s credentials.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, GitHub’s privacy policy prevents them from sharing the affected user list with us, so we are disclosing this issue publicly while waiting for GitHub to complete their investigation. Our understanding is GitHub will notify the directly affected users as per their policies. You should visit <a href="https://support.github.com/contact?subject=GH-0000502-3963-3+Log+Request&amp;tags=GH-0000502-3963-3">https://support.github.com/contact?subject=GH-0000502-3963-3+Log+Request&amp;tags=GH-0000502-3963-3</a> and request logs from GitHub regarding repository downloads and other account activity to find any suspicious activity.</p>
<p>We’re always looking for ways to improve our security. From the moment we were first notified by GitHub, we involved industry security advisors. We have formed policies to conduct periodic security training and phishing drills for all employees, and will update these policies as necessary. Additionally we have started work towards gaining the SOC 2 Type 2 compliance certification, which will provide a path for third party auditors to ensure that DeepSource’s security practice exceeds industry standards. In the near future, we will be launching a security bug bounty program to provide the best security testers in the world with a chance to probe DeepSource for any weaknesses.</p>
<p>We have always taken great care to ensure DeepSource meets the security needs of our users. While the DeepSource application itself did not suffer a weakness in this situation, we are taking the steps listed above to ensure the security of our applications, our teams, and your data.</p>
<p>We appreciate GitHub’s swift response to this issue. Comments are disabled on this post due to the sensitive nature of it. If you have any questions, please reach out to us privately at <a href="mailto:security@deepsource.io">security@deepsource.io</a> and we will assist you in every way we can.</p>
<p>Note: We’ve notified all our users via e-mail with the same note on 20th July, 2020 around 10:40 PM UTC.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Imagine you wake up tomorrow in an empty white room, <em>a la</em> The Matrix. You don’t remember how you got there. <em>Anything can happen.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If Keanu Reeves appears, you’d probably think this is related in some way to the Matrix.
    <ul>
      <li>If Keanu appears and then Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) appears, you’d think—okay, this is almost definitely related to the Matrix.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On the other hand, if Obama and Clinton appear in your white room, in your head, you’d think, okay, the Matrix-related possibilities are less likely; the politics-related possibilities are more likely, whatever those are.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first few seconds in that empty white room, without knowing anything, everything is pretty much equally likely to us. In statistics, we call this a <strong>uniform distribution</strong>. It’s a good starting point when we know nothing. However, once we get new information, we shift probability mass from the less likely events to the more likely events, conditional on what we’ve just learned—in the Neo case, from Obama/Clinton related probabilities to Matrix-related probabilities; in the Obama/Clinton case, from Matrix-related probabilities to political event-related probabilities.</p>

<p>Often, in statistics education, we learn distributions in a vacuum of intuition. But, inevitably, we ask ourselves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do we use the statistical distributions we use? For example, why is the Normal Distribution everywhere?</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll find that statistical distributions aren’t pulled out of thin air. The statistical distributions we’re most familiar with—uniform, exponential, Normal—are exactly determined when we want to maximize our information gain from very simple and very few initial constraints.</p>

<p>We’ll find that we can use our intuition from the Matrix example to help us understand where these statistical distributions come from!</p>



<p>First, we need some intuition as to what expected information gain means.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the commonplace notion of an “average”. The average, in mathematical terms, is a sum of the value of each event weighted by the probability of that event occurring.</p>

<p>For example, if we have a rigged die with a heavy “six” side, we would expect the next value to be higher than the next value if we used a fair die. The higher frequency of occurrence of sixes pulls up the <strong>expected value</strong> (also known as the <strong>average</strong>, <strong>mean</strong>, or <strong>mathematical expectation</strong>).</p>

<p>Mathematically, what happens is we weigh the value of each event by the probability of that event occurring, and the sum gets us a rough idea of where the next numerical value will land.</p><p>

\[\text{mathematical expectation} = p(x) \cdot x \text{ for all } x \\ = \sum_i p(x_i) * x_i\]

</p><p>This basic concept of weighing things by the probability of those things occurring is a very useful concept. We can also weigh the <em>information gain</em> of an event occurring by the probability of that event occurring to get an expected information value across all the events we care about. But how do we measure information gain?</p>

<p>Intuitively we know that the more surprising something is, the more information it contains. In other words, <em>the informational value of an event is proportional to all the choices it killed off by virtue of that event occurring</em>.</p>

<p>The information value of an event is related to how much probability mass it moves versus itself once that thing occurs.</p>

<h2 id="leverage-can-be-surprising">Leverage Can Be Surprising</h2>

<p>One interesting way to think about this is leverage. Roughly, leverage means how much mass you move versus your own mass. In financial markets, if you outlay $1 million for $5 million of exposure, you’re levered 5 times. For our purposes, we want a good way to formalize our intuitional understanding of information; I haven’t seen information talked about in leverage terms elsewhere and I think it’s an… informative way to look at things.</p><p>

\[\text{leverage} \propto \frac{\text{exposure controlled}}{\text{initial outlay}}\]

</p><p>When we talk about “how much probability mass an event moves” or the amount of choices an event kills by virtue of its occurrence, this is in some sense a leverage ratio. What this looks like is the total amount of probability (normalized, we say 1, but it could just as well be some arbitrary sum, like 10000) divided by the probability of that particular event (p). The 10,000 factor cancels out when we divide the total by the individual probability, so we just get</p><p>

\[\text{info} \propto \frac{1}{p}\]

</p><p>Binary is, in a sense, the ultimate form of compression. Boiling things down to the most informative, basic essence of truth or falsity is a beautiful feature of a bit. We can count the number of bits needed to represent a value by taking its logarithm, base two, so we get</p><p>

\[\text{info} \propto \log_2{\frac{1}{p}}\]

</p><p>And if we weigh this by the probability of that particular event happening, we get</p><p>

\[\text{info} \propto p \cdot \log_2{\frac{1}{p}}\]

</p><p>And if we use the simplified version, we get</p><p>

\[\text{info} = p \cdot \log_2{\frac{1}{p}} \\ = p \cdot (\log_21 - \log_2p) \\ =-p \cdot \log_2p\]

</p><p>Awesome! We’ve built the definition of informational entropy from nothing other than a… bit… of intuition. Similar to our understanding for the mathematical expected value of a set of events, we can talk about the mathematical expected information for a set of events.</p><p>

\[\text{mathematical information expectation} = \sum_i -p(x_i) * \log_2{p(x_i)}\]

</p><p>Why is this useful? It turns out that the major statistical distributions maximize the expected information gain subject to certain constraints (each major distribution corresponding to different constraints).</p>

<p>Stated in a different way:</p>

<p>Take that our goal is to model the probability distribution for data we’re looking at.</p>

<p>We generally know a few things about the data—these will be our constraints—and we want to pick the probability distribution that maximizes our expected information gain (aka, maximizes our subsequent surprise, or <strong>entropy</strong>)—because if we had a distribution that had any less expected information gain than **the maximum entropy distribution, we’ve inadvertently encoded some information extra to our constraints into our distribution.</p>

<p>So the maximum entropy distribution is the closest thing we can get to a zero-knowledge guess, subject to what we know about the data (our constraints).</p>



<p>We found at the beginning of our journey that the uniform distribution—where we prescribe to each event an equal amount of probability mass—makes intuitive sense as the distribution we should pick when we don’t know anything at all. This isn’t saying that everything in reality has equal probability of occurring—a bit subtle; it’s just saying that, <em>given what we currently know</em> (assumed to be nothing), no one event is more likely than any other event.</p>

<p>What if we work from the mathematical end? What do we find if we just start out with very few, very basic assumptions and work forward?</p><p>

\[\text{information, the quantity we want to maximize: } \\ f(x)=-\int_a^b p(x) \cdot \log_2p(x)\,dx \\ \text{unity constraint: }g(x)=\int_a^b p(x)\,dx - 1 = 0\]

</p><p>In English, we want to maximize the information subject to the unity constraint, and we want to see what p(x) looks like.</p>

<p>Mathematically, we’re going to want to find the local extrema (local minima and maxima) of the information function along the unity constraint. Analogous to minimization and maximization in single-variable calculus, we want to find the points at which the derivative of our information function is zero along the constraint function. Intuitively, this should make sense—we want the extrema, and if the slope of the information function is (for example) greater than zero along the constraint, we would just walk along that direction, increasing our expected information gain along the way, all the while getting closer to a local maximum.</p>

<p>Finding where the derivative of f is zero along g is equivalent to saying the directional derivative of f along a vector s that lies on constraint g is zero.</p>

<p>Because the directional derivative of f along that vector s is zero, we know that the projection of the gradient of f on g is zero (aka, the dot product of the gradient of f and g is zero).</p>

<p>Therefore, we know that the gradient of f is parallel to the norm of the surface of g, so the gradient of f is parallel to the gradient of g.</p>

<p>In other words, the gradient of f is some scalar multiple of the gradient of g!</p>

<p>If we find where this occurs, we’ll have found the extrema.</p>

<p>If the above calc-related ideas sounds a bit unfamiliar, ping me at longintuition@protonmail.com so I know that there’s demand for me writing something on gradients.</p>

<p>Anyway, mathematically, we’re trying to do this:</p><p>

\[\nabla f(x) = a \cdot \nabla g(x)\]

</p><p>Which is equivalent to:</p><p>

\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial p(x)} = a \cdot \frac{\partial g}{\partial p(x)}\]

</p><p>Taking the derivative with respect to a function requires a bit of variational calculus, specifically the Euler Lagrange equation. Thankfully, we have some pretty easy functional derivatives here:</p><p>

\[\frac{-1-\ln(p(x))}{\ln(2)}=a \cdot 1\]

</p><p>Let’s simplify! We want to get an expression for p(x):</p><p>

\[-1-\ln(p(x))=a \cdot \ln(2) \\ 1 + \ln(p(x)) = -a \cdot \ln(2) \\ \ln(p(x)) = -1-a \cdot \ln(2) \\ \implies p(x) = e^{-1-a\ln(2)} \\ p(x) =e^{-1} \cdot e^{-a\ln(2)} \\ p(x) = e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a}\]

</p><p>We’ll plug this expression into our unity constraint:</p><p>

\[\int_a^b p(x)\,dx=1 \\ \int_a^b e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} \,dx = 1 \\ e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} \cdot \int_a^b \,dx = 1 \\ e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} \cdot (b-a) = 1 \\ e^{-1} \cdot 2^{-a} = \frac{1}{b-a}\]

</p><p>This looks like p(x)!</p><p>

\[p(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}\]

</p><p>which is the PDF of a continuous uniform distribution!</p>

<p>This is super promising—the probability distribution that maximizes our surprise given we know basically nothing aside from a unity constraint is the uniform probability distribution!</p>

<p>What we’ve just done is confirm mathematically a very solid intuition we explored at the beginning of the piece!</p>



<p>Very rarely do we know absolutely nothing about the data …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>
<h2 id="docker-network-theory">Docker Network Theory</h2>
<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-host-network-bridge">Single-host network bridge</h2>
<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

<p>Docker gives us possibility to integrate container network stack into host stack.<br>
In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

<p>It will create for us docker network - all containers connected to this network will be visible in docker host network as they were normal separate from docker host that host them machines.</p>
<p>Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>with MACVLAN you can easily exhaust IP adresses in your network</li>

July 20, 2020 | https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker-enterprise-ucp-security/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker-enterprise-ucp-security/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>In production environment we should care about security, also we want easy of usage.<br>
So, it is good to know docker security options and Docker Enterprise Edition.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide assume that we have got Docker Enterprise Edition installed on three node cluster. Most of features described here are paid ones, but we can get a trial of Docker Enterprise Edition for free - 30 day period.</p>
<p>How to do it?<br>
Look at official docs:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/ee/docker-ee/rhel/">Docker EE Installation</a><br>
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-trial">Docker EE Trial</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="security-overview">Security Overview</h2>
<p>Security components in docker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secrets - encrypted store for passwords and other sensitive data that can be publish to container</li>
<li>Docker Content Trust - singing images protect from man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
<li>Security Scanning - images in DTR can be scanned for security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Swarm Mode - most of swarm components are encrypted by default</li>
</ul>
<p>Security components in Linux which used by docker:</p>
<ul>
<li>seccomp</li>
<li>Mandatory Acess Control(MAC)</li>
<li>Capabilities</li>
<li>Control Groups(cgroups)</li>
<li>Kernel namespaces</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h4>
<p>Linux technology that gives us ability to slice OS into couple of logical OS’es.<br>
Docker container has got couple of own namespaces which are isolated from others and from docker host itself.</p>
<p>What namespaces are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process ID(pid) - isolation of process tree - every container hasw got own processes</li>
<li>Network(net - network stack isolation - interfaces, IP’s, ports etc.</li>
<li>Mount(mnt) - root(/) filesystem isolation</li>
<li>Inter-prcess Communication(ipc) - shared memory isolation</li>
<li>User(usr)(not enabled by default) - mapping non-root user on container to root user on docker host</li>
<li>UTS(uts) - isolating of hostnames and uname calls</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="control-groups">Control Groups</h4>
<p>Control Group will be used to set limits for containers resource compsumption.</p>
<h4 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h4>
<p>Linux capabilities gives us possibility to restrict certain calls to kernel from root user. Docker containers are running from root user which may lead to some dangerous situations.<br>
We can remove some capabilities from root user after running our containers to make docker host more secure.<br>
What can be capability?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CAP_CHOWN</code> - posibillity to do <code>chown</code></li>
<li><code>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</code> - binding low ports</li>
<li><code>CAP_SYS_BOOT</code> - rebooting host</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mandatory-acess-control">Mandatory Acess Control</h4>
<p>Well known Linux MAC is SELinux which we love to <code>setenforce 0</code> :)
We can start containers with SELinux policy applied - by default we get one which in most cases should be fine.</p>
<h4 id="seccomp">seccomp</h4>
<p>Profiles wchich can filter dangerous kernel calls from containers.</p>
<h4 id="swarm-security">Swarm security</h4>
<p>Swarm security includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto node ID</li>
<li>TLS authentication for nodes - certificate added to node after joining cluster</li>
<li>Secure join tokens - one for managers and one for workers</li>
<li>Encrypted DB with metadata</li>
<li>Encrypted management networking</li>
<li>CA and certificate rotation</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="check-tls-node-certificate">Check TLS node certificate</h6>

<ul>
<li><code>O</code> - Swarm ID</li>
<li><code>OU</code> - Swarm node role</li>
<li><code>CN</code> - Node ID</li>

<p>Docker EE includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Control Plane(UCP)</li>
<li>Docker EE engine</li>
<li>Docker Trusted Registry(DTR)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ucp">UCP</h4>
<p>UCP as mentioned earlier is web gui for docker. It is used to manage docker engine and some entreprise features - it is shipped as container for easy deployment.<br>
If we have Docker EE binaries installed we can deploy UCP with single <code>docker run</code> command. Before doing so, we have to be dure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all nodes will have set up NTP for time synchro</li>
<li>all nodes have got static IP address</li>
<li>all nodes have got resolvable DNS name</li>
<li>odd number of managers for HA(3 or 5)(5 is best option)</li>
<li>you have some VIP’s and LB - to round robin calls to UCP/DTR GUI</li>
<li>managers spread in multiple DC availability zones</li>
<li>all nodes meet requirements:
<ul>
<li>minimum:
<ul>
<li>UCP Manager with DTR: 8GB RAM, 3GB disk space</li>
<li>UCP Worker: 4GB RAM, 3GB disk space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recommended:
<ul>
<li>UCP Manager with DTR: 8GB RAM, 4vCPU, 100GB disk space</li>
<li>UCP Worker: 4GB RAM, 25-100GB disk space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For setup I advise to follow official docs, after following it we get swarm cluster created which is managed by UCP and DTR deployed on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/admin/install/">Docker UCP Setup Docs</a><br>
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/ee/dtr/admin/install/">Docker Trusted Registry Setup Docs</a></p>
<p>After installation we should se on manager node:</p>

<p>If you not familiar with moving around Docker Swarm Cluster and services look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://knowledgepill.it/posts/docker_swarm_compendium/">Docker Swarm Complete Guide</a></p>
<hr>
<p>What does this services do?</p>
<ul>
<li>ucp-agent - main UCP agent that is capable of scheduling containers on nodes</li>
<li>ucp-ectd - cluster persistent database</li>
<li>ecp-auth - authentication service which gives us possibility to enable SSO</li>
<li>ucp-proxy - control access to local docker socket</li>
<li>ucp-swarm - communication with swarm cluster on which UCP is deployed</li>
</ul>
<p>By default UCP creates some CA for internal and external connection.<br>
For production we can use our - ca.pem, cert.pem, key.pem - we can add certs when starting UCP with flag <code>--external-ca</code>.<br>
This flag will take volume name in which we have our certs. Volume should be named: <code>ucp-controller-server-certs</code>.</p>
<h4 id="accesing-ucp-dashboard---adding-new-node">Accesing UCP dashboard - adding new node</h4>
<hr>
<p>If we log in for the first time we shuold first upload liecnse file: <code>docker_subscription.lic</code>.</p>
<p>It can be download from Docker Hub from place where we have info about our  subscription.</p>
<hr>
<p>We should use: <code>https://&lt;docker_host_with_ucp&gt;:443</code> to access UCP.<br>
After log in we get dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="https://knowledgepill.it/images/docker_ee/1.png" alt="Docker EE Dashboard"></p>
<p>In Shared Resources -&gt; Nodes we can click Add Node:</p>
<p><img src="https://knowledgepill.it/images/docker_ee/2.png" alt="Docker EE Dashboard"></p>
<p>UCP will gives us command to add manager or worker to swarm:</p>
<p><img src="https://knowledgepill.it/images/docker_ee/3.png" alt="Docker EE Dashboard"></p>
<p>After using command UCP will deploy nessesery containers into new node:</p>

        <p>Serpent OS is (or at least, will be) a Linux distribution with notably different goals
from the mainstream offering. We’re in the process of establishing the project, with
development properly starting towards the end of July.</p>
<h4 id="naming">Naming</h4>
<p>Eventually our plan is to rebrand as ‘Serpent Linux*’ - however we will first need to
complete some early donkey work and apply for a sublicense to use the name. As explained
below, this is <em>not</em> Serpent ‘GNU/Linux’ as the distribution will not be dependent on
a GNU toolchain or runtime. For those who are curious, we’re working with an artist to
choose an appropriate logo for the project.</p>
<h4 id="aims">Aims</h4>
<p>The vast majority of Linux distributions have highly similar goals, and can be best
described using these common industry buzzwords:</p>
<pre><code>Modern, lightweight, privacy oriented/respecting, user-friendly desktop
</code></pre>
<p>We’re focused on building a Linux distribution that serves our own needs.
Chiefly, a Linux distribution for people who want to use Linux, not a “Linux-based-OS”
focusing on interoptability with macOS* + Windows*.</p>
<p>In a nut shell, this is <strong>not</strong> “Linux for the masses”. This is a project setting out to
use Linux as Linux should be used. This will in turn help us to build a significantly
advanced Linux distribution that is both modular and optimised for modern machines.</p>
<h4 id="a-truly-modern-linux-distribution">A Truly Modern Linux Distribution</h4>
<p>As we’re taking a distro-first, compatibility-later approach, our design decisions
will allow us to take some bold steps. We’ll also be able to incorporate all of the
more sensible design improvements in Linux distribution design over the last decade or
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more usrbin split</li>
<li>100% clang-built throughout (including kernel)</li>
<li>musl as libc, relying on compiler optimisations instead of inline asm</li>
<li><code>libc++</code> instead of <code>libstdc++</code></li>
<li>LLVM’s binutils variants (<code>lld</code>, <code>as</code>, etc.)</li>
<li>Mixed source/binary distribution</li>
<li>Moving away from <code>x86_64-generic</code> baseline to newer CPUs, including Intel and AMD specific optimisations</li>
<li>Capability based subscriptions in package manager (Hardware/ user choice / etc)</li>
<li><code>UEFI</code> only. No more legacy boot.</li>
<li>Completely open source, down to the bootstrap / rebuild scripts</li>
<li>Seriously optimised for serious workloads.</li>
<li>Third party applications reliant on containers only. No compat-hacks</li>
<li>Wayland-only. X11 compatibility via containers will be investigated</li>
<li>Fully stateless with management tools and upstreaming of patches</li>
<li>Lots, lots more. We’ll blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="opinionated-by-default">Opinionated By Default</h4>
<p>A recurring theme that holds back the development of world-class Linux, is high tolerance
for those holding Linux back. A perfect example is NVIDIA* and their lack of support for
accelerated Wayland support on their GPUs. Consequently, our project won’t tolerate such
decisions and will instead blacklist the NVIDIA proprietary drivers from the distribution.</p>
<p>There are other examples that will emerge over time, and will become quite clear.</p>
<p>The time for Linux distributions giving in, with thousands of man hours wasted working around
negative actors, had come to an end.</p>

<p>We will only accept community involvement via our IRC channel: <code>#serpentOS</code> on Freenode.
We will not operate a public bug tracker or forums. Once we are past out initial bootstrap
phase we will set up an email address to help reporting security issues to the team, and
we will of course release security notices.</p>
<p>In terms of feature requests, these will be largely at the discretion of core contributors.
When a company has been formed to house this project, we’re happy to hash out an SLA for
required works.</p>
<h4 id="timescale">Timescale</h4>
<p>It may seem incredibly odd launching a website before there is a distro to show off, however,
it became very apparent that the cat would be out of the bag, so we wanted to be prepared.</p>
<p>Currently, the Founder is in the midst of relocating to the Republic of Ireland. Once complete
we’ll move to stage2 of our bootstrap process and begin working on the tooling needed for the
base development.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-21839">
		
	
	<div>
		
<p>A very exciting thing happened recently in the 19H1 (Version 1903) release of Windows 10 – parts of the Intel “<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">Control-flow Enforcement Technology</a>” (CET) implementation finally began, after years of discussion. More of this implementation is being added in every Windows release, and this year’s release, 20H1 (Version 2004), completes support for the User Mode Shadow Stack capabilities of CET, which will be released in Intel Tiger Lake CPUs.</p>



<p><span id="more-21839"></span>As a reminder, Intel CET is a hardware-based mitigation that addresses the two types of control-flow integrity violations commonly used by exploits: forward-edge violations (indirect <code>CALL</code> and <code>JMP</code> instructions) and backward-edge violations (<code>RET</code> instructions).</p>



<p>While the forward-edge implementation is less interesting (as it is essentially a weaker form of <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html"><code>clang-cfi</code></a>, similar to Microsoft’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a>), the backward-edge implementation relies on a fundamental change in the ISA: the introduction of a new stack called the “Shadow Stack”, which now replicates the return addresses that are pushed on the stack by the <code>CALL</code> instruction, with the <code>RET</code> instruction now validating both the stack and shadow stack values and generating an <code>INT #21</code> (Control Flow Protection Fault) in case of mismatch.</p>



<p>Because operating systems and compilers must sometimes support control flow sequences other than <code>CALL</code>/<code>RET</code> (such as exception unwinding and <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/longjmp"><strong><code>longjmp</code></strong></a>), the “Shadow Stack Pointer” (<code>SSP</code>)&nbsp;must sometimes be manipulated at the system level to match the required behavior — and in turn, validated to avoid this manipulation itself from becoming a potential bypass. In this post, we’ll cover how Windows achieves this.</p>



<p>Before diving deeper into how Windows manipulates and validates the shadow stack for threads, there are 2 parts of its implementation that must be first understood.&nbsp; The first is the actual location and permissions of the <code>SSP</code>, and the second is the mechanism used to store/restore <code>SSP</code> when context switching between threads, as well as how modifications can be done to <code>SSP</code> when needed (such as during exception unwinding).</p>



<p>To explain these mechanisms, we’ll have to delve into an Intel CPU feature that was originally introduced by Intel in order to support “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">Advanced Vector eXtensions</a>” (AVX) Instructions and first supported by Microsoft in Windows 7. And since adding support for this feature required a massive restructuring of the <code>CONTEXT</code> structure into an undocumented <code>CONTEXT_EX</code> structure (and the addition of documented and native APIs to manipulate it), we’ll have to talk about the internals of that too!</p>



<p>Finally, we’ll even have to go through some compiler and PE file format internals, as well as new process information classes, to cover additional subtleties and requirements for CET functionality on Windows. We hope the Table of Contents, below, will help you navigate this thorough coverage of these capabilities. Additionally, when relevant, annotated source code for the various newly introduced functions is available by clicking the function names, based off our <a href="https://github.com/yardenshafir/cet-research">associated GitHub repository</a>.</p>





<h2 id="1-xstate-internals">XState Internals</h2>



<p>The x86-x64 architecture class processors originally began with a simple set of registers which most security researchers are familiar with — general purpose registers (<code>RAX</code>, <code>RCX</code>), control registers (<code>RIP</code>/<code>RSP</code>, for example), floating point registers (<code>XMM</code>, <code>YMM</code>, <code>ZMM</code>), and some control, debug, and test registers. As more processor capabilities were added, however, new registers had to be defined, as well as specific processor state associated with these capabilities. And since many of these features are local to a thread, they must be saved and restored during context switches.</p>



<p>In response, Intel defined the “eXtended State” (XState) <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developers-manual.pdf">specification</a>, which associates various processor states with bits in a “State Mask”, and introduces instructions such as <code>XSAVE</code> and <code>XRSTOR</code> to read and write the requested states from an “<code>XSAVE</code> Area”. Since this area is now a critical piece of CET register storage for each thread, and most people have largely been ignoring <code>XSAVE</code> support due to its original focus on floating point, AVX, and “<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-intel-memory-protection-extensions">Memory Protection eXtensions</a>” (MPX) features, we thought an overview of the functionality and memory layout would be helpful to readers.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the <code>XSAVE</code> Area was originally used to store some of the new floating point functionality like AVX that had been added to processors by Intel, and to consolidate the existing x87 FPU and SSE states that were previously stored through the <code>FXSTOR</code> and <code>FXRSTR</code> instructions. These first two legacy states were defined as part of the “Legacy <code>XSAVE</code> Area”, and any further processor registers (such as AVX) were added to an “Extended <code>XSAVE</code> Area”. In between, an “<code>XSAVE</code> Area Header” is used to describe which extended features are present through a state mask called <code>XSTATE_BV</code>.</p>



<p>At the same time, a new “eXtended Control Register” (<code>XCR0</code>) was added, which defines which states are supported by the operating system as part of the <code>XSAVE</code> functionality, and the <code>XGETBV</code> and <code>XSETBV</code> instructions were added to configure <code>XCR0</code> (and potentially future <code>XCR</code>s as well). For example, operating systems can choose to program <code>XCR0</code> <em>not</em> to contain the feature state bits for x87 FPU and SSE, meaning that they will save this information manually with legacy <code>FXSTOR</code> instructions, and only store extended feature state in their <code>XSAVE</code> Areas.</p>



<p>As the number of advanced register sets and capabilities — such as “<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/protection-keys.html">Memory Protection Keys</a>” (MPK), which added a “Protection Key Register User State” (PKRU) — grew, newer processors introduced a distinction between “Supervisor State” that can only be modified by <code>CPL0</code> code using <code>XSAVES</code> and <code>XRSRTORS</code> as well as “compaction” and “optimization” versions (<code>XSAVEC</code>/<code>XSAVEOPT</code>) to complicate matters in Intel-typical fashion. A new “Model Specific Register” (MSR), called <code>IA32_XSS</code>, was added to define which states are supervisor-only.</p>



<figure><a href="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM.png"><img src="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM.png" alt="" width="673" height="436" srcset="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM.png 1436w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM-300x194.png 300w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM-1024x663.png 1024w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.16.03-PM-768x497.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"></a></figure>



<p>The “optimized <code>XSAVE</code>” mechanism exists to ensure that only processor state which has actually been modified by another thread since the last context switch (if any) will actually be written in the <code>XSAVE</code> Area. An internal processor register, <code>XINUSE</code>, exists to track this information. When <code>XSAVEOPT</code> is used, the <code>XSTATE_BV</code> mask now includes only the bits corresponding to states which were actually saved, and not simply that of all of the states requested.</p>



<p>The “compacted <code>XSAVE</code>” mechanism, on the other hand, fixed a wasteful flaw in the XState design: as more and more extended features were added — such as AVX512 and “<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/09/18/processor-tracing">Intel Processor Trace</a>” (IPT) — it meant that even for threads which did not use these capabilities, a sufficiently large <code>XSAVE</code> Area needed to be allocated, and written into (full of zeroes) by the processor. While optimized <code>XSAVE</code> would avoid these writes, it still meant that any extended features <em>following</em> large-yet-unused states would be at large offsets away from the base <code>XSAVE</code> Area buffer.</p>



<p>With <code>XSAVEC</code>, this problem is solved by only using space to save the XState features that are actually enabled (and in-use, as compaction implies optimization) by the current thread, and sequentially laying out each saved state in memory, without gaps in between (but potentially with a fixed <code>64</code>-byte alignment, which is provided as part of an “Alignment Mask” through <code>CPUID</code>). The <code>XSAVE</code> Area Header shown earlier is now extended with a second state mask called <code>XCOMP_BV</code>, which indicates which of the requested state bits that were requested might be present in the compated area. Note that unlike <code>XSTATE_BV</code>, this mask does not omit the state bits that were not part of <code>XINUSE</code> — it includes all <em>possible</em> bits that <em>could’ve </em>been compacted — one must still check <code>XSTATE_BV</code> to determine which state areas are actually present. Finally, Bit <code>63</code> is always set in <code>XCOMP_BV</code> when the compacted instruction was used, as an indicator for which format the <code>XSAVE</code> Area has.</p>



<p>Thus, using the compacted vs. non-compacted format determines the internal layout and size of the <code>XSAVE</code> Area. The compacted format will only allocate memory in the <code>XSAVE</code> Area for processor features used by the thread, while the non-compacted one will allocate memory for all the processor features supported by the processor, but only populate the ones used by the thread. The diagram below shows an example of how the <code>XSAVE</code> Area will look like for the same thread but when using one vs. the other format.</p>
<p><a href="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM.png"><img src="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM.png" alt="" width="673" height="334" srcset="https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM.png 1804w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-300x149.png 300w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-1024x507.png 1024w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-768x381.png 768w, https://windows-internals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-13-at-11.12.57-PM-1536x761.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"></a></p>





<p>To summarize, which states the <code>XSAVE</code>*/<code>XRSTOR</code>* family of instructions will work with is a combination of</p>



<ol>
<li>What state bits the OS claims it supports in <code>XCR0</code> (set using the <code>XSETBV</code> instruction)</li>
<li>What state bits the caller stores in <code>EDX</code>:<code>EAX</code> when using the <code>XSAVE</code> instruction (Intel calls this the “instruction mask”)</li>
<li>If using the non-privileged instructions, which state bits are not set in <code>IA32_XSS</code></li>
<li>On processors that support “Optimized <code>XSAVE</code>”, which state bits are set in <code>XINUSE</code>, an internal register that tracks the actual XState-related registers that have been used by the current thread since the last transition</li>
</ol>



<p>Once these bits are masked together, the final set of resulting state bits are written by the <code>XSAVE</code> instruction into the header of the <code>XSAVE</code> Area in a field called the <code>XSTATE_BV</code>. In the case where “Compacted <code>XSAVE</code>” is used, the resulting state bits omitting bullet 4 (<code>XINUSE</code>) are written into the header of the <code>XSAVE</code> Area in the <code>XCOMP_BV</code> field. The diagram below shows the resulting masks.</p>

<h3 id="3-xstate-configuration">XState Configuration</h3>



<p>Because each processor has its own set of XState-enabled features, potential sizes, capabilities, and mechanisms, Intel exposes all of this information through various <code>CPUID</code> classes that an operating system should query when dealing with XState. Windows performs these queries at boot, and stores the information in an <code>XSTATE_CONFIGURATION</code> structure, which is shown below (documented in <strong><code>Winnt.h</code></strong>)</p>
<p><code><span>typedef struct</span> <span><span>_XSTATE_CONFIGURATION</span><br></span>{<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>ULONG64</span> EnabledFeatures;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>ULONG64</span> …</code></p></div></article></div>

<p><span>An AI reconstructs Newton's second law and discovers a previously unknown formula for mass calculation of dark matter. Can AI automate science?</span></p>
<p><img data-original-height="750" data-original-width="1000" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-szplR2iClwg/XxYB8fOPZxI/AAAAAAAAAdo/dMK2SWHh8fA910poJUTb7dwTC-b2w2euQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/Formeln-Tafel-unsplash.jpg" width="640"><span><br>At the core of science are two essential components: observation and logic. The former generates data from which we can then use logic to identify regularities and formulate them in the language of mathematics.</span></p><p><span>Once formulated, the mathematical formula is more than just a description of the data - it enables us to make predictions and discover previously unknown relationships.<p>Why mathematics is so well suited to formulating natural laws is unclear. This fact is "a wonderful gift that we neither understand nor deserve," wrote the theoretical physicist and mathematician Eugene Wigner in his essay "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences".</p><p>Without the interaction of data and mathematics, our civilization would never have arisen. But the more extensive the data, the more complex the relationships, the longer it usually takes to find a mathematical formula that correctly describes the regularities in the data.</p><p>If you want to read a linear function from the data in a two-dimensional coordinate system in math lessons, you can do it in five minutes - or quickly watch a video on YouTube.The situation is different for more complex tasks: Physicists, for example, have been trying to combine quantum theory and relativity theory for almost a hundred years. And if this succeeds, it could take generations to clarify the effects, says physicist Lee Smolin .</p><u>If AI is like Columbus, computing power is Santa Maria</u><br>Can artificial intelligence accelerate the discovery of mathematical descriptions? If it's possible to automate science with computing power , scientific progress could be bound by Moore's law and increase so much.<p>AI models can already be used to model complex data relationships and make predictions. At its core, the process is simple: collect data, train AI, and make predictions. This works for a face detector as well as for an AI that can predict the movement of three bodies in space with high accuracy . AI learns and discovers relationships.</p><p>But the black box neural network makes it almost impossible to understand what is going on inside the network. And even if an insight were possible, the representation of the learned relationships in a deep neural network is far from the mathematical descriptions sought.</p><u>Symbolic regression produces mathematical description</u><br>The method of symbolic regression can change that. It can be used to derive mathematical formulas from the internally represented relationships in the network .</span></p>
<p><span>Symbolic regression is carried out as a genetic algorithm. Equipped with variables and mathematical operators, the algorithm searches for the simplest mathematical formula with which known data can be reproduced.</span><img data-original-height="977" data-original-width="1000" height="624" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iReIJoL9TfQ/XxYAyF7OREI/AAAAAAAAAdY/FtIS975Qk50a_YLEY7ljLf7H_EyCdHcYgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/symbolic_regression_vyas_et_al.jpg" width="640"><span><br>To do this, it generates a large number of formulas, compares their predictions with the known data and only adopts formulas that approximate the real data. The surviving formulas are then modified and measured again against each other. At the end of the process there is usually an approximately correct reproduction of the existing data and a simple mathematical formula.<u>From basic equations of mechanics</u><br>Researchers have now used this method to describe the movement of particles and the mass distribution of dark matter . For this they use so-called neural graph networks (GNN) .<p>These neural networks rely on graphs instead of layers arranged one after the other. Graphs consist of several vertices , which are connected to each other ( edges ). A node contains information that is passed on to the neighboring nodes via the connections and thus changes the state of the receiver point. In this way, each node gradually receives information about the entire graph.</p><p>Neural graph networks are particularly well suited for mapping physical systems, since these often consist of the interaction between individual units such as particles . If, for example, the movement of several particles is to be predicted, the nodes store information about the individual particles such as coordinates, last direction of movement and mass.</p></span></p>
<p><span>A pair of nodes corresponds to two interacting particles. The connections contain information about the forces acting on the respective particles (nodes) from the neighbors. The entire system can derive the acceleration of individual particles. If the GNN is trained with a data set of corresponding particle movements , its mapping of the interaction of the particles becomes better and better .<p>The researchers led by PhD student Miles Cranmer have now trained a GNN and have used symbolic regression to derive the basic equation of mechanics - force is mass times acceleration - from the network.</p><p>Their result clearly shows that the mixture of data, neural graph networks and symbolic regression is actually suitable for extracting mathematical formulas - in this case an already known natural law - from data with AI .</p></span><br>
<span><br></span></p>
<p><span><u>Calculate dark matter with AI</u><br>Spurred on by this success, Cranmer and colleagues turned to a current area of ​​research in cosmology : they wanted to calculate a certain cosmological property (excessive density) of a dark matter accumulation depending on the properties of other dark matter accumulations in their environment.<p>Dark matter makes up about 85 percent of all matter in the universe, collects in huge structures and thus forms gravitational pools, so-called dark matter halos. The visible matter collects in these basins and forms stars and galaxies.</p><p>The researchers used the neural graphene network again. Each node contains information about a dark matter halo such as position, speed and mass and is connected to other halos at a distance of 50 Mpc / h. The network was trained with data from the <a href="https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/Quijote-simulations">Quijote Dark Matter Simulation</a> , a collection of generated dark matter structures.</p></span></p>
<p><img data-original-height="545" data-original-width="1000" height="348" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pwWin0kQTMY/XxYAx-RWnuI/AAAAAAAAAdU/uEX_AdGdusopljcMjGsb3ccPcPziPCRsQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/symbolic_regression_cranmer_et_al.jpg" width="640"><span><p>After the training, the GNN was able to predict the desired property of the halos more accurately than previous models. Using symbolic regression, the researchers were then able to produce a previously unknown mathematical formula that has a lower error rate than the currently most commonly used human-made formula for the same task.</p><p>The resulting formula was also better able to deal with previously unknown data. For Cranmer, this is a clear sign that the mathematical formula generalizes much better than the neural graph network from which it was derived. This coincides with our previous experience in physics, says Cranmer: "The language of simple symbolic models describes the universe correctly."</p><p>The success of Cranmer and his colleagues shows that the use of AI in research can lead to the discovery of previously unknown formulas . That would make the work of theoretical physicists easier. But the discovery itself is only the first step , after which the new formulas must be combined with known ones and derived. And we still need people to do that - for now.</p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-4aeb25cd="" data-v-469b7dbe=""><p>In a game of Sudoku you have to fill the numbers 1 to 9 in a 9x9 grid that is also divided into 3x3 boxes. Each row, column and box must contain each digit exactly once. A game starts with a number of given digits in the grid, and the player can use multiple techniques to deduct the missing digits.</p>
<p>Easy variants can usually be completed by using simple eliminations, i.e. all but one candidate are eliminated from a cell because the column, row or box already contains it. However, harder variants require using more complicated techniques where you eliminate candidates from cells in multiple steps.</p>
<p>Programming a Sudoku solver is not very difficult. Even though Sudokus are known to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku#Mathematical_context" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NP-complete</a>, because the <em>n</em> in a 9x9 Sudoku is fairly small, brute forcing a solution can be done in a few seconds. The more interesting task is to write a human-like Sudoku solver that uses human-possible techniques to identify the next move. In this post we'll discuss one technique that can be implemented using a fairly elegant graph algorithm. </p>
<h2 id="the-tuple-technique">The tuple technique</h2>
<p>Consider the following row of a Sudoku. Completed cells contain one big number. The other cells contain remaining <em>candidates</em> as smaller digits. </p>

<p>Cells 1 and 3 of the row can only contain the digits 1 and 9. The two possible solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in cell 1 and 9 in cell 3 or</li>
<li>9 in cell 1 and 1 in cell 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we can deduce that the digits 1 and 9 can <strong>never</strong> appear in any other cell in this row. This means we can eliminate the candidates 1 and 9 from cells 7 and 8. From now on we'll mark tuples as colored in cyan, and the cells with possible eliminations colored in purple.</p>

<p>We can generalize the rule by defining a tuple as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A tuple is a subset of cells in a row, column or box with size <strong>n</strong> that contains <strong>exactly n</strong> distinct candidates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the elimination rule can be defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a row, column or box with a tuple T, all candidates that are inside T can be eliminated from cells outside of T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we define that a tuple T is <em>useful</em> if T shares any candidates with cells outside of T.  </p>
<h2 id="drafting-an-algorithm">Drafting an algorithm</h2>
<p>Let's think of a naive algorithm to find tuples of size n with n distinct candidates. We have to consider tuples of all sizes with all possible candidate combinations:</p>
<pre><code>for each row, column, box
    for each size n between 2 and 8 
        // 1 and 9 don't make sense
        for each subset of the digits 1 to 9 with size n
            for each ... </code></pre>
<p>It is easy to see that our implementation has to involve a lot of nested loops. That's not a problem per se, but I find it hard to visualize it and thus it's not straight forward for me to write down. Instead, let's look at the problem from a different angle.</p>
<p>Consider an undirected graph, where the vertices are the cells of the row, column or box (that don't have a solution filled in). For every two cells that <em>share</em> a candidate, we'll add an edge. Let's look at our first example visualized as a graph:</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">component</a> is a subgraph where all vertices are connected directly or indirectly. If you start at any cell you can construct the component it's part of using a breadth-first or depth-first search.</p>
<p>We can see that tuples <em>have to be</em> part of a component as they need to share candidates<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. But how can we tell if the tuple is <em>useful</em>? Let's ask the opposite question: When is a tuple not useful? If it doesn't share any candidates with another cell, then the tuple must be <em>the whole</em> component. Here's an example:</p>

<p>If, however, the tuple is part of a bigger component, then it must be useful, i.e. there are candidates that can be eliminated. In our original case, the tuple helps us eliminate us 1 and 9 from the rest of the component.</p>

<p>Let's look at one more example. We can see that the 4789-quadruple allows us to eliminate the 9 from the purple vertex as they are part of a component.</p>

<p>With this knowledge at hand I found it relatively easy to write down the algorithm. Here's how it could look:</p>
<pre><code>for each row, column, box C
    let g be a graph where cells in C are vertices
    
    for each cell c1 in g
        for each cell c2 in g
            if c1 and c2 share a candidate
                create an edge between c1 and c2

    while g is not empty
        let comp be any component in g
        
        for each subset s of comp
            if size of s == number of distinct candidates in s
            and size of s &lt; size of comp
                return s  

        remove all vertices in comp from g</code></pre>
<p>You can find my own implementation of the algorithm on <a href="https://github.com/cypressious/vue3-sudoku-solver/blob/master/src/logic/strategies/tuples.ts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a> and the runnable application at <a href="https://sudoku-solver.rakhman.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sudoku-solver.rakhman.info</a>.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Technically, we can construct pseudo tuples that aren't connected where each cell only has one candidate, but then we could immediately enter the digit into that cell.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, there has been a lot of talk in my blog bubble about email self-hosting again (here is <a href="https://www.paritybit.ca/blog/a-month-and-a-half-of-self-hosted-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one example</a>, here is a <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/host-your-email-server.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second one</a>). I myself <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/mail-server/">switched to a self-hosted mail server</a> over a year ago, only to <a href="https://jlelse.blog/micro/2020/02/migrated-mailcow/">switch back to a hosted version</a> a few months later.</p><p>For me there were no technical problems running <a href="https://mailcow.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mailcow</a>, I was even quite happy with my setup. Nevertheless I switched because I realized that email is a topic where it’s not really worth hosting it myself. Neither is it much cheaper, nor does it bring me many other advantages. Both <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastmail</a> in the past and the <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hosted Mailcow</a>, where I have my emails now, are completely sufficient for my needs.</p><p>I don’t have to take care of anything myself and just have to make sure that the monthly automatic money withdrawal works successfully. No more updates, no more worries about my server suddenly going down and the backups not working. Someone else with probably more knowledge will take care of it now. And by having my emails hosted by the developer of the open source project mailcow, I support that others still have the easy possibility to host their emails themselves. And of course my emails are stored on a server in Germany and <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/email-own-domain/">I use my own domains</a> to send and receive emails.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><i>Designing the Mind: The Principles of Psychitecture</i>&nbsp;is the first book created by DTM. It is a psycho-philosophical self-development book that makes the bold claim that the human condition as you know it – is optional. That it is possible for you to unplug from your own mind, examine it from above, and modify the very psychological code on which you operate, permanently altering its limiting default patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Whether fear prevents you from pursuing your ambitions, jealousy ruins your relationships, distractions rule your life, or you have an inner critic whose expectations you are never able to meet, the psychitectural framework will enable you to understand and rewire the hidden patterns behind your biases, habits, and emotional reactions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>DTM will be your</span><span>&nbsp;handbook for mastering your behavior, cognition, and emotions, and&nbsp;</span><span>terraforming your mind into a truly delightful place to reside</span><span>.</span></p></div>

  <div>
    <div><p>A former coworker of mine was responding to customer support tickets one day. He was gathering information about a customer issue in order to figure out what was wrong. At some point during this process, his boss intervened and corrected the way he was responding to the support tickets. As a result of his struggles, at the next team meeting my coworker suggested we clarify our process for dealing with support tickets and customer issues. The response he was given, by the very boss who had intervened and corrected his behavior, was: "We don't want to introduce any unnecessary process."
</p><p>
I remember sitting in this meeting, watching his face fall, thinking that there probably couldn't be a worse response from a manager. His boss had, in one fell swoop, invalidated his experience by not acknowledging the problem and implied that he was trying to introduce "unnecessary process," which doesn't sound like a good thing. My coworker had encountered a genuine issue with our process for responding to support tickets and he wanted to improve it for the entire team. Instead of his input being welcomed, he was rebuked. 
</p><p>
Our fear of "unnecessary process" has created workplaces with something worse than bad process: no process. I call these types of processes "null processes," and they are rampant at startups and technology companies. In this article, I explain the concept of the null process, how it can hurt companies, how it can hurt diversity, and ideas for putting in place good process.

    <h2>What is a Null Process?</h2>
  </p>
  
  
  <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.kateheddleston.com/images/empty.png" id="1428388432254_null_pointer_2" alt="An image of a null pointer. A pointer pointing to nothing." title="An image of a null pointer. A pointer pointing to nothing." size="large">
      
      
  </p>
  
  
  <div>
    <div><p>A null processâ€”which takes its name from the concept of null pointersâ€”is what happens when no formal process is put in place. A pointer in computer programming is an object that points to a location in computer memory with meaningful information; it could point to a number, a letter, or even another pointer. A null pointer "points definitively nowhere" [<a href="http://c-faq.com/null/null1.html" target="_blank">1</a>]. A null pointer is an apt analogy because while it points nowhere, you still have the pointer object which, if used incorrectly, can crash your program.
</p><p>
When people say they don't want process, what they're really saying is they don't want <em>formalized</em> process. There is really no such thing as "no process." A process is simply the steps it takes to complete a task, so if a task is completed then by definition a process was used. Without formalized process everyone does things their own way, and there is no documentation for how problems are solved. This informal, undocumented process is the "null process," and, if used incorrectly, the null process can have major implications for a company.

    <h2>How is the null process bad for companies?</h2>
  </p>
  
  
  <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.kateheddleston.com/images/empty.png" id="1428361999234_expectations" alt="Sign that says &quot;Danger, expectations ahead!&quot;" title="Sign that says &quot;Danger, expectations ahead!&quot;" size="large">
      
      
  </p>
  
  
  <div>
    <div><p>The biggest danger with a null process is that it creates an environment of unspoken expectations. Most of the time, people have expectations about how a task should be completed. In the introductory story, when my coworker was responding to support tickets it became clear that there was an expected way that he should complete the task. His boss intervened to correct what he was doing, yet my coworker and the rest of the team was unaware that there was an expected way to respond to support tickets. 
</p><p>
Managing with unspoken expectations is dangerous. How can employees perform to a manager's standards if they don't know what's expected of them? Saying these expectations out loud in a one-off situation means that some people might know what's expected and others don't. How can you compare the job performance between employees who know the unspoken processes and those who don't? Additionally, the more time an employee spends getting their boss to tell them all the unspoken processes for their job, the more likely they are to be successful at the company. But that seems like an inefficient use of the employee and the manager's time.
</p><p>
A lot of companies end up with null process because they're afraid of bad process. There is this myth that having no process is liberating and that it frees people up to solve problems the best way possible. While that might be true on a very small, flexible, early-stage team, as a company grows the null process quickly becomes a hindrance. Undocumented process is extremely difficult to teach to new employees, making onboarding and team growth more expensive. The null process can easily transform into unspoken expectations that things are done a certain way, even though the company has not documented the implicitly understood process for completing a task. As Jo Freeman says in her famous essay <em>The Tyranny of Structurelessness</em>, "For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit" [<a href="http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm" target="_blank">2</a>]. By relying on implicit processes, companies are creating environments with unspoken expectations that can make it difficult for employees to succeed at their jobs.

  <div>
    <div><p>A lawsuit was recently filed against the fast-growing tech company, Twitter. Tina Huang, a software engineer there from 2009 to 2014, alleges that Twitter's lack of formalized promotion process created an unfair advantage for men. She was passed over for promotion twice without explanation, and despite the fact that she had excellent references, a proven track record, and an absence of criticism or disciplinary actions. Her complaint states that â€œ[t]he companyâ€™s promotion system creates a glass ceiling for women that cannot be explained or justified by any reasonable business purpose, because Twitter has no meaningful promotion process for these jobs: no published promotion criteria, nor any internal hiring, advancement, or application processes for employeesâ€� [<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/22/twitter-gender-discrimination-lawsuit/" target="_blank">3</a>].
</p><p>
It is almost impossible to evaluate bias in a null process. In Twitter's case, the lack of a formal process for promotion is left-over from their startup days. By not having a process for promotion, a company can inadvertently let subconscious biases run rampant. Everyone has <a href="https://kateheddleston.com/blog/social-norms-and-gendered-expectations" target="_blank">unconscious biases and expectations</a>, whether we mean to or not, and these biases can harm our perception of people's credibility. Unconscious biases are thought to be the source of a lot of the gender and race discrimination that happens at companies. By not clarifying what criteria people need for a promotion, Twitter may have inadvertently created an informal promotion process that favored men.

    <h2>How do we solve it?</h2>
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>Improving process at a company doesn't mean you have to add a bunch of cumbersome, unnecessary process. A process doesn't have to be this terrible beast where people fill out 4 forms to complete some small part of their job. Good process is light-weight and includes just enough information to help people understand how to do a task correctly. Processes can be flexible, reasonable for the task and the size of the company, and even kind of fun. Engineers actually love processâ€”Github is an entire website dedicated to engineering processes, after all. Here are a couple of ways you can start implementing reasonable, good process at your company.

    <h2>Checklists</h2>

  </p>
  
  
  <div>
    <div><p>Checklists might seem like a trivial or silly solution to process related problems, but historically checklists have had a powerful impact in a lot of fields. It was checklists that made the unflyable B-17 bomber flyable. Checklists that reduced line infections in the Johns Hopkins ICU from 11% to 0%. And many, many checklists that make building incredibly complicated skyscrapers and hospitals possible. As Atul Gawande says in his book <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em>:
</p></div><div><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right-ebook/dp/B0030V0PEW/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=" target="_blank'>4</a>].
</div>
<br>
Checklists are also relatively low overhead to create, and anyone can write or edit a checklist. You can start creating checklists for how code is merged and deployed. How someone is promoted to a people manager role. How someone can become a senior engineer. Etc. Let people add to them so they adapt over time to include things that you didnâ€™t initially think of, or to remove elements that aren't essential to the process. Like a code base thatâ€™s patched up by many people over the years to cover edge cases, checklists can grow organically to help people understand the basic steps necessary for completing tasks in your organization.

<div class=" post-item"="">Finally, allow your processes to evolve. Let process improvement be a collaborative effort and welcome participation from any and all employees. "People resist change that is imposed on them. But if they help define the changes, they will own them" [</a><a href="https://hbr.org/2012/09/understanding-fear-of-process-improvement" target="_blank">5</a>]. Let employees at your company own change by encouraging them to suggest solutions to problems they encounter day-to-day. If you don't think a suggested solution is the best solution, work with them to find a better solution. Try to avoid telling coworkers or employees, "we don't want to introduce unnecessary process." Great products are made through collaboration and iteration, and so is great company process.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p>Process is a necessary and crucial part of any organization. Our fear of bad and unnecessary process has led many companies to reject process altogether. But null processes are just a subcategory of bad processes, and they can lead to problems with communication, unspoken expectations, and discrimination. Instead, companies should aim for good process. Good process is light-weight, responsive, and serves to inform people of the minimum number of steps needed to do a task correctly. The pursuit of good process can be creative, flexible, and iterative, and employees should feel empowered to change and improve processes they deal with every day. The null process is a dangerous trap for organizations, and companies should work to collaboratively pursue good process and create a better work environment for employees and diversity.

<div id="adsense-target">
<p><span>Dictation instead of programming: Developer Sharif Shameem takes advantage of the quick grasp of OpenAI's speech AI GPT-3 and teaches it rudimentary web development with two examples.</span><img data-original-height="803" data-original-width="1000" height="512" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MA-6-FymqGQ/XxX3w9SV3sI/AAAAAAAAAdI/Fa56J_IphdIyCI8YrQYSS9easXpOwDgdACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/GPT-3-Frontend-Beispiel.jpg" width="640"><span><br>In early 2019, OpenAI introduced the language AI GPT-2, on the basis of which developer Jacob Jackson developed the code editor Deep TabNine : It offers AI-based auto-completion for programming code .<p>Jackson only had to train GPT-2 with source codes from the GitHub database and the AI ​​could recognize for 22 programming languages which command would probably have to appear next in a line of code .</p><p>Deep TabNine showed that language AIs like GPT-2 are more than text generators. Programmers were enthusiastic and described the AI ​​addition as "amazing", "crazy" and "incredible".</p><u>Programming with AI - level two</u></span></p><div>
<p><span><u><br></u>In May 2020, OpenAI launched GPT-3 . The successor to GPT-2 is a hundred times larger, writes even better texts - and is, particularly important, suitable for so-called Few-Shot-Learning (explanation) : GPT-3 masters new tasks with just a few training examples instead of those for Deep TabNine, for example necessary two million excerpts of code.<p>This adaptability also comes about through the comprehensive basic training: While 40 gigabytes of text from the online platform Reddit were used to train GPT-2, GPT-3 is trained with a total of 570 gigabytes of text .</p></span></p><p><span>Part of the huge data set comes from the Common Crawl text archive. The non-profit organization has been systematically collecting Internet texts since 2011 - regardless of whether it's a blog post, Reddit comment or just a code example.<u>Websites on demand: GPT-3 as a web developer</u></span></p>
<p><span>Computer specialist Sharif Shameem has now trained a kind of AI front-end developer via the newly available commercial GPT3 interface . Frontend developers mainly build user interfaces for an app or a website. Shameem only needed two code examples for the AI training , which he fed GPT-3.</span></p>
<p><span>Following these two simple examples, GPT-3 can generate JSX code based on well-written descriptions . For example, when entering “One button for each color of the rainbow”, the AI ​​writes the appropriate JSX code for seven differently colored buttons.<p>The voice command "A table of the richest countries in the world with the columns Name and BiP" generates a corresponding table. The sentence “A button the color of Donald Trump's hair” produces a yellow button.</p><p>The same results are also possible for pure HTML and CSS code, Shameem writes. All that would be needed to train the AI ​​were two other corresponding code examples.</p><u>Fast learner AI: The trick is diverse pre-training</u><br>The extensive pre-training of GPT-3 is what makes Shameem's programming AI possible. While Deep TabNine had to be trained with a large number of code examples , GPT-3 already has the basic understanding of code and language.<p>With just a few examples, AI only needs to point a finger in the right direction to convert voice commands into suitable code. In addition, she has more context knowledge in the neural network thanks to extensive preliminary training - such as Trump's hair color.</p><u>No developer has yet to fear for his or her job</u><br>Shameem's example shows that OpenAI's GPT-3 brings us closer to a future where developers can tell the computer - even literally - what code to write instead of typing line by line . Deep TabNine inventor Jackson describes AI-based programming as his vision of the future.<p>Jobs will not replace an AI tool like Shameem's for the time being, but will simplify and speed up the work of developers by quickly rudimentary code.</p><p>In the long term, AI tools could revolutionize developer work wherever repetitive programming tasks are commonplace. In addition to web front-end professionals, this also applies to back-end developers, according to Shameem. You would have to "prepare for a wild ride".</p><p>Based on his GPT-3 experience, the developer even assumes that a general, versatile AI can be reached in less than ten years - previously he had predicted more than 50 years.</p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Purchased a convenient bundle <em>a few years ago</em>. Time passes, and nearly forgot about the book and course.
Priorities. Life. You know, first world problems.</p>
<p>Resumed the course, this time for real, and I’m trying to motivate myself by taking notes about my learnings.</p>
<p>Buy it here <a href="https://devmarketing.xyz/">Marketing for Developers – advice for programmers, software, and SaaS</a></p>
<hr>

<p>“Build the right product”, sounds cliché, but that’s the hard truth.</p>
<p>“Build something people want” is another often used quote.</p>
<p>If your product gets recommended by other people, by word of mouth, it’s even better. That’s when you know you hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Don’t fall in love with your ideas. Validate them first, ASK the right people if they would be interested and if they are solving a problem they are having in a different way.</p>
<p>“Inspiration doesn’t always lead to great products”.</p>
<p>Don’t focus on the idea, or on yourself. Focus on the customer and if your idea could solve a problem they are actually struggling with.</p>
<p>Talk to people. Talk. to. people.</p>
<p>If you want to do good marketing, find an actual problem people have, and that they will pay you to solve it.</p>

<p>Not all markets or niches are the same, in terms of customers willing to pay for your product.</p>
<p>Evaluate if a specific customer base are motived to spend money, acquisition of potential customers is feasible, and that the niche is big enough to bring home some $$$.</p>
<p>Find customer for whom you want to work.</p>
<p>Get started by determining topics you’re passionate about, evaluate a good market (are they willing to pay).
Do your research, don’t necessarily look at competitors, look at the issues your potential customers face, and if you can solve their problem(s).
Now you can decide wether it could be worth to build a product for them or not.</p>
<p>Remember: you build a product for THE CUSTOMER. Not for yourself. Not to try a fancy new framework/library/technology.</p>
<p>FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER, damnit.</p>
<p>Try to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the market quite easy to reach (socials, cold calling, email, others)</li>
<li>does the market have buying power?</li>
<li>are your potential customers willing to improve the way they work?</li>
<li>is the market too small and profits could be difficult to achieve?</li>
<li>do you like working and solving the problems your customers are having? are you passionate about the niche?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>don't start a recipe book if you hate cooking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JTBD (acronym for "Jobs to be done")</p>
<p>Theory for getting a grasp what brings customer to buy your product.</p>
<p>It tries to focus on THE CUSTOMER's needs, pain-points in their process and daily activities.</p>
<p>To be able to understand your customer's needs, you need to understand their daily routine, repetetive and time-consuming tasks, and if they're motivated to change their process.</p>
<p>Do customer interviews. Ask people what issues they're facing on a dayly basis.</p>
<p>Additionally, look how the potential customer's are behaving (e.g. social media, blogs) and what bring users to a certain purchase.</p>

<p>What do your potential customers really want?</p>
<p>Only if you bring them valuable and actual problem-solving solutions, you could have <em>a chance</em> of getting a new potential customer on board.</p>
<p>Find pain-points, patterns, common problems faced by potential customers.</p>
<p>Hang out on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook with people from a certain niche. Use #hashtags, /r/subreditts and join a few interesting groups to discuss and observe patterns and problems users are facing.</p>
<p>Write down a hypthesis of the patterns you recognized and a theory about what the customer wants. One sentence.</p>
<p>Look at it. Does it make sense? Is it actually the biggest hurdle users are facing?</p>
<p>Now create a landing page, with focus on the pain-point. Do people sign up and click on the call-to-action button?</p>
<p>If you can provide a free guide to something. If people sign up for a free resource, maybe they're interested at your solution ot their problem after all.</p>
<p>Now. Ask people if they would buy (the product you're advertising on a landing page, a working prototype, etc).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you pay for this if it existed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now build. Notice that until now you barely touched code?</p>

<p>If you find something people don't like and want it to be easier, you've found a struggle people have. That could be a good start.</p>
<p>Additionally, choose a market in which you something about. If you're a complete noob in that field, you are going to have a hard time</p>
<p>To be a product person, you need to humble and follow the servant's mindset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What do customers need? How can I help them?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself: how painful is this struggle a user is facing?</p>
<p>You can categorize it with:</p>
<ul>
<li>extreme pain</li>
<li>moderate pain</li>
<li>low pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the answer, you'll understand how likely a user is willing to pay, and how much.</p>
<p>For extreme pain, pull marketing should be alright (SEO + SEM)</p>
<p>Moderate pain: Push &amp; pull marketing</p>
<p>Low pain: lots of pull marketing</p>
<p>Inverse relation between intensity of pain and number of exposures to a user!</p>
<p>Extreme pain, low exposures. Low pain, high exposures.</p>

<p>Get data, don't miss out on opportunities to get people signup to a mailing list.</p>
<p>Create a simple landing page, helps to concentrate of what <em>your users want</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marketing is about testing, analyzing the data and then iterate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start with</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Webmaster tools</li>
<li>Any analytics service (Segment, Google Analytics, Plausible Analytics)</li>
<li>Optionally set up an A/B testing tool</li>
<li>Set up a mailing list</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>My email list is my most important asset - Nathan Barry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many types of marketing channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>word of mouth</li>
<li>ads</li>
<li>partnerships</li>
<li>events</li>
<li>sales</li>
<li>seo</li>
<li>content marketing</li>
<li>email marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>What seems to work really well are content and email marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>blogging, videos, landing page</li>
<li>interest-based mailing-list, weekly newsletters</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Across all markets, email consistently outperforms other channels</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Landing page</h2>
<ul>
<li>primary goal: mailing list</li>
<li>then, get people to buy</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective landing page</p>
<ul>
<li>headline, what advantages does this product bring to the customer
<ul>
<li>what is their main struggle, how do we solve it</li>
<li>focus on the customer struggle, using "you"</li>
<li>use verbs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>body
<ul>
<li>visuals near top, engagement with nice image</li>
<li>what are the benefits?</li>
<li>social proof</li>
<li>describe your features</li>
<li>call to action</li>
</ul></li>
<li>footer
<ul>
<li>Who made this site</li>
<li>contact</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>focus on the words.</p>

<p>Similarly to launching a product, you need to do research, find pain points your audience has and wants to know more about. Then make the content reach people through marketing.</p>
<p>Ideally</p>
<ul>
<li>one pain point per blog post</li>
<li>follow trends?</li>
<li>make people feel comfortable, make it relatable, make them laugh</li>
<li>teach something new</li>
<li>unique content, shows trust</li>
<li>engage with people</li>
</ul>

From all appearances it doesn’t appear to be a technical hack, but a social engineering hack of employees with almost limitless access to the platform.</p><blockquote><p>As centralized tech companies have become the norm for political, economic and public health discourse a new threat model has reared it’s head. Centralized systems have centralized admins.</p></blockquote><p>Those centralized admins (the humans) and their related systems are one of the biggest security holes in these systems. Moderators and administrators have a wild amount of power. And that power can be manipulated by manipulating the humans instead of the tech.</p><p>I’m sure twitter will come out with some post-mortem statement about how they are securing their admin panels, yadda yadda. But the reality remains that centralized tech will always have centralized admins. This vulnerability is not trivial.</p><p>Nuclear superpowers have had this issue and have had to go to incredible lengths to mitigate the threat. Even their procedures seem a bit weak and rely on layers of physical security for the individuals and systems involved (literally people in bunkers).</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVZmFISzqwY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Moderators at social media companies have been shown to not be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21255870/facebook-content-moderator-settlement-scola-ptsd-mental-health">the most mentally stable individuals</a>. Tech workers are often easily blackmailed. People are a security threat that is not easily modeled or mitigated at a monolithic platform.</p><h2 id="the-obvious-solution">The Obvious Solution</h2><p>A solution to this problem is pretty obvious. Reduce the power of any single admin. Even in the nuclear bunker, one officer can’t launch the missile. One of the most effective ways to do this is by decentralizing out communications platforms.</p><p>For example, government leaders online statements should probably come from a government domain, government IP address and be signed by a public / private key combination. We have plenty of tools to do this type of work. RSS would work just fine and allow a authentication trail that everyone from media outlets to private individuals could use to validate posts.</p><p>Of course whitehouse.gov security would still be only as good as the administrators there. But, if the security there is compromised only whitehouse.gov is compromised. A mass pawning of hundreds or thousands of influential information sources becomes non-trivial and near impossible.</p><p>This is not just a suggestion for very large organizations but also for smaller ones. My local police department disseminates public safety information on Facebook. When there was a SWAT team on my block, the only way for me to get information was by looking on Facebook.</p><p>Having to opt-in to Facebook to get public safety information has it’s own serious issues. But on top of that, what happens if hundreds of police department’s social media accounts are compromised simultaneously and say… announce martial law?</p><p>The web is better and more secure when no one person holds the keys.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>“Renouncing the world” ceases to be an achievement and becomes a temptation as Progress progresses.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;-Don Colacho</p>
<p>I’ve had Salvia trips in the middle of the forest at dusk, during which a fifth dimension opened behind me and clowns at a supernatural carnival began mocking me. I felt less alienated from society when that happened than I do lately. What do you do when the world around you stops making sense and people seem to have collectively lost their minds? Some people just decide to lock themselves up in their homes and start reading fantasy novels and playing video games. I don’t really do that, because I get nothing concrete in return for that.</p>
<p>Rather, I generally just look for some ways to earn money. That might sound shallow and vain, but I’m in an era of my life where I become practical and realistic. I don’t like the concept of being forced to work. In addition to this, there is a range of things I like to do with my life, as I grow older the range of things that require cash begins to expand. As a teenager I could entertain myself simply by staring at a colony of ants for an hour (autism is a blessing in disguise, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise). I still enjoy going to the forest, but I now realize that my time on this Earth is scarce and fleeting.</p>
<p>With two months of investing, I have now earned as much money as I do in half a year of work, if you take taxes into consideration. In contrast to my day job, I genuinely consider investing fun. Essentially, I earned 17,000 euro doing something that I enjoy doing. One of the fun parts about it is that you can laugh at the normies. Some numale coworker said mean things to me because I upset him by explaining why the batsoupflu is no big deal? Say mean things to my 17,000 euro.</p>
<p>The part that I like most about it is being right when most people are wrong. If you wonder why I wrote essay after essay about the batsoupflu, now you know. For the past few months, understanding this virus was basically part of my job. I already sold some of my stock, because they’ve shot up so rapidly that I can no longer consider them undervalued. If you’re interested, I’ll explain some of my ideas on investing in my next post. If you’re not interested, I’ll probably still do it.</p>
<h2>Why have people lost their minds?</h2>
<p>I think it’s important to help you understand how this mass outbreak of hysteria could take place. Remember, we are in a situation of mass hysteria. Just because it seems that almost everyone considers what’s happening now normal does not somehow make it normal. Back after 9/11, Bush had a 90% approval rating. In Austria, 99% of people once voted to be annexed by Nazi Germany. In Egypt, around 90% of people support the death penalty for people who leave Islam. An idea or a mentality can be extremely popular, yet nonetheless extremely stupid.</p>
<p>What has taken place in the past few months, is extremely traumatic for normal prosocial people.&nbsp;People behave as if they have lost their minds, because they have gone through a collective trauma in the past few months. Unlike weirdo’s like you and me, normal prosocial people have a deep faith in the institutions that govern their society, as well as a deep fear of death that they normally have to suppress.</p>
<p>For most people, March 2020 was an absolute unimaginable nightmare. People were afraid to leave their homes. They were locked inside their houses and told that their only valid excuse to leave their house was to visit the supermarket. They saw their prime minister on TV, addressing the whole nation, telling people that a new deadly virus had spread across the country, a virus that would kill one out of every thirty people it infects.</p>
<p>This virus was not going away without a vaccine, it was going to flood the intensive care with patients. We had to stay inside, to make sure the intensive care would not be overcrowded. Those of us who are not part of the 3.4% of infected people who die, would spend weeks in the hospital, stuck on a mechanical ventilator. Our lungs would be damaged for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>Remember, that’s what you were told. You’re already trying to rewrite the narrative in your head, because what you were genuinely told by the media is so extremely traumatic that you can’t properly deal with it. You have basically functioned in survival mode for weeks. You were essentially told that something had spread out of Southern China, that would wipe humanity out like a bad case of fleas. The Catholic Pope and European politicians were speculating that this must be nature’s vengeance against humanity. The media was showing you pictures of corpses laying in the streets of Italy.</p>
<p>People remember this, but they’re trying to suppress it. You’re now trying to write a narrative in your head, that you were always told that this was just going to be a heavier than usual flu season. You’re trying to make what happened to you fit in your head. You’re trying to convince yourself that what happened makes sense.</p>
<p>But the reality is of course that it doesn’t make sense. It didn’t make any sense from the start. The experts you place trust in, have completely failed you. For modern progressives, this has been a hugely traumatic experience. Conservatives have a history of being skeptical towards experts. They don’t believe experts when experts warn them about climate change, when experts tell them that we evolved from an ape-like animal, or when experts tell them that vaccines are safe.</p>
<p>In addition to this, conservatives are able to put the issue of death into perspective. Some of them are veterans, they have lived through experiences where their lives were at risk. Most conservatives are religious, they have faith that although they will eventually die, their deaths make sense in the bigger picture. Conservatives respond to what has happened with anger at the media and at their politicians.</p>
<p>For progressive people, there is no proper response to this. Remember, young people signed up for huge college debts, with the idea in the back of their heads that scientists can deliver us some sort of objective truth about the world we inhabit. Imagine spending 90,000 dollar to learn about epidemiology in college, only to discover that epidemiologists have caused the implosion of the global economy, by being wrong about a virus.</p>
<p>The political establishment that embraced these lockdowns, is almost without exception progressive. They had to struggle against people like Trump, who were downplaying the virus. And now we face a situation, where the average Joe with common sense was right, whereas the experts got it wrong. If you want to understand the virus, you were better off listening to your racist Uncle Bob who dropped out of high school or <a href="https://www.rintrah.nl/coronadoom/">some anonymous Dutch dude with a blog</a>, than you were listening to Blue Checks on Twitter with Phd’s in epidemiology.</p>
<p>The reality remains, that the expert class has completely failed us. The media failed to properly report on this virus and ask critical questions. The World Health Organization failed to report on the numerous mild cases that don’t lead to any significant symptoms. The politicians failed to help us put the virus into a proper perspective. What did the expert class do? They terrorized you, over what we can now recognize as a glorified cold virus.</p>
<p>Progressives are aware of this at a subconscious level. They realize that the actual events do not fit the narrative that we were warned about. We were told that this was going to be an existential threat to civilization. It turned out to be no such thing.</p>
<p>“Science” has replaced the role of religion for modern progressive people. The scientists are infallible and virtuous, they are capable of giving us insight into the human condition. What took place here would have the potential to shatter that faith in “science”, because scientists as a community have failed. When Africa faces hunger of biblical proportions and the American economy implodes by 50% over a glorified cold virus, you can say that scientists have failed us.</p>
<p>It doesn’t shatter the faith however, because most human beings are fundamentally not rational. Rather, our brain protects us against the logical outgrowths of reason, through a psychological immune system.&nbsp;Normal human beings have all sorts of psychological mechanisms built into their brain that prevent them from seeing the world as it really is. That prevents them from embracing ideas that would make them depressed or unpopular among their peers, both of which historically generally wiped your genes from the gene pool.</p>
<p>People are unable to psychologically cope with the realization that the entire scientific-political-media-academic establishment imposed extreme existential terror on us back in March, for no good valid reason. Because they are unable to cope with it, they just don’t accept the reality.</p>
<p>They convince themselves that although they were morbidly afraid to visit the supermarket in March and hated those who dared to go outside for trivial reasons, they are now able to gather in large crowds to protest because they happen to wear a mask. They completely forget about the experts who warned them that we would see a huge spike in deaths, two weeks after people gathered in a crowd somewhere. They try to reconcile the irreconcilable.</p>
<p>What has happened to people causes extreme cognitive dissonance. They now need some alternative outlet for their pent up rage and frustration. They have decided to embrace the most politically correct and culturally sanctioned outlet they could think of.</p>
<p>Remember, these are people whose religion has failed them. Science for them has filled the void that used to be filled by religion. What people tend to do when their religion has failed them is to blame themselves, for not being virtuous enough.</p>
<p>As a consequence, we see the current outbreak of mass hysteria. On average, British police kill two people in a year. Why do we see riots and statues being demolished in Britain? Because …</p></div></article></div>

					<div id="droparea"><p>I told GPT-3 I would be presenting at a Hacker News meetup in Japan, and asked it to generate a presentation for me. Here's what it came up with, read by yours truly.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vZalOEmdHFo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>There's also a tweet-sized version <a href="https://twitter.com/bemmu/status/1285284131656445952">here</a>, and the slides are also on SlideShare <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/bemmu/this-presentation-was-generated-by-gpt3">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI API</a> to generate one slide and one image caption at a time, asking GPT-3 about three times for each and picking the best output. When it generated image caption, I would go online to find a matching image, or if none was available I'd try to splice up an image using <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a> and <a href="https://www.remove.bg/">Remove.bg</a>.</p>
<p>My starting prompt was:</p>
<pre><code>A presentation was given at the Hacker News event in Kansai. 
The title of the presentation was
</code></pre>
<p>When it generated bullet points, I let it generate several and then picked the best 5 out of what it came up with. Once it generated a slide, I edited that into the prompt as well so it could continue generating more slides for the same presentation, and re-ran it to generate the next slide. </p>
<p>Piecewise concatenated output from OpenAI:</p>
<pre><code>"Strategies for Learning to Code in Japan" and the subtitle was 
"Fairly easily and rather effortlessly achieve practical software 
development skills."

The first presentation slide had a picture of a man playing a violin 
in front of a wall of violins, and the title of the slide was "Violin 
skills are of almost no value". Text under the slide said: "a metaphor 
for how useful programming ability can be for starters".

The next slide suggested a number of strategies for how to best use 
ones time to achieve productivity quickly:

1. Nobody figures out how to code perfectly their first time.
2. It's mostly luck.
3. Learn just the right skills, in the right order.
4. Avoid perfectionism.
5. Not doing something is sometimes the best way to learn something.

The next slide had a picture of a monkey drawn in crayon, and
and the words "All problems are pretty much the same." written 
under the monkey drawing. The text of that slide was:
"Not only are all software development problems more or less 
the same, but the best way to solve them is usually so simple, 
that a monkey could do it."

The next slide had a picture of a monkey, a sand hourglass, 
and a spoon and the words "Let's get started then!" written 
under it.

The text of that slide was: "Just like a monkey makes sand castles 
with an hourglass, all our time is of limited duration, so let's get 
started to code a product for clients. Software development is 
actually a bunch of often complicated problems. But that's not a big 
deal, is it!?" and the color of the text was red.

The next slide had a picture of a happy architect with a blueprint 
in one hand and blue pencil in the other hand, standing in front of a 
huge complex, and the words "Looking smart is the social norm".

The text of that slide was:
"Almost all developers feel the pressure (for whatever reason) to have the
look of the competent coder, most likely due to peer pressure. So it might
be counter-productive to cut corners during the development phase." and
the color of the text was purple.

The next slide had a sign: "DANGER do not enter" and this text under it: 
"If you don't need your code to run during actual product development, 
stuff it in a module in a separate directory." The color of the text 
was orange.

The next slide just had the text: Richard Feynman was reported to have 
said: "What I cannot create, I do not understand," something that has 
been paraphrased in the programming world as "If you don't regularly turn 
code into poetry, you probably aren't a good programmer."

The next slide had a picture of a happy runner and this sentence next 
to it: "If you've written 500 lines of code and have an actual working 
program that doesn't crash, sprint to the finish line." 
and the color of text was green.

The next slide had a picture of a swordsman catching a bullet and 
this text: "A happy ending to all of our code." and the color of 
text was yellow. The text of the slide was: "So you built a program
and it worked in like 10 minutes. All your code was beautiful." 
and the color of text was blue.

The final slide had the title of the presentation: "Why you should 
always code like it's your last day on Earth". Next to it was a picture 
of a person with their whole life ahead of them staring into a terminal, 
a ball and chain attached to each leg, and a long nose and a beard. The 
text of the slide was:
"If you always think like it's the last day on Earth (your last day coding), 
it'll push you just enough to get you to finish whatever you might need 
to finish."

The last remark at the last slide of the presentation was:
"So now that you know it's impossible to not 
learn to code, go write something, anything.
So stop writing nuclear missile designs, or the best 
ad blocker ever, and just get started on whatever.

The next slide had the text "And then when you finally do finish this nice 
feature, you should always make sure you drink the required amount of alcohol." 
with a background image of whiskey bottles. The decorative text on that slide 
was: "But don't drink too much alcohol and end up like me."

And the concluding remark of the presentation:
"So basically just go ahead before you wake up in a cold sweat from a scary 
dream about the future, coding-less, uh, eating those annoying squares of tofu."
The background image of that slide was a plate of tofu next to a glass of beer
and the font color was orange to emphasize the suggestion to drink.

Scientists discovered a compound in the leaves of a common shrub, the American beautyberry, that boosts an antibiotic’s activity against antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria. Laboratory experiments showed that the plant compound works in combination with oxacillin to knock down the resistance to the drug of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, or MRSA.

And a prior study by Quave and colleagues found that extracts from the leaves inhibit growth of the bacterium that causes acne. For this study, the researchers focused on testing extracts collected from the leaves for efficacy against MRSA.</p><figure data-orig-width="611" data-orig-height="384"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5347126a80ec29f07571d42bf91af8b1/537fc9242f7b19c2-23/s640x960/0d0bba3a9dbb6aed4e1a9f7fd17b09b6c43a0913.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="611" data-orig-height="384" width="611" height="384"></figure><p><i>Image: The American beautyberry was an important medicinal plant for some Native American tribes.

The compound belongs to a group of chemicals known as clerodane diterpenoids, some of which are used by plants to repel predators.<br></p><p>Since the compound only modestly inhibited MRSA, the researchers tried it in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics.<br></p><p>“Beta-lactam antibiotics are some of the safest and least toxic that are currently available in the antibiotic arsenal,” Quave says. “Unfortunately, MRSA has developed resistance to them.” <br></p><p>Laboratory tests showed that the beautyberry leaf compound synergizes with the beta-lactam antibiotic oxacillin to knock down MRSA’s resistance to the drug.<br></p><p>The next step is to test the combination of the beautyberry leaf extract and oxacillin as a therapy in animal models. If those results prove effective against MRSA infections, the researchers will synthesize the plant compound in the lab and tweak its chemical structure to try to further enhance its efficacy as a combination therapy with oxacillin.<br></p><p>“We need to keep filling the drug-discovery pipeline with innovative solutions, including potential combination therapies, to address the ongoing and growing problem of antibiotic resistance,” Quave says.<br></p><p>Each year in the U.S., at least 2.8 million people get an antibiotic-resistant infection and more than 35,000 people die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br></p><p>“Even in the midst of the COVID-19, we can’t forget about the issue of antibiotic resistance,” Quave says. She notes that many COVID-19 patients are receiving antibiotics to deal with secondary infections brought on by their weakened conditions, raising concerns about a later surge in antibiotic-resistant infections.<br></p><p>Co-authors of the study include Emory post-doctoral fellow Gina Porras; Emory graduate students Caitlin Risener and Lewis Marquez; Tharanga Samarakoon, collections manager of the Emory Herbarium; and Roberta Melander from the University of Notre Dame.<br></p><p>The work was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the Jones Ecological Research Center and Emory University.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.emory.edu%2Fstories%2F2020%2F07%2Fesc_beautyberry_leaf_extract%2Fcampus.html&amp;t=NTU2ZTdmNzY4M2RjMmE0ZTY4MzIwYTJmMDFiN2M4ZmY5NGQ2ZGZlYixWRVl0d284Vg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F624186930132811776%2Fbeautyberry-superbug-study&amp;m=0">Emory Health Sciences</a></b></p><p><b>Full Study:</b>&nbsp;

<p><strong>Edit 07.20.20:</strong><br>This post was #1 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Hacker News</a> today, which did 2 things: First, it crashed this site (sorry, won’t happen again). Second, it catalyzed some great dialogue <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23900783">here</a>. If you’d like to continue the conversation, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexDReeve">Twitter</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>A few years ago, I read&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2C4RbBY">Principles</a>&nbsp;by Ray Dalio, and I became enamored with the concept of codifying my own. So, I borrowed the idea and started noting them down.</p>



<p>This list—pieced together over the past few years—reflects what I believe are some of the most important principles for product managers. I can’t claim credit for inventing these; they are the summation of what I’ve learned through experience, coaching, and osmosis. This list wouldn’t exist if not for the incredible people I’m fortunate to work with and from whom I’ve learned so much.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Product Management is a broad function, so I’ve tried to distill this down to the top 3-4 across 6 categories:</strong>&nbsp;</strong>These principles are very much a “living” list. I don’t intend for this list to be exhaustive—nor does it reflect the entire scope of the product manager role—and these principles will continue to develop over time.</p>



<h3>Leading Your Team</h3>



<p><strong><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Your team should be able to repeat the vision, goal, and value</strong>. </strong>If your team can’t, you probably haven’t communicated it enough or aren’t aligned.</p>



<p><strong>2. You should know what game you’re playing, and how you keep score</strong>. Credit to Adam Nash for this framing, see here for his <a href="https://adamnash.blog/2011/12/16/be-a-great-product-leader/">fantastic article</a>.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The game you’re playing:</strong> Your vision for the product, your product’s value to the customer, your competitive advantage, and how you’ll win.</li><li><strong>How you’ll keep score</strong>: What does winning mean? How will you measure success? What’s your “compass” to tell whether you’re traveling in the right direction?</li></ul>



<p><strong><strong>3. Your team should know the path to reach the goal.&nbsp;</strong></strong>You need not detail execution to the point of false precision, but you and your team must understand the high-level milestones. If the milestones aren’t clear because of unknows, these unknowns should be explicit.</p>



<h3>Making Decisions</h3>



<p><strong>4. Decisions should be documented, explained, and widely communicated</strong>. It should&nbsp;<em>feel&nbsp;</em>like over-communication. If you don’t feel like you’re over-communicating, you probably aren’t communicating enough.</p>



<p><strong>5. Decisions, and what you prioritize, need evidence.&nbsp;</strong>It’s your job to make sure this evidence exists. Inevitably, you will base some decisions on your judgment in place of data. Judgment-weighted decisions are okay, provided it’s explicitly communicated.</p>



<p><strong>6. Stakeholders should be involved early and often, and alignment should be explicit.&nbsp;</strong>You’re looking for either a “yes, I agree with this decision, or a “no, I disagree, but I can commit to moving forward.” Escalate quickly and cleanly to resolve misalignments.</p>



<h3>Communication Effectively</h3>



<p><strong>7. There is no such thing as over-communication.</strong> “Fluff” communication = enough communication.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re not sick of saying it, you probably aren’t saying it enough. Constant communication might feel like “fluff,” but it isn’t. Evangelism is a critical part of the role—and it’s your job to make sure the organization is aligned and swimming in the same direction.</li><li>Marty Cagan, in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eMLBS0">Inspired</a>, said it best: <em>Evangelize continuously and relentlessly. There is no such thing as over‐communicating when it comes to explaining and selling the vision. Especially in larger organizations, there is simply no escaping the need for near‐constant evangelization. You’ll find that people in all corners of the company will at random times get nervous or scared about something they see or hear. Quickly reassure them before their fear infects others.</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>8. You, the product manager, should have a uniquely high communication bar.  </strong>Most functions have a primary “output” that isn’t communication: Designers design, engineers code, etc. For you, communication&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a primary “output,” and it should be exceptional.</p>



<p><strong>9. You have to own the narrative.&nbsp;</strong>When there’s a narrative vacuum, people will “creatively” fill in the blanks themselves—and you might not like it. Losing control of the narrative can be incredibly disruptive to your team’s ability to deliver.</p>



<h3>Being an Effective Operator</h3>



<p><strong><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Strong relationships enable strong collaboration.&nbsp;</strong></strong>“Have strong relationships” sounds obvious, but the importance of relationships “up,” “down,” and “across” can’t be overstated. Without a solid mix of relationships and credibility, you won’t succeed.</p>



<p><strong><strong>11. Don’t be in the weeds managing every nuance of every project; save this for emergencies</strong>. </strong>Swim in your lane, and give your team space to do their job(s). Focus on:</p>



<ul><li>Setting the goal, i.e., “what game are we playing?” and lead/help the team in figuring out how to get there (milestones, dependencies, alignment, etc.).</li><li>Leading the team. E.g., establish the communication cadence (updates, Slack channels, syncs), meeting rhythm, high-level project milestones, success metrics.</li><li>Don’t pester. Establish the right communication channels upfront, and let your team keep you updated. See “maker’s schedule” under (12).</li></ul>



<p><strong><strong>12. Greatness is achieved in the agency of others</strong></strong>. Product managers follow the “manager’s<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">&nbsp;schedule</a>.”<strong> </strong>Engineers &amp; designers follow the “maker’s schedule.” Help your team be great “makers”—keep them unblocked; respond effectively to unfolding situations.</p>



<p><strong>13. Your job is to create clarity</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is some sound advice that I got early on (thank you, Greg!). As a product manager, constantly think about how you can <em>create clarity</em> for your team: Clearer product requirements, resolving edge cases, answering questions, etc.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re drowning in questions, you probably aren’t proactively communicating effectively, or the product requirements lack clarity. Some questions are natural, so use your judgment.</li></ul>



<p><strong>14. Be on top of your shit.</strong> Until I figure out how to better articulate this, I’ll say it ineloquently as “just be on it.” Know your business, your product, your team, be responsive, communicate relentlessly, make good decisions, own your results, get 1% better every day.</p>



<h3>Managing Your Time</h3>



<p><strong>15. 80% of your role is discovering the right product &amp; driving organizational alignment, and 20% is answering clarifying questions for the “makers” on your team. </strong>Product teams are in a constant cycle of discovery and delivery, which run in parallel: </p>



<ul><li>In an ideal world, engineers are ~80% delivery, ~20% discovery; product managers are ~80% discovery, 20% delivery.</li><li>In large complex organizations, this is a difficult target to achieve, but strive to spend 80% of your time on discovering the right product (ideation, validation, testing, etc.) and communication (driving organizational alignment, creating clarity).</li><li>“Organizational alignment” is an intentionally broad term, including everything from 1-1 meetings to executive strategy reviews to product “deep dives” to all-hands presentations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>16. Ensuring that you have time set aside for strategy and “focus” work is your responsibility. </strong>Getting sidetracked with 1,000 emails and Slack messages is natural, but it can’t be an excuse. Make sure you have time set aside for focused work.</p>



<h3>Running Effective Meetings</h3>



<p><strong>17. Send agenda items beforehand. At the start of the meeting, collect input,</strong> <strong>and align on the goal. </strong>Meetings are expensive; when people are meeting, they often aren’t making. Own the meetings you run, and make sure they’re productive.</p>



<p><strong>18. Use “DAD” to help structure and run meetings</strong>. Most meetings are a mix of Discussion, Actions, and Decisions: Document any decisions, communicate topics of discussion and enumerate any action items.</p>



<p><strong>19. “ABFU,” or Always Be Following Up (terrible, I know).</strong> Make sure you (or someone else) sends notes to all relevant stakeholders within ~24 hours. They don’t need to be perfect, but make sure they exist and that you communicate them.</p>



<p><strong>20. Be deeply curious, and ask the “dumb” questions.</strong> Asking the right questions, even if they seem dumb, is a catalyst for creating clarity. Ask questions openly, in earnest, and let everyone else hear the answer. You probably weren’t the only one with that question.</p>



<h3>Running Projects &amp; Other</h3>



<p><strong><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Every project includes a mix of Discovery, Design, and Delivery (and iteration); you should make sure these run in sequence.&nbsp;</strong></strong>While we expect and&nbsp;<em>desire</em>&nbsp;some overlap, aspire not to make sweeping changes to design during delivery (as an example).</p>



<p><strong>22. Be responsive; if you’re not, you might be holding things up. </strong>As the hub between every other function, and often the decision-maker, you have to keep the wheels greased for your team. One idea: ~2 hours for Slack, ~2 days for email (but much faster for anything urgent).  </p>

They don’t have uniform shapes or sizes and are subject to changes very frequently. Even the zones or clusters drawn by the operations teams’ local knowledge require updating and have arbitrary edges.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/discrete_continuous_data.png"><figcaption>Source: LearnGIS.org</figcaption></figure><p>Making sense of your spatial data and deriving precise insights requires these analyses to become more granular and uniform.</p><p><strong><strong>Grid system</strong></strong> brings that fine granularity to the table. It works brilliantly in bucketing all your lat-longs into “cells”. These cells can also be clustered to represent a particular neighborhood or area and can be aggregated at different levels.</p><p>Hence, this system becomes critical to crunch large spatial data sets to match the supply &amp; demand fragmented across the city.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/0_UBG0oU5o1FRbVm8l.png"><figcaption>Source: Uber</figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-is-meant-by-grids">What is meant by grids?</h2><p>In Spatial Data Science, we use grids that are regular polygons repeating over a surface, edge to edge to cover any space without overlaps and gaps — a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/tessellation.html" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong><strong>tessellation</strong></strong></a><strong><strong>.</strong></strong> Each cell can be assigned a unique id for spatial indexing (aggregating the points inside that cell).</p><p>A wide variety of grids of different shapes have been proposed including squares, rectangles, triangles, hexagons or diamonds. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_global_grid" rel="noopener nofollow">global grid system</a> covers the entire surface of the earth.</p><p>If you are a hyperlocal, on-demand company, grids as small as<strong><strong> </strong>0.5 <strong>sq. km </strong></strong>can be very useful to run models that work in context to location and in <strong><strong>real-time. </strong></strong><a href="https://medium.com/@localeai/how-analyzing-supply-demand-gaps-can-optimize-your-unit-economics-1da3ecd340c6" rel="noopener">Examples</a> include surge pricing in high demand areas, promotions in low demand areas &amp; distribution models of delivery folks on the ground.</p><hr><h2 id="what-are-the-different-grid-types">What are the different grid types?</h2><p>There are just three types of grids or that can tessellate: squares, equilateral triangles &amp; hexagons.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/0_GBiKhBHv_cmkbQhn.png"><figcaption>Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><h3 id="1-square-grids-">1. Square grids:</h3><p>The most common application of square grids occurs in raster datasets and geohashes. For the scope of this piece, we will focus on geohashes.</p><p><a href="https://www.factual.com/blog/how-geohashes-work/" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong><strong>Geohash</strong></strong></a> is a hierarchical data structure to transform a 2D spatial point (lat &amp; long) into a short string of alphabets and numbers. They divide the world into a grid of 32 cells with 4 rows and 8 columns.</p><p>You can keep splitting up each cell into a grid of 32 cells. Thus, the longer the string of the geohash, the higher the accuracy! You can also easily identify if geohashes are close together if they can have a common prefix. So, the longer the common prefix, the closer they are.</p><p>For example, the coordinate pair<em><em> (57.64911, 10.40744) </em></em>near the tip of the peninsula of Jutland, Denmark produces a slightly shorter hash of <em><em>u4pruydqqvj. [1]</em></em></p><h3 id="2-triangular-grids-">2. Triangular grids:</h3><p>Triangular grids are not very commonly used. Besides, their unfamiliarity, one of the reasons for that is they have a large perimeter and a small area which means it’s harder to piece them together on the map.</p><p>Another reason is that each triangle is connected to only three adjacent triangles, which limits the number of options to move and to make connections. (Check the image below)</p><p>Moreover, while for hexagons and squares, there are always two faces parallel to each other, for triangles, there are two directions in which lines are parallel centered from the axis of movement. Thus, in a way, there are not completely symmetrical. <em><em>[2]</em></em></p><h3 id="3-hexagonal-grids-">3. Hexagonal grids:</h3><p>Besides looking appealing, hexagons are more symmetric than geohashes. They are very close to circles in terms of shape to provide a more accurate sampling. <em><em>[3]</em></em></p><p>As a result, this system has been increasingly adopted by companies like Uber.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/45.PNG"></figure><p><strong><strong>Fun fact:</strong></strong> A hex grid and triangular grids are a dual of each other — putting a dot in the center of each hexagon &amp; connecting them to all the adjacent ones, you get a triangular grid and vice versa! <em><em>[4]</em></em></p><p>Moving on the vertices of a hexagonal grid is equivalent to playing in the spaces on a triangular grid. Square grids, on the other hand, are a dual of themselves.</p><hr><h2 id="why-hexagons">Why hexagons?</h2><p>At <a href="http://locale.ai/" rel="noopener nofollow">Locale</a>, one question that we get a lot from our customers is, “why are we using hexbins and not geohashes?”</p><p>Well, the choice depends on your exact use case and you would have to make some tradeoffs, no matter what you use. So, let’s take some parameters and deep dive.</p><h3 id="distance-from-nearest-cells-">Distance from Nearest Cells:</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/0_IxCpGcjXk4en4BJO.png"><figcaption>Source: Uber</figcaption></figure><p>This diagram shows the distance of the center of triangles, square &amp; hexagon to its neighbors.</p><p>A triangle has three kinds of distance (through the edge, vertex and across the center of the edge), a square has two (across the edge &amp; the diagonal) and hexagon only has one — another reason why triangles are not really favored.</p><p>This property of hexagons makes it very easy to perform analysis and is preferred when your analysis includes aspects of<strong><strong> connectivity or movement.</strong></strong> <em><em>[4]</em></em></p><p>All the neighbors in a hexagon form a ring around it with equal radius. The <a href="https://uber.github.io/h3/#/documentation/api-reference/neighbors" rel="noopener nofollow">kRing</a> function provides grid cells within distance “k” of an origin index. In the diagram below, here is the <strong><strong>1st kRing</strong></strong> of the shaded hexagon and square.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/98.PNG"></figure><h3 id="fitting-on-curved-surfaces-">Fitting on Curved Surfaces:</h3><p>Hexagons are the densest way to pack circles in tessellation and reduce<strong><strong> edge effects</strong></strong>. (Circles have the least perimeter to area ratio but can’t form a continuous grid).</p><p>The more similar a polygon is to a circle, the closer the points near the border area are to the center. Thus, any point inside a hexagon is closer to its center as compared to an equal-area square or triangle.</p><p>Now, when large areas come into play and the curvature of the earth is important to consider, hexagons are therefore better suited to fit the curvature and suffer less distortion.<em><em> [5]</em></em></p><h3 id="explicit-patterns-in-data-">Explicit Patterns in Data:</h3><p>Hexagons allow any <strong><strong>curvature of the patterns </strong></strong>in the data to show easily and explicitly because they break up lines.</p><p>For linear figures like squares and rectangles, this becomes tricky. These shapes draw our attention to the straight, unbroken and parallel lines which hinder the patterns present in the data. Refer to the diagram below. <em><em>[6]</em></em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/hj.PNG"></figure><hr><h2 id="why-geohashes">Why geohashes?</h2><p>That brings me to my next question, <strong><strong>“When would someone use fishnets or square grids?”</strong></strong></p><h3 id="aggregation-division-of-cells-">Aggregation/ Division of Cells:</h3><p>Different kinds of models require different granularity and that’s where aggregation and division become important.</p><p>If you need to increase the spatial resolution of a square grid, you just need to divide it into 4. Similarly, to aggregate, you need to combine four grids into one.</p><p>For hexagons, aggregations and divisions are not uniform at different scales as shown in the image below. The finer cells are only approximately contained in the parent cell. <em><em>[7]</em></em></p><p>Squares are preferred over hexagons for hierarchical analysis. Combining square grids is fairly simple. No spatial operations are necessary for combing multiple grids built on the same template — you can use matrix algebra.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.locale.ai/content/images/2020/01/0_-YQ8-fE2LcJZuAdi.png"><figcaption>Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><h3 id="very-intuitive-familiar-">Very Intuitive &amp; Familiar:</h3><p>We also think in terms of “<strong><strong>squares</strong></strong>”. Up, down, left, right are simple to understand. We have built cities and civilizations on squares and rectangles.

For example, honeycombs, graphite, benzene, silicene etc. Chinese Checkers is played on a hex grid and several variants of chess have also been invented for a hex board.</p><p>The hex grid is a distinguishing feature of the games from many wargame publishers, and a few other games (such as The Settlers of Catan)! <em><em>[8]</em></em></p><hr><p><em>If you resonate with this problem and want to contribute, we are <a href="http://locale.freshteam.com/jobs" rel="noopener nofollow">hiring</a> for different roles.

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Background: <a href="https://ebbflow.io/">Ebbflow</a> is a multi-cloud load balancer that provisions browser-trusted certificates for your endpoints in addition to providing a client-friendly SSH proxy. Servers can host endpoints from any cloud, on premises, or from your home, all at the same time. It uses nearest-server routing for low latencies and is deployed around the globe.</p>
        <p>This post describes how Ebbflow vends its <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow">client</a> to Windows users which is written in Rust, describing the tools used to build and ultimately deliver the program to users.</p>
        <h3>Ebbflow Client 101</h3>
         <p>Ebbflow's job is to route user traffic to your web server application (or SSH Daemon) on your servers. The central Ebbflow service proxies data between user connections (e.g. browser, SSH client) and the client. The client then proxies the data to your web server or local SSH daemon. Users of Ebbflow install the client on machines that will host endpoints, be SSH-ed to, or both at the same time (which is very useful). The following diagram shows this visually.</p>
        <p><img id="clientdg" src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/clientdiagram.png"></p><p><small><i>Quick note: The client initiates the connection to the central Ebbflow service via an outbound TLS connection, which makes the client extremely firewall friendly. You may completely block all inbound connections but still host websites or be SSH-ed to! Also, this innovation allows the servers to be located in any network, and even change networks without any configuration at all. Ebbflow just receives connections from the general internet, and after authentication and authorization, will allow the server to host the endpoint or be SSH-ed to. Neat!</i></small></p>
        <p>The client has two parts, the CLI and the background daemon. Both of these programs are 100% Rust, 100% <code>async</code>, and 100% 'safe', <i>and</i> statically linked - the dream of any Rust developer! The <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflow.rs">CLI</a> is an executable tool named <code>ebbflow</code> that is used to tell the background to host new endpoints, disable or re-enable endpoints or the SSH proxy, and configure other settings.</p>
        <p>The background daemon is the second piece to this puzzle, and is the workhorse and is responsible for actually transferring bytes between the central Ebbflow servers and your local web server or SSH daemon. This daemon is just a long-running background executable named <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflowd.rs"><code>ebbflowd</code></a>.</p>
        <h2>Windows</h2>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/windows.png"></p><p>Supporting Windows as a first-class server OS is very important to Ebbflow. Taking the two executables &amp; re-compiling them on Windows was simple thanks to Rust's abstractions over the underlying OS and numerous community projects. First things first, the background daemon needs to be changed to work in a Windows world.</p>
        <h3>Background Daemon / Windows Service</h3>
        <p>The <code>ebbflow</code> CLI is very simple and is portable in the sense that you could execute the binary on a windows machine without installing it and it will do its job correctly, but <code>ebbflowd</code> is another story. To execute a background program in Windows one uses the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications">Windows Service</a> framework. This framework is needed as the <code>ebbflowd</code> program needs to run when there are no interactive users, start when the system starts, and be watched and restarted in the event of a crash (which has not happened due to Rust's inherit safety and never <code>unwrap</code>ing).</p>
        <p>A sticking point of using the Windows Service framework is that your program needs to implement a specific <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/service-programs">interface</a>, namely it must provide an entry point, handle signals, and register itself. To help, the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/windows-service"><code>windows-service</code></a> Rust crate (provided by <a href="https://github.com/faern">Linus Färnstrand</a>) makes this very simple.</p>
        <p>This <code>windows-service</code> crate provides a macro which requires that you implement just a few functions that are effectively <code>main</code> functions. The Ebbflow client uses <code>#[cfg(windows)]</code> to conditionally include all of the <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflowd.rs#L25-L142">necessary code</a> to implement these functions and therefore the Windows Service interface itself! The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/winlog">winlog</a> crate was also helpful for taking <a href="https://crates.io/crates/log">log events</a> and adding them to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wes/windows-event-log">Windows Event Log</a> system.</p>
        <h3>Going Static</h3>
        <p>Rust will dynamically link against the OS's <code>libc</code> implementation when the standard library is used, which is the case for almost all substantial Rust applications. On Windows, this means Rust will compile programs and link them to the system's 'MSVC' (MicroSoft Visual C++) libc implementation. Interestingly, the default Windows 10 image does NOT include this library! This results in Rust code breaking when executed on a new system, something that has come up in testing, but may not come up in development as MSVC would likely get installed at one point or another when setting up a Windows machine for code development.</p>
        <p>Statically linking Rust code is simple. To bring along MSVC with your compiled Rust program, you <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1721-crt-static.md">instruct</a> the compiler to statically link MSVC. In my case I <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml#L89-L90">set just one environment variable</a> (<code>RUSTFLAGS='-C target-feature=+crt-static'</code>) and it simply worked, but you can add a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44387312">config file entry or pass a flag</a> to compilation as well.</p>
        <p>Besides the <code>std</code> library, Rust code may link to other OS libraries most often OpenSSL or libsodium for crypto. The Ebbflow client avoids this by using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustls"><code>rustls</code></a> which uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ring">ring</a> under the hood. Rustls is an ergonomic TLS library for Rust. It is <a href="https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html">highly performant</a> even compared to OpenSSL and recently underwent a 3rd party <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf">security audit</a> which showed no flaws. When you invest in the Rust ecosystem and use Rust-written libraries, you are rewarded with the ability to statically link which is a desireable situation.</p>
        <h3>Building the <code>.msi</code> using Wix</h3>
        <p>Windows uses 'installers' in the form of <code>.msi</code> packages to handle which packages are installed on a system. These installers tell Windows what files/executables go where and contain logic to handle upgrades, uninstallations, and configuration management.</p>
        <p>Ebbflow uses Wix which is a tool that takes an <code>.xml</code> configuration file and generates <code>.msi</code> packages. Conveniently, a plug-in to Rust's <code>cargo</code> build tool named <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-wix"><code>cargo-wix</code></a> exists. This tool can generate a skeleton Wix <code>xml</code> file which we then modified to suit our needs. Under the hood, executing <code>cargo wix</code> will compile your program in <code>--release</code>, then package up everything into your <code>.msi</code> using <a href="https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/overview/candle.html">candle.exe</a> to compile your Wix config and <a href="https://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/overview/light.html">light.exe</a> to link it.</p>
        <p>Generating and tinkering with the <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/wix/main.wxs">client's Wix file</a> took some time. There are numerous StackOverflow q/a's and other resources to help with writing the Wix file which was helpful, but I found that vending a Windows Service in an installer is more of an edge case. Also, configuring the UI components of the installer is tricky and I never found a great reference implementation or other documentation.</p>
        <h3>Automated Builds using GitHub Actions</h3>
        <p>Up to this point, I've produced a statically linked Windows program and packaged it into an installer. For various reasons such as build reproducability &amp; transparency, and hosting the built <code>.msi</code> for free, Ebbflow uses <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> to build and package up the client. You can see the client's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml#L86-L106">Windows build configuration on GitHub</a>, and here is a snippet:</p>
        
        <p>GitHub provides a Windows image that has <a href="https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/master/images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md">various build tools included</a>, importantly Wix. Getting Windows builds set up on GitHub Actions was pretty simple and I had a great experience with the service. </p>
        <h3>Distribution to Users</h3>
        <p>After writing the code, making an installer and testing that out, the next step is to figure out how to get this into our customers hands. To solve this, the first thought is to just distribute the <code>.msi</code> file itself and notify customers of upgrades. This generally works and the installer can handle upgrades and uninstallations. However, there are drawbacks. The major one is that any future updates will require the customer to download the new <code>.msi</code>, which requires some custom process. Windows will flag any software that is unsigned and all applications must be signed using certificates derived from trusted certificate authorities. This is fine and secure but to have our <code>.msi</code> work without warnings you must purchase a code signing certificate/key from someone like Digicert or the like which can easily run into the hundreds of dollars. Alternatively you can create your own CA &amp; signing key/certificate, self-sign the <code>msi</code>, then have all customers add your CA to their trusted store. This does not seem too common from my understanding.</p>
        <p>These two drawbacks are pretty severe, which is what leads us to our chosen solutions, Chocolatey and Winget.</p>
        <h4>Chocolatey</h4>
      <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/choco.svg"></p><p><a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> is a 3rd party package manager and you can use it to install, update, remove, and/or search for packages. It works great for personal use and will feel very familiar to any Linux users. Chocolatey also provides a multi-computer management solution to enterprise customers so sysadmins could distribute and maintain many Windows computers from afar.</p>
        <p>Importantly, Chocolatey packages do not require code-signing and will not trigger any warnings when installed. Adding package to the Chocolatey package store is <a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/CreatePackagesQuickStart#prerequisites">decently simple</a>. Chocolatey deals in <code>.nupkg</code>-es, which are easily created with the Chocolatey CLI. Execute <code>choco new</code> to generate a base set of files. After modifying them, you package up everything into the <code>.nupkg</code> container using <code>choco pack</code>. Ebbflow's chocolatey repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/chocolatey-ebbflow">on GitHub</a>. Be sure to remove configuration entries or files that you don't need. And for referencing the actual installer for download, we just use the GitHub Release artifact that we post, all thanks to our earlier decision to build on GitHub.</p>
        <p>Once you submit your package to Chocolatey, it goes through two automated steps of validation and it will spit out some advice that can be required and block your package from being released or it will spit out recommended changes like adding specific links or documentation. If these pass, the package enters 'moderation', and an actual human will review the package before it is released. This can take days to weeks, and is a drawback. Chocolatey does have Business …</p></div></div>

    <div>
            
            
            
            

            
            <div>
                <div>
                    
                    <article>
                    
                        
                    <div><p>With the advent of Vue 3's composition API, one may write local states and its tightly coupled actions like given below:</p>
<pre><code>// maths.js
import { ref } from 'vue';

export function useMaths() {
  const val = ref(0);

  const increment = () =&gt; (val.value += 1);
  const decrement = () =&gt; (val.value -= 1);

  return {
    val,
    increment,
    decrement,
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>This should look eerily similar to what React offers (if you have used React hooks).</p>
<p>The above code creates a reactive value called <code>val</code> and provides two actions to either <code>increment</code> or <code>decrement</code> this value.</p>
<p>This hook or a composable function can be imported into a component and used directly like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  {{ val }}
  &lt;button @click="increment"&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button @click="decrement"&gt;Decrement&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  import { useMaths } from './maths';

  export default {
    setup: () =&gt; {
      const { val, increment, decrement } = useMaths();
      return {
        val,
        increment,
        decrement,
      };
    },
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The component binds the value and actions to the Vue template. This <code>useMaths</code> hook can be imported into any number of components and the behaviour can be reused while keeping the states local to the component in which it was used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vue 3 not only allows us to compose the components and the UI but their behaviour as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="but-what-do-you-do-when-you-realise-that-the-state-should-have-been-global-instead%3F">But what do you do when you realise that the state should have been global instead?</h3>
<p>There are times when you could be thinking that a particular state should be local to a component or a page. But as the app progresses on, this assumption may not hold true anymore.</p>
<p>Or there might be instances where you just wanted to experiment with the component and flesh out the internal workings while keeping the implementation simple by using local states. But once the experimentation phase is over you just want to reuse the code as much as possible and adapt it to use a global state.</p>
<p>In these above scenarios, Vue 3 gives us a new trick that we can do with <code>ref</code> that makes this sort of <strong>migration</strong> negligibly cheap to implement.</p>
<p>See what we do to make the state global in the code below?</p>
<pre><code>// maths.js
import { ref } from 'vue';

const val = ref(0);

export function useMaths() {
  const increment = () =&gt; (val.value += 1);
  const decrement = () =&gt; (val.value -= 1);

  return {
    val,
    increment,
    decrement,
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just move the <code>ref</code> out of the context of the hook and make it global. Vue will take care of the rest. Each component that uses this hook will all share the same <code>val</code>. Now, isn't that something?</p>
<p>PS: This can be done with <code>reactive</code> as well.</p>

Both classes take a standardized test, and it turns out that the average score in class A was $5\%$ better than the average in class B.&nbsp; Statistical significance — in this regard — would be our way of determining whether the better score in class A could be attributed to <em>random chance</em>, for instance:</p><ul><li>It was a lucky day for class A.</li><li>Class A just randomly got assigned better prepared students.</li></ul><p>Or whether there is some other factor responsible for the difference in grades between the classes,&nbsp;for instance:</p><ul><li>Teacher A did a better job of teaching than teacher B.</li><li>Teacher A cheated a bit and gave the students some answers ahead of time.</li><li>The classes were purposely split up (e.g., more advanced students or native speakers of a language were put into class A).</li></ul><p>Note that in this case, we wouldn’t — using <em>only</em> the information on the scores at least — attempt to decide what the exact reason for the different scores was.

The equation for the Z-test is:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS1.png" alt="Z-Test Statistics" width="668" height="348" title="SS1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20668%20348'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS1.png"></p><p>In a nutshell, the Z-Test equation calculates the <em>ratio</em> of two quantities: the numerator on the top, and the denominator at the bottom. Let’s take a look at them individually.</p><h3 id="num"><span id="Numerator"></span><a href="#toc">Numerator</a><span></span></h3><p>The <em>numerator</em> of the equation is where the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> is accounted for:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS2.png" alt="Difference Between Sample Mean and Population Mean" width="400" height="127" title="SS2" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20127'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS2.png"></p><p>Here, $\bar{x}$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>measured average value</strong> for the data set, &nbsp;while $u_0$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>baseline average value</strong>. In terms of our&nbsp;example with fertilizer B, the baseline and the measured average would be $10$ lbs and&nbsp;$25$ lbs., respectively, yielding a magnitude of difference of:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS3.png" alt="SS3" width="622" height="89" title="SS3" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20622%2089'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS3.png"></p><p>In general,&nbsp;the larger in magnitude the final Z-value is, <em>the more significantly the sample deviates from the baseline average value</em>. In particular, having a numerator of $15$ ($25-10$) is more significant than having a numerator of $1$ ($11-10$) — all&nbsp;other variables&nbsp;being equal.</p><h3 id="de"><span id="Denominator"></span><a href="#toc">Denominator</a><span></span></h3><p>So far, we have only been focusing on&nbsp;the <em>top half</em> of the statistical significance equation. Let’s take&nbsp;a look at the&nbsp;<em>denominator</em> of the equation&nbsp;this time:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS4.png" alt="Standard Error of Sample Mean - Amount of Variation in Measured Data" width="600" height="267" title="SS4" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20267'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS4.png"></p><p>Here, $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$&nbsp;deals with the amount of variation in our measured data. More specifically,&nbsp;the amount of <em>average deviation</em> in the measured averages themselves — if we were to repeat the sampling process indefinitely.</p><p>After all, you didn’t think that your pumpkins actually all weighted $25$ lbs. did you?&nbsp; Some probably weighted $22$ lbs., and others $27$ lbs.&nbsp; The $25$ lbs. was just an average, and that measured average could change depending on the pumpkins being sampled.</p><h2 id="sd"><span id="Normal_Curve_and_Standard_Deviation"></span><a href="#toc">Normal Curve and Standard Deviation</a><span></span></h2><p>At this point, we need to take a step back and explain what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>normal curve</strong></a> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> are. Loosely speaking, the normal curve is an approximation of how things occur when they are subjected to <em>aggregated</em>, real life random events. The fact that they are random doesn’t mean that they are <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary">arbitrary</a>. As a result, they assume the shape of a <strong>bell curve</strong> as illustrated in the diagram below:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS5.png" alt="Normal Curve (Bell Curve)" width="715" height="510" title="SS5" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20715%20510'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS5.png"></p><p>On&nbsp;a related note, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>standard deviation</strong></a> is a way of measuring the <em>width</em> of the normal curve, and can be alternately defined as the distance from the center which&nbsp;encloses $68.27\%$ of the area below the normal curve:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS6.png" alt="Normal Curve - 68% of data are 1 standard deviation within the mean" width="624" height="445" title="SS6" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20624%20445'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS6.png"></p><p>Similarly, two standard deviations define the distance from the center which encloses $95.45\%$ of the curve, and three standard deviations $99.73\%$ of the curve:<img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS7.png" alt="68-95-99 Rule For Normal Distribution" width="715" height="510" title="SS7" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20715%20510'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS7.png"></p><p>For&nbsp;a set of data with a lot of variation, the normal curve will be wide, and hence the standard deviation will be large. This would be the case if you&nbsp;take, say, the weight of $100$ rocks you picked up in your backyard.</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS8.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Large Standard Deviation" width="463" height="333" title="SS8" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20463%20333'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS8.png"></p><p>Or there could also be almost no variation in the data,&nbsp;as in the case where&nbsp;you measured the processing speed for each computer chip in a batch.</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS9.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Small Standard Deviation" width="460" height="323" title="SS9" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20460%20323'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS9.png"></p><p>Let’s think about another example — this time involving automobiles. Imagine going to a tire store and being informed&nbsp;that the&nbsp;lifespan of new&nbsp;tires&nbsp;is $50,000$ miles on average, with a standard deviation of $5,000$ miles. Using this information, we can construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a> of tire lifespan&nbsp;as follows:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS10.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve" width="719" height="518" title="SS10" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20719%20518'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS10.png"></p><p>As the graph suggests, we&nbsp;have a $50\%$ chance of being above the average of $50,000$ miles (before needing new tires again), and a $50\%$ chance of being below it. We also know that since two&nbsp;standard deviations correspond to $10,000$ miles (i.e., $5000 \times 2$), we&nbsp;have a $95.45\%$ chance of getting new tires&nbsp;with a mileage between $40,000$ and&nbsp;$60,000$ miles (i.e., two&nbsp;standard deviations within the average):</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS11.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve - Chance of Between 40,000 and 60,000 miles " width="719" height="518" title="SS11" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20719%20518'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS11.png"></p><p>Now, let’s say that a couple of years later,&nbsp;you’ve driven $55,000$ miles and your tires are in need of replacement. Would you consider&nbsp;that unusual? No, probably not, since that’s only <em>one&nbsp;standard deviation away from the mean&nbsp;</em>— which is&nbsp;well within the typical tire-to-tire variation often seen in the market.</p><p>But now, let’s say that this time you’ve driven $60,000$ miles instead before the tires need replacement. This would be&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;standard deviations<strong>&nbsp;</strong>above the average</em> — which is well above the lifespans of most new tires. In addition, since two standard deviations above the average correspond to the top $2.28\%$ of the curve $\left( \frac{100\% – 95.45\%}{2}\right)$,&nbsp;it follows&nbsp;that your tires actually lasted longer than $97.72\%$ of all other tires!</p><p>Of course, having a single measurement exceeding $97\%$ of your expected measurements is quite unusual. You have to start thinking, “Maybe there is something different about my situation than the typical installation for the same tires.” For example, it could be that:</p><ul><li>You are just a more cautious driver, and wear down the tires less quickly than the typical person.</li><li>The shop put on better tires than you thought. Maybe you got the next level up by some happy accident.</li><li>The tire company undersells their products a little bit, and it is actually better than they advertised.</li></ul><p>Or it could be that it is just a <em>typical variation</em> — and&nbsp;you happen to stumble upon&nbsp;on the right tail of the curve.</p><h2 id="mm"><span id="Multiple_Measurements"></span><a href="#toc">Multiple Measurements</a><span></span></h2><p>So far, we have seen how the normal curve applies to a single measurement. With a single measurement, it is easy to see where it would fall on the normal curve, but how would your opinion&nbsp;change if you had <strong>multiple measurements </strong>instead?</p><p>Maybe you own a fleet of cars, and you got the same type of tires on each of those cars and those tires lasted, say, $46$, $48$, $53$, $54$, $56$, $56$, $57$, $58$, $60$ and $62$ thousand miles. Do these&nbsp;additional measurements make you more or less inclined to believe that the tires last more than the advertised $50,000$ miles?</p><p>To be sure,&nbsp;we can, and will, plug those numbers in to the equation to determine the verdict. But there is an interesting reason why the equation works the way it does, and the way to understand it&nbsp;— as luck would have it —&nbsp;is to begin with some dice rolling.</p><h2 id="sda"><span id="Standard_Deviation_of_Averages"></span><a href="#toc">Standard Deviation of Averages</a><span></span></h2><p>The key to understanding statistical significance is to realize that you&nbsp;actually&nbsp;don’t care much&nbsp;about the standard deviation of the data. What&nbsp;you really care about is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Standard_deviation_of_the_mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation of averages</a> —</strong>&nbsp;a metric pertaining to&nbsp;<em>samples</em> drawn from the data rather than the data themselves, and which changes as one&nbsp;includes&nbsp;more data into the&nbsp;sample.</p><h3 id="1d"><span id="SingleDie_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Single-Die&nbsp;Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>To see how the standard deviation of averages is related to dice rolling, let’s begin our discussion by first throwing a single die. In this case,&nbsp;you have an <strong>equal probability</strong> of getting&nbsp;a $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$. &nbsp;Here’s the probability distribution of that roll for the record:</p><p><img src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS12.png" alt="Distribution of the Number on a Single Die" width="749" height="529" title="SS12" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20749%20529'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS12.png"></p><p>Here, the <strong>average roll</strong> you would get is $3.5$, and the standard deviation of the&nbsp;roll&nbsp;— which is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>population standard deviation</strong></a> of the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$ — is $1.7078$. &nbsp;Note that the population standard deviation is just a measure of how spread out a data set is, and that the greater a data point deviates from the average in the data set, the more it increases the standard deviation of the data set.</p><p>In the case of single die rolling, for example,&nbsp;a roll of a $3$ or a $4$ would contribute the least&nbsp;to the standard deviation.&nbsp;A&nbsp;roll of $2$ or $5$ would contribute a bit more, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;roll of $1$ or a $6$ would be the ones contributing the most.</p><h3 id="2d"><span id="TwoDice_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Two-Dice Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>Now, what happens if you roll <em>two</em>&nbsp;dice instead of one, and take the <em>average</em> of those two rolls? &nbsp;For one, you would get $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes in that case, which correspond to a total of $11$ possible sums&nbsp;— from a sum of $2$ to a sum to $12$.</p><p>But here’s the caveat: those $36$ different possible rolls actually don’t map evenly onto the $11$ possible sums!

This is a post I've been meaning to write for a while now: one anecdotally
comparing programming languages in the Lisp family. I consider myself to be a
Lisp hacker. Perhaps that much was obvious from the letter λ adorning my
website's header, a reference to the λ-calculus which inspired John McCarthy to
design the first LISP [1]. Yet, "Lisp hacker" likely means little unless you,
too, consider yourself to be a Lisp hacker. Calling yourself one seems carry
some level of unstated meaning. Indeed, some identify with more specific groups.
"Schemer," or "Guiler," or "Racketeer," or "Clojurist." But "Lisp Hackers" ⊇
"Schemers". There is commonality shared among all, or at least most, of these
programming languages, and the Lisp hackers recognize and appreciate that
commonality – the characteristics that make a programming language a Lisp.
Homoiconic syntax, powerful metaprogramming facilities, and editor support that,
in my opinion, is unparalleled. (Yes, I am alluding to GNU Emacs.) This article,
however, is concerned with the differences. In it, I will be considering the
specifics of each dialect, and whether or not those specifics make for a
language I would want to use to develop a new piece of software.
</p><p>
I'm specifically concerned with game development at the time of writing this
article. An idea for a turn-based tactics game came to me and I felt a Lisp
would be the best tool for realizing it, but the decision to use "a Lisp" still
leaves me with several choices. When I enumerate the notable design choices
behind each dialect, and talk about the approaches I prefer, my opinions will
be, in some capacity, framed as partial answers to the question of "will I be
able to comfortably use this to write a video game?" As such, there are a few
things I am specifically interested in:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Ergonomics</b>, or "a measure of the friction [one experiences] when trying to get
things done" [2].</li>
<li><b>Expressiveness</b>, or the ease with which code may be understood by a reader.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>, which is nontrivial to properly quantify [3]. I won't be rigorous
with this; a one-off run with <code>time</code> can give a good idea of the order of
magnitude for execution time.</li>
<li><b>Ease of distribution</b>, which is difficult to define, but with which I associate
platform agnosticism, a runtime that won't bloat my tarballs by several
gigabytes, and a lack of baroque and difficult to obtain dependencies.</li>
<li><b>Ability to interface with other libraries</b>, as I'll want to be able to
draw to the screen, and play sounds, and so on.</li>
</ul><p>
For each dialect, I'm allowing myself to use nonstandard functions. I'm aiming
for an evaluation of the practical aspects of each language, and if you were
writing software, you'd likely be using more than what's included in the R5RS or
ANSI CL standards. Though, if these nonstandard functions are specific to a
single implementation, I will avoid them. SRFI's and QuickLisp are fair game,
but CHICKEN's Eggs are not. Ah, I'm already getting ahead of myself. Yes, I will
be comparing Scheme and Common Lisp. I almost have to – the history of Lisp
tends to be spun as a schism between Common Lisp and Scheme. I will be speaking
of a few others as well. I've mostly chosen dialects for which there exists some
"game engine" type library. For R7RS (CHICKEN), there is <a href="http://alex-charlton.com/projects/Hypergiant/">Hypergiant</a>, for R6RS
(Guile) there is <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html">Chickadee</a>, for Common Lisp there is <a href="http://www.xelf.me/">Xelf</a>, and for Fennel there
is, of course, <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>.

</figure><p>
What follows are my opinions, so I'd like to lead with the background that
motivated them. My earliest "serious" experience with Lisp was with Peter
Seibel's <i>Practical Common Lisp</i>, which I picked up in high school following a
failed attempt at reading <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> The portion of the latter book that I did manage was enough to
convince me that learning <span>a</span> Lisp would be valuable, but that learning Common
Lisp may be more tractable than learning Scheme. The summer following my first
year of university, I taught myself Scheme to do <a href="http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> for <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>. Guile
quickly grew on me, and I soon began <a href="http://jakob.space/blog/transition-to-haunt.html">using Haunt</a> for my personal website. I've
been unknowingly using Emacs Lisp since much earlier – not in the sense of
writing packages – my old man taught me how to use Emacs when I was nine, but I
was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html">mostly shielded from having to write <code>setq</code> forms</a>. I've also used <a href="https://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/">Hy</a>, <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>,
… well, I'm wildly off track now. Point being, I've used many Lisps, and I've
subconsciously acknowledged the differences between them, but never turned that
acknowledgment into coherent thought.
</p><p>
To aid in the comparison, I've written the same raytracer in several dialects of
Lisp. My reasons for choosing a raytracer are that:
</p><ul>
<li>I'm reasonably familiar with how they work.</li>
<li>Performance matters, and differences in performance is noticeable.</li>
<li>It's nontrivial, but several implementations of a raytracer is also more
tractable than, say, several implementations of a high-performance database.</li>
</ul><p>
Another consideration was the number of advancements in raytracing that build
upon the same basic structure, potentially giving me a way to compare the ease
with which a change to a system can be made, but writing these raytracers took
enough out of me that I didn't want to play with them any more.
</p><p>
This was not nearly as telling of a comparison as I had hoped. Once I'd
completed the first raytracer, everything that followed had the same structure.
Regardless, writing these raytracers gave me an idea of the characteristics I
was interested in, especially performance. For anyone who would like to look at
the code, the implementations are available <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo">here</a>.

<p>
Well, if we're writing a raytracer, then, we had better have some way of seeing
the results. The issue is portability. Ideally, I'd like to be able to run the
raytacers on different implementations of each language, but none of them have
standardized support for drawing graphics. An idea I had was to render the image
to the terminal using ANSI escape sequences, but I thought the resulting images
would be quite shitty. Instead, I decided to go the <a href="https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki/Lesson-0-getting-started">route that tinyrenderer
takes</a>, which is to output to an image file. Initially, the image format I went
with was the venerable PNG. This was a mistake. Even if it did lead to a rather
elegant CRC procedure in Scheme.

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>chunk-crc</span> bytes)
  (<span>define</span> (<span>process-byte</span> crc byte)
    (bitwise-xor (vector-ref png-crc (bitwise-and #xff (bitwise-xor crc byte)))
                 (arithmetic-shift crc -8)))
  (reduce process-byte bytes #xffffffff))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Realizing PNG was needlessly complex, I went on to write a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jakob/lisp-raytracer-zoo/tree/master/write-bmp.scm">BMP encoder</a>, which
was fine until I came across <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/11/03/">an article</a> from Chris Wellons about rendering video
with C by encoding frames as <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/">Netpbm</a> images. I decided to scrap my BMP encoder
and go with PPM instead. Netpbm is text-based: the issue with a PNG or BMP
encoder in Scheme, for example, is that you're dealing with a binary format.
Glancing over the standards now, it seems there are, indeed, standardized
procedures for dealing with binary data in both R6RS and R7RS. Regardless,
dealing with those binary structures and having to consider endianness is a
pain. PPM is <span>dead</span> simple. In fact, I'd wager that if all you had access to were
the examples on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm">Wikipedia</a> page, you'd be able to write an encoder. Here's
the Scheme implementation:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>define</span> (<span>write-ppm</span> width height pixels)
  <span>"Encode the WIDTH by HEIGHT image given as PIXELS into the portable pixmap</span>
<span>format (PPM), writing the result to `(current-output-port)'."</span>
  (<span>define</span> (<span>delimit-values</span> values)
    (<span>cond</span> ((null? values)
           (newline))
          ((= 1 (length values))
           (display (car values))
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))
          (<span>else</span>
           (display (car values))
           (display <span>" "</span>)
           (delimit-values (cdr values)))))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"P3"</span>))

  
  (delimit-values (list width height))

  
  (delimit-values '(<span>"255"</span>))

  
  (<span>for-each</span> delimit-values (vector-&gt;list pixels)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you do away with my nice formatting, that's twelve lines of code, all of
which are R5RS-compatible. We have access to the Netpbm suite, too, so if we
want a PNG, we can always <code>./write-ppm | pnmtopng &gt; test.png</code>. Netpbm is a
real hidden gem. Well, hidden to me, at least.

If you aren't familiar with Scheme, it has somewhat of a self-imposed<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
reputation for appealing to academic types. It's also one of the most
opinionated languages I know of; all the specs of interest lead with an
assertion that "programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary." The way that Scheme embraces purity and
simplicity makes it clear it was designed by math nerds. (Hey, I'm a math nerd,
too. Take it easy.)
</p>

<p>
As I've just mentioned, there are specs. A few, to be sure. The evolution of
Scheme standards begins in a linear fashion: RRS → RRRS → R3RS → R4RS → R5RS. I
like to think of this as "classic Scheme". But when it came time to revise R5RS,
the ratification of the subsequent R6RS caused some controversy. It was
"bloated", or whatever. Something like that. So when it came time to design R7RS
(small), the Scheme Language Steering Committee decided to let the language
fork, beginning with the earlier R5RS as a blank slate [4]. That way, the nerds
that hated everything about R6RS could have their way, and the nerds that liked
R6RS could have their way. Scheme was divided, but at peace. Oh, and nowadays
there's a work-in-progress <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cowan/r7rs-wg1-infra/src/default/R7RSHomePage.md">R7RS-large</a>. ಠ_ಠ

I'm not going to talk about R7RS-large here. It's just too …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

  <p>The following stories were crafted in the dismal months of April, May and June, in the unfortunate year 2020. While the theme for this anthology, Bunkerpunk, was chosen in late March, the proceeding months saw real-life bunkers in the news as the world descended further into the persistent, low-grade chaos that has come to define our era. If you happen to be reading this from a bunker, we hope you’re well stocked on cola and emotionally prepared for an alien invasion. May these six works of fiction remain such, at least until you’ve had the chance to finish reading them.</p>

  <p>A month after Mohit moved, bankrupt and alone, into the underground bunker he built for 100, perimeter alarms echoed through the enormous structure for the first time. A lanky, dusty man popped up on the screens, torn-up backpack over one shoulder.</p>

  <p>Mohit pulled a baseball cap over his shaved head. He trotted through wide tunnels and up concrete stairs to the surface. Then he walked to the perimeter fencing, his body tense, his eyes glued to the lone figure. The man seemed unusually nonchalant, as if walking through the Mojave desert to a private compound miles from the closest city was something he did every day.</p>

  <p>“That laser wire up there?” the man asked, squinting up at the fence.</p>

  <p>“It is,” Mohit replied.</p>

  <p>The man observed Mohit for a minute, then asked, “this some kind of cult thing?”</p>

  <p>Mohit shook his head. He considered asking the man who he was, or turning and retreating underground, but found himself happy to be talking to anyone after a month alone. “It’s just a safe place. Safe from disease, dust storms, war, everything we’ve done to mess things up up here.”</p>

  <p>The man nodded thoughtfully, following the miles of laser wire and fencing with his eyes. Mohit waited. The air was dry, hot, and sharp. It felt dangerous, like if you inhaled it too quickly, you’d be rewarded with a nosebleed.</p>

  <p>“What’s it like inside?” the man asked, clearly in no rush.</p>

  <p>“Kind of like a big hotel,” Mohit answered. “But better! Loads of community spaces. Kitchens, movie rooms with great sound, meditation gardens–”</p>

  <p>“Meditation gardens, huh?”</p>

  <p>Mohit shrugged and adjusted his pitch. “Nice beds. Plenty of food, water, and medicine.”</p>

  <p>The man nodded, as if considering an unspoken offer. He looked past Mohit at the gray windowless edifice poking up through the sand. “Those walls–pretty thick…”</p>

  <p>“A meter thick. Mesh-embedded concrete to block radio signals,” Mohit boasted.</p>

  <p>“Zombie-proof?”</p>

  <p>Mohit felt himself blushing. He’d given dozens of interviews since his disastrous appearance on CNBC to announce his project. The one where, in a moment of youthful exuberance, he joked that the walls were so thick, “they’d even keep the zombies out.” The host chuckled, glanced off-screen and pumped his eyebrows, then turned back with a false smile, his teeth bright and sharp. Right away, Mohit knew it was over.</p>

  <p>After that, nobody cared that he’d risked all of his then-considerable fortune to bury 500 bunkers miles outside Berlin, Brooklyn, Buenos Aires, Boise, Cork, Cape town and so many others. It no longer mattered that he’d designed anti-contamination vacuum gaps and positive air pressure between sections and incorporated medical-grade fabricators, self-contained water cycling and food production, and layouts modeled on anthropological studies of successful, peaceful communes.</p>

  <p>Onstage at TED, he’d declared, “when our governments fail to take responsibility, we must rise to the challenge.” They applauded. But what spread were the SNL parodies and viral headlines: “10 Reasons Why Even the Wealthiest Preppers Aren’t Willing to Waste Money on Indombitable’s Zombie-proof Bunker.” The world thought he was a joke.</p>

  <p>Now Mohit squirmed in utility coveralls damp with sweat, the space between his skin and the thick canvas like a sauna. He thought about how much cooler it was down below.</p>

  <p>“So no zombies, then?” the man asked.</p>

  <p>“Just me.”</p>

  <p>A silence unfolded between the men standing on opposite sides of the fence. Each considered the other, the choices made to bring them there, and the options that lay before them. The man with the backpack shifted his weight from one foot to the other, then asked, “what do you got to eat? I’m Henry, by the way.”</p>

  <hr>

  <p>They came alone, then in small clumps. There were homeless men fleeing overcrowded shelters, mothers and fathers with arms full of children and eyes full of fear, trying to outrun the latest outbreak.</p>

  <p>Mohit showed each one around and welcomed them to the community. Henry developed strict quarantine procedures. A UCLA microbiologist, he’d been scorned for sounding the alarm on the rising viral threat and all but ostracized by the scientific community.</p>

  <p>As the geneticists and pharma corps fell a year behind, then two, then ten…as the mutation rate increased and new viruses tore through cities…as politicians implored people to go about their lives while they built shelters for themselves, the people kept coming.</p>

  <p>Then came the calls from would-be buyers from all over the world, offering vast sums for Mohit’s bunkers. Amounts that would have saved his company and reputation, if only they’d come a few months before. Mohit unlocked all the doors instead. What good was money when the world was on fire?</p>

  <p>A few years later, the bunkers filled and sealed shut. Decades passed. New waves of illness, climate catastrophe, and so many deaths.</p>

  <p>Outside, parking lots gave way to forest. Robins and sparrows nested in office drop ceilings, while small mammals took up grocery store shelves. Cities went wild once again.</p>

  <p>Inside, they maintained the hydroponic farms, tended to the sick, cooked together, sang together. Mohit’s empty concrete shells rang with life. He met his wife in the bunkers. Their sons were born here, raised here.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>“Shhhhh, wake up, Mohit,” Sandra said, ruffling her husband’s hair as he leaned against their bedroom doorway, tracing the notches etched into its frame with his fingertips.</p>

  <p>“Couldn’t sleep at all last night,” he said.</p>

  <p>She smiled, slipping an arm around his waist and leaning her head into his shoulder. “I couldn’t either. Thirty years. It doesn’t seem real.”</p>

  <p>They pressed against each other, lost in thought. All through the structure, people murmured excitedly. Viral transmission had fallen for 100 days straight and airborne contaminants were back to normal levels. Today the next phase would begin. One Mohit had never imagined when he’d created this place. The community had voted, and they’d decided to emerge.</p>

  <p>“I wish we didn’t have to leave those behind,” she said, nodding at the notches in the door frame. “I don’t want to forget that Munu and Sam were once that little.”</p>

  <p>“I traced them onto paper,” he said. “We can recreate them above.”</p>

  <p>Their sons met them outside their door, their faces set in wide grins. No longer children, but nervous and jittery just the same.</p>

  <p>Mohit’s heart swelled. This place had taken everything from him and given everything to him. He thought he’d earned his vindication when the bunkers filled. But he’d been wrong. This moment, when their faces met the sun and their feet felt the earth once more, when their sons would see the sky with their eyes for the first time. When they’d have a chance, along with whoever was left, to try again. This was the reason he had built them all.</p>

  <p>As the crowd moved up towards the vivid colors of rock and cactus, and into the startling warmth of the early morning sun, Munu nudged him.</p>

  <p>“Dad,” he said. “You know how we buried ourselves underground, and now we’re slowly rising to live again?”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” Mohit replied.</p>

  <p>“So we’re basically zombies, right?”</p>

  <p>Mohit smirked, nodding. Perhaps he’d just gotten it backwards. The bunkers hadn’t kept the zombies out, they’d kept them in.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Years ago, a cooking blog got me thinking about reverse-engineering recipes. I
thought I could build an application for that. For those of us privileged
enough to contribute, open source software is an endless time sync. I kept
putting off the idea for some other shiny pet project–usually
<a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a>.</p>

<p>With my work on JSHint finally maybe wrapping up, and with a whole lot of extra
time due to coronavirus-inspired lifestyle changes, I finally set out to build
the thing in March. Today, it’s done. It’s called “Ingradient,” and you can
find it at <a href="https://ingradient.com/">ingradient.com</a>.</p>

<p>To cap things off, I thought I’d write a bit about what I built and what I
learned.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>Ingradient is an application designed to help you recreate food products in
your kitchen by estimating the ingredient measures. Pick a product you’d like
to make, dial in the nutrition facts along with the ingredients, and Ingradient
will spit out measurements for each ingredient.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Ingradient works by combining the information you provide with nutrition data
published by <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/">the US Department of Agriculture</a>. It
creates a system of equations that relates the nutrition information of the
ingredients with that of the final product. By solving for the variables in
that system, it determines the mass of each ingredient.</p>

<p>So, let’s say you want to make a granola bar. Not just any granola bar, but a
<a href="https://www.naturevalley.com/product/crunchy-bars-peanut-butter/">Nature Valley™ Peanut Butter Crunchy Granola
Bar</a>.</p>

<p>You know you’ll need oats, sugar, canola oil, and peanut butter. General Mills
also uses rice flour, brown sugar syrup, and–of course–soy lecithin, but
you’re happy to skip that stuff. But still, you don’t know <em>how much</em> of each
ingredient you need.</p>

<p>…but you <em>do</em> know a bit about its nutrients. One such bar has 190 calories,
8 grams of fat, 2 grams of fiber, and 4 grams of protein. You put all that into
Ingradient, and it looks up the amount of calories, fat, fiber, and protein in
each ingredient. It builds a system of equations from all that data:</p>

<p>3.79×M<sub>oats</sub> + 3.87×M<sub>sugar</sub> + 8.84×M<sub>oil</sub> + 5.98×M<sub>PB</sub> = 190 calories<br>
0.07×M<sub>oats</sub> + 0.00×M<sub>sugar</sub> + 1.00×M<sub>oil</sub> + 0.51×M<sub>PB</sub> = 8 grams of fat<br>
0.10×M<sub>oats</sub> + 0.00×M<sub>sugar</sub> + 0.00×M<sub>oil</sub> + 0.05×M<sub>PB</sub> = 2 grams of fiber<br>
0.13×M<sub>oats</sub> + 0.00×M<sub>sugar</sub> + 0.00×M<sub>oil</sub> + 0.22×M<sub>PB</sub> = 4 grams of protein</p>

<p>With four variables and four equations, there is exactly one possible value for
each variable. Ingradient uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination">Gaussian
elimination</a> to find the
values and reports them back to you:</p>

<p>M<sub>oats</sub> = 15 grams<br>
M<sub>sugar</sub> = 15 grams<br>
M<sub>oil</sub> = 2 grams<br>
M<sub>PB</sub> = 9 grams</p>

<h2 id="how-doesn-t-it-work">How <em>doesn’t</em> it work?</h2>

<p>It’s not perfect, though, not by a long shot. This approach only works if you
can provide a nutrient measure (e.g. carbohydrates, saturated fat, etc.) for
every ingredient. For products with a bunch of ingredients, you may not have
enough nutrients. Even before you run out of nutrients, you’ll find that some
of them (e.g. sodium and cholesterol) are present in trace amounts, making them
weak signals for inferring measurements.</p>

<p>In the application’s guide, I encourage users to stick with macronutrients and
get creative with ingredient simplification. For example, a product that has
sugar, corn syrup, and high-fructose corn syrup can probably be approximated
with sugar alone (most cooks aren’t likely to have HFCS on hand, anyway).</p>

<p>The most jarring problem, though, is that the application sometimes provides
incoherent answers. Want to know how to make a Carrot Cake Larabar? Ingradient
will tell you to use 54 grams of dates, 54 grams of almonds, and -29 grams of
walnuts. While that solution makes sense on paper, it’s useless in the kitchen.
It’s hard to predict when you’ll get an answer like this, but the further your
input strays from the actual content, the more likely you are to get gibberish.</p>

<p>The application was “just for fun,” and I’m hoping folks have the same
expectations for its output.</p>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-idea">Origin of the idea</h2>

<p>In 2010, <a href="https://kenjilopezalt.com/">J. Kenji López-Alt</a> wrote an article
titled <a href="https://aht.seriouseats.com/2010/07/the-burger-lab-how-to-make-an-in-n-out-double-double-animal-style.html">The Ins-n-Outs of an In-N-Out Double-Double,
Animal-Style</a>.
In it, he used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry">stoichiometry</a> to
reverse-engineer the contents of a sandwich dressing based on the ingredients
and nutrition data provided by the restaurant that sold it.</p>

<p>This always seemed like a useful application of the chemistry process–one that
could generalize to all sorts of other cooking experiments. It’s just so
labor-intensive! I thought I could teach a computer to do it for me.</p>

<p>Although I originally envisioned a command-line tool that would never see the
light of day, I eventually decided to make this a full-fledged web application.
Doing so would allow my work to benefit someone else out there, give me an
opportunity to brush up on some new technologies, and let me proselytize for
free software a bit.</p>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>

<p>I’m a web developer by trade, but my work in recent years has been focused more
on web standards and less on soup-to-nuts application development. That made
this project an opportunity to study more practical topics. For instance, even
though <a href="https://bocoup.com/work/migrating-chromium-service-worker-tests-to-the-web-platform-test-suite">I’ve collaborated with browser developers to implement Service
Workers</a>,
I haven’t had much of an opportunity to <em>use</em> them. I finally got to experiment
with Service Workers a bit, and in “progressive web app” fashion, Ingradient is
offline-enabled. Building a search interface over a large dataset like the
USDA’s nutrition data also gave me an opportunity to work with
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a>.</p>

<p>The front-end tooling ecosystem has grown a ton in recent years, and <a href="https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4">when
people were complaining about “JavaScript fatigue” as far back as
2015</a>, that’s
saying something. Building an application of my own design let me branch out
and play with a bunch of new-to-me toys. That started with an initial
experiment with <a href="https://cycle.js.org/">Cycle.js</a>. While I appreciate the
concept, when it comes to development ergonomics, it doesn’t hold a candle to
<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>. Trouble is, React’s developed by Facebook, and I
really can’t abide by that company for much of anything. This makes me
especially thankful for <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> which offers the same
development experience with none of the ethical baggage. Along those same
lines, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a> is a non-standard
programming language that’s always left a bad taste in my mouth. I’ve had <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">the
htm project</a> bookmarked for years, and I was
thrilled for the chance to write in standards-compliant JavaScript (see also
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jugglinmike/cycle-experiment">this early experiment gluing together Cycle.js and
htm</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, okay. I’ll get off my soapbox, now.</p>

<p>The most important lessons were about my personal shortsightedness. Even though
I intentionally set out to make an application for use by others, my initial
prototype was inscrutable. I’d been thinking about this project for years, so
naturally, I knew how to use it. A few user tests made it clear that this was
<em>not</em> intuitive and that folks would need a few hints to understand what they
were looking at. It’s been years since I formally studied human-computer
interaction, and my lack of practice was obvious.</p>

<h2 id="success">Success</h2>

<p>Honestly, I’m a bit disappointed by the ways Ingradient fails. It’s mostly the
negative measurements that are getting me down; that seems like the biggest
detriment to the tool’s usefulness. I’m still wondering if I can avoid those
impossible solutions. If anyone out there has ideas (maybe an algorithm to
nudge the input until it can be solved with practical values), then I’m all
ears.</p>

<p>That said, the application proves the concept, and it usually gives a good
starting point for home-made recreations. That’s why I’m calling it a day. It’s
rare for me to have a definitive end to a side-project, so this finality is
much appreciated.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s hoping Ingradient helps you build a few recipes of your own!</p>

				<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>‍<em>Philip Clifton is a Senior Software Engineer 2 and Team Lead, responsible for guiding the overall implementation of Web technologies at FlightAware.</em></p><p>For many users of FlightAware, one of the most visible and visual experiences on the website are the maps, depicting flight data in various forms—individual flights, traffic to/from airports, and airline fleets. Perhaps the most visible application, however, is the FlightAware <a href="https://flightaware.com/">live map</a>—a product that attempts to depict all en route aircraft around the world. Making this map function presents significant challenges—there can be upwards of 10,000 aircraft en route at any given time, and that’s a <em>lot</em> of data to fetch, process, transport to the client browser, and render. Each of these steps needs to work promptly and efficiently—after all, even the most compelling map depiction will lose some of its impact if users must wait 10+ seconds for the depiction to actually load! </p><h2><strong>Web maps and tiling</strong> </h2><p>Before we get into the meat of these challenges, we’ll briefly discuss some mapping concepts. Web-based map products are ubiquitous these days thanks to tools like Google Maps, and with their popularity has come plenty of standardization in how maps work. Particularly pertinent to this discussion is how maps use <em>tiles</em> to provide a solid user experience. </p><p>When we talk about “tiles,” what we’re really talking about is breaking up data or imagery for a map into small, bite-sized chunks. Let’s use FlightAware’s classic blue base layer as an example. While we certainly have the ability to render all the content as a single large image, in practice we break this up into individual smaller images. By doing this, when a user is looking at a small subset of the globe, we can load only the tiles needed for what’s visible in the map viewport. This, in turn, saves unnecessary work and data transport—that is, loading imagery that the user cannot view. </p><p>For most cases where we use tiles on FlightAware maps, we use a three-dimensional coordinate system, which identifies tiles based on their geographical location (X/Y coordinates, corresponding to longitude and latitude) and their zoom level (a Z “coordinate”). The third zoom dimension is important, as it allows us to tailor what’s depicted on a tile to the current zoom level. When a user zooms in closely on an area, we want to show lots of detail—minor roads, airport runways, etc.—but if that same user zooms out to look at the entire US, then depicting every minor road and runway at that level would seriously clutter the map! </p><p>There is, however, a pertinent consequence of this three-dimensional system: the number of possible XYZ combinations grows at an astonishing rate. Each time we increase the zoom level by a whole number, we double the scale of the map. That is, if a distance of one mile took up ten pixels on screen, at the next zoom level it would take up twenty. The consequence of this is that given any viewport size, increasing the zoom by one means we <em>decrease</em> the geographical area depicted in that viewport by a factor of four. </p><p>Meanwhile, every tile image is always a constant pixel size, so by extension, a single tile also covers only ¼ the geographical area of the next-lower zoom level. As a result, each time we increase the zoom level by one whole number, we require four times as many tiles to represent the entire world. Extrapolating this over a typical range of zoom levels, say, 1-20, there are potentially <em>billions</em> of possible tiles. </p><p><em>More info on this XYZ tiling strategy is available at the </em><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames"><em>OpenStreetMap Wiki</em></a><em>.</em> </p><h2><strong>Types of tile data</strong> </h2><p>Now that we’ve talked about tiling strategies, let’s move on to discussing what sorts of data we can provide in these tiles. Much like image files, tiles take two general forms: <em>raster</em> and <em>vector</em>. The delineation between the two can be thought of in terms of the point at which raw geographical data is transformed into something that’s (hopefully) visually pleasing to the end user. </p><p>Raster tiles are rendered server-side into common image formats: JPG, PNG, etc. The tiles are shipped down to the browser like any other image, where the in-browser mapping software places it in its proper place alongside other tiles. </p><p>Vector tiles, however, are passed to the browser as simple raw data in a format such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a>. The mapping software is then responsible for creating a visualization of this data, placing the features described by the data in the proper place on the map, and using styling rules to control the appearance of the features. </p><p>Examples of both of these types of tiles can be seen when examining the FlightAware live map. The classic blue base layer tiles are raster images, while the aircraft are depicted as vector features. Essentially, the client receives a very long list of points (the location of each aircraft) along with other metadata that’s used to decide how to depict the aircraft. The aircraft type (e.g. Boeing 737) determines what icon is used, the aircraft’s current heading determines where it’s pointed, and other flight data such as altitude and groundspeed are used to display an informational block adjacent to an aircraft icon on a map. </p><h2>Putting it into practice: vector data for the live map (the “old” way) </h2><p>When the live map was first conceptualized, the approach taken to fetching data was straightforward: client-side maps were configured with a vector layer (that is, a layer populated with vector features), which utilized the XYZ tiling scheme outlined previously. Retrieval of the data was handled by an AJAX endpoint, which accepted the XYZ coordinates as parameters. Logic in this endpoint was responsible for transforming these coordinates into a latitude/longitude bounding box, representing the geographical bounds of the tile, which was in turn used to retrieve all current aircraft positions within that box. </p><p>A major advantage of this approach is that it’s straightforward to implement. OpenLayers, the client-side map library we use, provides very robust built-in classes for making such requests; as such, client-side code was simple (essentially reduced to the level of configuration), and server-side code was similarly straightforward. Put simply, this approach was easy to put into practice—and it worked. </p><p>However, there are some definite drawbacks to this approach. As we’ve already outlined, the nature of XYZ tile coordinate systems is that there is an entirely unique set of tiles for each zoom level, and this zoom-level specificity can be useful for providing different levels of data detail at different zoom levels. In this case, we weren’t leveraging that specificity potential at all—every tile request simply amounted to “return all the aircraft in this rectangular region.” </p><p>As a result, we were quite literally doing redundant work. Imagine if a user allowed all aircraft to load at, say, zoom level 3, and then zoomed the map in. Since this means the new map viewport is a smaller geographical area than before, and since we already loaded all known aircraft in that larger geographical area, the client already has all the data required to display after zooming—but the tiling implementation dictated that all aircraft on the map be reloaded from a blank slate! </p><p>Still, it worked, and provided a great showcase product for FlightAware for many years—until increases in position data began to turn shortcomings into actual problems. </p><h2><strong>Performance issues surface</strong> </h2><p>For the final piece of the performance puzzle, let’s briefly discuss how FlightAware stores and retrieves positions and tracks for flights. While we use PostgreSQL as our primary relational database engine, the sheer volume of positional data we receive makes storing this data in Postgres untenable. Instead, we use a separate storage system for en route flights, allowing for much better update and retrieval performance. The first iteration of this system was <em>birdseye</em>—an in-memory position database built on top of <a href="https://github.com/flightaware/speedtables"><em>Speedtables</em></a>. Birdseye served us well for many years until 2018 when it was replaced with <em>popeye</em>, which used SQLite as its underpinnings rather than Speedtables.</p><p>Both of these share a similar performance concern, though this concern was much more prevalent with birdseye. Specifically, for the bounding-box search use case, the amount of time needed to retrieve a set of positions is roughly proportional to the number of matching positions found in the result set. For example, a bounding box containing 1,000 aircraft positions would take approximately ten times as long to fetch as a box containing 100 positions. </p><p>One might be tempted to think that this problem would only apply to boxes (aka tiles) of vastly different sizes, but that’s not the case. After all, en route aircraft aren’t evenly distributed around the globe by any stretch of the imagination. To illustrate this, let’s look at an exemplar live map, overlaid with the applicable XYZ tile grid: </p><figure id="w-node-40dd31ca13df-ee8f12ee"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e8ca9724a691dab28971e3f/5ecdb025d37e264523519790_hoV3aNpnoGA8gqFd2IYWj2tpo4zlPnFx9h0i8_GbPgjJDSERab9JwNPhg0bLmKOcZfhQDwVjRNa5Wb77U31TfcZmFIWhV25Onm7g4KiWRBLnT84dzpQPz2N7vMEc0cL5n3bWTbw6.png" alt=""></p></figure><p> Now, imagine loading the North and South Atlantic Ocean tiles (2,1,-2 and 2,1,-3 respectively) in a map client. The South Atlantic tile loads in less than a second, while North American tiles could take several seconds. The result, to the end user, looks somewhere between not great and outright broken. It’s certainly a bad look for a flagship visualization of our flight data. </p><p>A traditional way to reduce the impact of this discrepancy would be via strategic caching, but here our choice of tile grid becomes problematic again: as we discussed, there are potentially <em>billions</em> of distinct tiles, which means the chances that any particular tile is cached at any particular time is slim. There’s far too much variance in possible tiles for caching to be effective. </p><h2><strong>Moving forward</strong> </h2><p>We’ve now seen the state of the live map as of a few years ago: slow, patchy loads on the client, redundant calls to data endpoints putting unnecessary extra load on our services, and mostly-ineffective caching. Clearly, this was a situation that called for a new solution, and the direction in which we decided to go involved …</p></section></div>

    <p>Most days Jonathan woke up and carried out his simple monastic routine of self-study and meditation, but today was different. Today Prior Philip would take him into the city.</p>

<p>While most of the monks had grown weary of the city before joining the monastery, Jonathan had lived with the monks as long as he could remember. Prior Philip had found him as an abandoned newborn in the forest, just off the road that led into the monastery. He brought the infant to the church, convinced that there was a plan for him and that it was the monksâ€™ duty to raise him as their own.</p>

<p>Now eighteen years later Jonathan was looking forward to leaving the small village for the first time.</p>

<p>Jonathan had donned his monastic robes and was ready when Prior Philip came to get him. It was a relatively short distance to the city walls by horseback and they would be there within the day.</p>

<p>â€œWhat do you expect to see?â€� Philip asked him as they began the journey.</p>

<p>â€œI really donâ€™t know, I think Iâ€™d rather wait than attempt to guess.â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan thought of the stories he had read, tales of castles and princesses, kings, earls, and conquest. He imagined that some of these things must be true, but didnâ€™t want to speculate.</p>

<p>He was not prepared for what he saw.</p>

<p>As they approached the city they could see enormous walls surrounding it. Jonathan noticed a guard standing near the entrance to the city. The guard was shouting, â€œSign Up! Sign Up! Sign Up!â€� and then more quietly, â€œor Log In.â€� Philip approached and there was some quiet communication with the guard, then Jonathan walked up and was asked to fill out some documents. Shortly after, Jonathan and Philip walked in together. Once inside the city walls Jonathan saw people extending to the horizon in every direction, men, women, and children. All of them were working tirelessly on small plots of land.</p>

<p>â€œThere must be millions of them.â€�</p>

<p>Philip looked at Jonathan. â€œBillions.â€�</p>

<p>They approached one of the small plots and Jonathan looked more closely at the serfs working the data fields. One man was tending to multiple plots simultaneously: Jonathan saw him watering a beautiful garden of tweets, and then pruning a leafy Facebook post. At the same time he noticed the knights nearby also staring at the man.</p>

<p><img src="https://zalberico.com/assets/serfs_farm.jpeg" alt="Jonathan and Philip at the Serf's Farm"></p>

<p>He looked at Philip and asked, â€œWho are they?â€� nodding in the direction of the knights.</p>

<p>â€œThose are the knights of Earls Zuckerberg and Dorsey. They are expert farmers employed by the earls. They watch all of the serfs and collect clippings of all of their work on the data fields to bring to the Earlâ€™s castle.â€�</p>

<p>At that moment a small man with a determined expression walked up to the serfsâ€™ fields with a scroll of parchment. He unrolled it and began shouting at the serfs.</p>

<p>â€œThe herald of the Earl reminds you that the local baker has delicious bread on sale now!â€�</p>

<p>â€œAre you interested in Triplebyte? You could become a knight and change your life!â€�</p>

<p>â€œOur mighty king reminds you he is the greatest king weâ€™ve ever had!â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan was waiting for the herald to stop with his pronouncements so he could speak again, but the herald continued.</p>

<p>â€œMeet single serfs in your relative location!â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan looked at Philip and decided to try to just ignore the herald.</p>

<p>Philip had been watching Jonathan take it all in - he wanted him to see it for himself without any context for the first time. He led Jonathan away from the heraldâ€™s shouting so they could speak more easily.</p>

<p>Philip looked at Jonathan, â€œThere was a time long ago when there were no earls, or heralds, when the data fields were worked by skilled farmers and craftsmen. What they built was their own.â€�</p>

<p>â€œWhat happened?â€�</p>

<p>â€œIn those days it was difficult to prepare a field for data farming. It required a dedicated farmer interested in the art of farming itself. There was more creativity, but there were also fewer people and fewer farms. It was then that some enterprising young farmers hatched a plan. They realized that if they did the hard work of preparing the fields they could get everyone to farm, not just the experts. They cultivated enormous swaths of land and gave it away to the serfs in exchange for clippings of what they grow on their data farms as well as requiring them to hear the heraldâ€™s pronouncements.â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan thought about this for a while.</p>

<p>â€œThat sounds like a good thing? Many serfs had no farms at all and now they all have at least one. They all can participate in growing their own beautiful data and they only need to share clippings of it with the Earl and listen to some announcements - that seems fair to me.â€�</p>

<p>â€œMany thought the same when they first learned of it, but as more began to farm, unexpected things started to happen.â€�</p>

<p>Philip pointed to one of the nearby plots. Jonathan watched some of the growing tweets. One was particularly beautiful, brightly colored, pleasant and happy. It shone briefly and then withered and died. The next row over, he saw an angry-looking thorny retweet with comment.</p>

<p>The knights ran over to the retweet filled with excitement. â€œThis one is perfect,â€� they exclaimed, and grabbed clippings of it and began to spread it to all of the nearby data farms.</p>

<p>Jonathan looked at Philip, confused, and asked, â€œWhy are they doing this?â€�</p>

<p>â€œIn the beginning not everyone tended to their free data farms. Many did not know what to do with them, some only planted one or two tweets and then abandoned them entirely. This disappointed the earls of our kingdom. If they donâ€™t encourage growth, their share of the data harvest is smaller, thereâ€™s no one to hear their pronouncements, and all of the land they spent time cultivating is wasted. They realized that not only do they need to make the land easy to cultivate, but they need to make the serfs want to cultivate it. They experimented for a while and learned that new types of controversial, viciously competitive crops are great for encouraging data farming - they call this type of encouragement â€˜engagementâ€™.â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan was skeptical. â€œIf thereâ€™s too much controversy wonâ€™t people leave the earldom entirely?â€�</p>

<p>Philip replied, â€œI would have thought so, but it seems the opposite is true - controversy encourages more to join the data farms. The earls do now attempt to stop some of the most invasive and harmful crops, but now even that creates controversy so it no longer negatively affects engagement.â€�</p>

<p>â€œWhat is done with the data from the harvest?â€� Jonathan asked.</p>

<p>â€œThe earls collect all of it and then sell announcements to the king and wealthy merchants. They target these announcements to serfs based on their data harvest.â€� Philip replied.</p>

<p>â€œWhat kind of announcements?â€�</p>

<p>â€œThey can be anything, mostly theyâ€™re merchants selling services, sometimes they are messages from the king. One of the main concerns today is that many messages are lies from enemy kingdoms, but now there are even lies from our own king.â€�</p>

<p>â€œWhy do they allow lies from enemy kingdoms?â€�</p>

<p>â€œThere are so many farms and so many pronouncements, itâ€™s hard to check all of them first.â€�</p>

<p>â€œWhy allow lies from our own king?â€�</p>

<p>â€œWell, he is the king.â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan thought for a moment, â€œDo the serfs ignore these pronouncements? It looks like theyâ€™re not paying much attention to them.â€�</p>

<p>â€œMany of the serfs think they are unaffected by the pronouncements, but they are all affected. Thatâ€™s why the data harvest is so valuable to the earls. The pronouncements and engagement have led to serfs sharing lies, friends have become enemies, even mobs have broken out in violence. The knights are incentivized to fan the flames to keep the serfs farming and confusion and misunderstanding is everywhere. Tyrant kings use pronouncements to control their people and spread lies in enemy kingdoms.â€�</p>

<p>Jonathan thought about this for a while. He was glad at least their earls were mostly benevolent, but wondered what would happen if new earls took over. As he was thinking, he noticed one of the farming serfs sit down to rest. The knights nearby whispered nervously to each other, then surreptitiously threw a few small likes at the feet of the serf. Newly invigorated, the serf began to work again and the knights were pleased.</p>

<p>Jonathan looked upset. â€œWhy do the knights support this work? They are skilled farmers, couldnâ€™t they tend their own land?â€�</p>

<p>â€œThe earls offer the knights a comfortable life, high salary, and pleasant work (though curiously poor housing). Life outside the earldom is uncertain and difficult.â€�</p>

<p>â€œDo no knights strike out on their own?â€�</p>

<p>Philip was quiet for a moment. He pointed across a vast vista to a large castle in the distance adjacent to that of their own Earl Zuckerbergâ€™s. â€œThat is the castle of Sir Brian Acton of the former Earldom of WhatsApp. Sir Acton was an idealistic farmer who rejected the ways of our earl. He promised the serfs he would take no part of their  data harvest they produced from the land he provided them, and instead the serfs even paid him a small cash fee for his protection. He had no knights to watch and report on his people and no heralds spreading pronouncements.â€�</p>

<p>â€œWhat happened?â€�</p>

<p>â€œHe was too successful. Earl Zuckerberg saw many of his serfs begin to leave his lands to work the lands of Sir Acton (at the time he was known as Farmer Acton). This was a risk to the power of Zuckerbergâ€™s earldom, since an earl without serfs to tend to the data fields has no harvest to interest others. In the end he offered Sir Acton a knightship and such enormous wealth that he could not refuse. Itâ€™s said he now lives in that vast castle alone, is rarely seen, and rarely speaks. The serfs that were in agreement with him now belong to Earl Zuckerberg as they had before, their deal was broken, and once again they tend to our earlâ€™s data harvest.â€�</p>

<p>â€œAre there no others?â€�</p>

<p>â€œSir Acton was just the most …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

        This is an edition of the Napkin Math newsletter, where you'll receive
        an occassional problem to practise your order-of-magnitude calculations.

<p>Napkin friends, from near and far, it’s time for another napkin problem!</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this newsletter I’ve posed problems for you to try to
answer. Then in the next month’s edition, you hear my answer. Talking with a few
of you, it seems many of you read these as posts regardless of their
problem-answer format.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve decided to experiment with a simpler format: posts where I both
present a problem and solution in one go. This one will be long, since it’ll
include an answer to last month’s.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy this format! As always, you are encouraged to reach out with
feedback.</p>

<h2 id="problem-10-is-mysql-s-maximum-transactions-per-second-equivalent-to-fsyncs-per-second">Problem 10: Is MySQL’s maximum transactions per second equivalent to fsyncs per second?</h2>

<p>How many transactions (‘writes’) per second is MySQL capable of?</p>

<p>A naive model of how a write (a SQL insert/update/delete) to an ACID-compliant
database like MySQL works might be the following (this applies equally to
Postgres, or any other relational/ACID-compliant databases, but we’ll
proceed to work with MySQL as it’s the one I know best):</p>

<ol>
<li>Client sends query to MySQL over an existing connection: <code>INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Sneaker', 100)</code></li>
<li>MySQL inserts the new record to the write-ahead-log (WAL) and calls
<code>fsync(2)</code> to tell the operating system to tell the filesystem to tell the
disk to make <em>sure</em> that this data is <em>for sure</em>, pinky-swear committed to
the disk. This step, being the most complex, is depicted below.</li>
<li>MySQL inserts the record into an in-memory page in the backing storage engine
(InnoDB) so the record will be visible to subsequent queries. Why commit to
the storage engine <em>and</em> the WAL? The storage engine is optimized for serving
query results the data, and the WAL for writing it in a safe manner – we
can’t serve a <code>SELECT</code> efficiently from the WAL!</li>
<li>MySQL returns <code>OK</code> to the client.</li>
<li>MySQL eventually calls <code>fsync(2)</code> to ensure InnoDB commits the page to disk.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97400/87759326-21adeb00-c7dc-11ea-89c7-559ca11530e8.png" alt="Napkin_10"></p>

<p>In the event of power-loss at any of these points, the behaviour can be defined
without nasty surprises, upholding our dear ACID-compliance.</p>

<p>Splendid! Now that we’ve constructed a naive model of how a relational database
might handle writes safely, we can consider the latency of inserting a new
record into the database. When we consult <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math">the reference napkin numbers</a>, we
see that the <code>fsync(2)</code> in step (2) is by <em>far</em> the slowest operation in the
blocking chain at 1 ms.</p>

<p>For example, the network handling at step (1) takes roughly ~10 μs (TCP Echo
Server is what we can classify as ‘the TCP overhead’). The <code>write(2)</code> itself
prior to the <code>fsync(2)</code> is also negligible at ~10 μs, since this system call
essentially just writes to an in-memory buffer (the ‘page cache’) in the kernel.
This doesn’t guarantee the actual bits are committed on disk, which means an
unexpected loss of power would erase the data, dropping our ACID-compliance on
the floor. Calling <code>fsync(2)</code> guarantees us the bits are persisted on the disk,
which will survive an unexpected system shutdown.  Downside is that it’s 100x
slower.</p>

<p>With that, we should be able to form a simple hypothesis on the maximum
throughput of MySQL:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The maximum theoretical throughput of MySQL is equivalent to the maximum
number of <code>fsync(2)</code> per second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that <code>fsync(2)</code> takes 1 ms from earlier, which means we would naively
expect that MySQL would be able to perform in the neighbourhood of: <code>1s /
1ms/fsync = 1000 fsyncs/s = 1000 transactions/s</code> .</p>

<p>Excellent. We followed the first three of the napkin math steps: (1) Model the
system, (2) Identify the relevant latencies, (3) Do the napkin math, (4) Verify
the napkin calculations against reality.</p>

<p>On to (4: Verifying)! We’ll write a simple benchmark in Rust that writes to
MySQL with 16 threads, doing 1,000 insertions each:</p>

<pre><code>for i in 0..16 {
    handles.push(thread::spawn({
        let pool = pool.clone();
        move || {
            let mut conn = pool.get_conn().unwrap();
            // TODO: we should ideally be popping these off a queue in case of a stall
            // in a thread, but this is likely good enough.
            for _ in 0..1000 {
                conn.exec_drop(
                    r"INSERT INTO products (shop_id, title) VALUES (:shop_id, :title)",
                    params! { "shop_id" =&gt; 123, "title" =&gt; "aerodynamic chair" },
                )
                .unwrap();
            }
        }
    }));

    for handle in handles {
      handle.join().unwrap();
    }
    // 3 seconds, 16,000 insertions
}
</code></pre>

<p>This takes ~3 seconds to perform 16,000 insertions, or ~5,300 insertions per
second. This is <strong>5x</strong> more than the 1,000 <code>fsync</code> per second our napkin math
told us would be the theoretical maximum transactional throughput!</p>

<p>Typically with napkin math we aim for being within an order of magnitude, which
we are. But, when I do napkin math it usually establishes a lower-bound for the
system, i.e. from first-principles, how fast <em>could</em> this system perform in
ideal circumstances?</p>

<p>Rarely is the system 5x faster than napkin math. When we identify a
significant-ish gap between the real-life performance and the expected
performance, I call it the “first-principle gap.” This is where curiosity sets
in. It typically means there’s (1) an opportunity to improve the system, or (2)
a flaw in our model of the system. In this case, only (2) makes sense, because
the system is faster than we predicted.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with our model of how the system works? Why aren’t fsyncs per
second equal to transactions per second?</p>

<p>First I examined the benchmark… is something wrong? Nope <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
products</code> says 16,000. Is the MySQL I’m using configured to not <code>fsync</code> on every
write? Nope, it’s at the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit">safe default</a>.</p>

<p>Then I sat down and thought about it. Perhaps MySQL is <em>not</em> doing an <code>fsync</code>
for every <em>single</em> write? If it’s processing 5,300 insertions per second,
perhaps it’s batching multiple writes together as part of writing to the WAL,
step (2) above? Since each transaction is so short, MySQL would benefit from
waiting a few microseconds to see if other transactions want to ride along
before calling the expensive <code>fsync(2)</code>.</p>

<p>We can test this hypothesis by writing a simple <code>bpftrace</code> script to observe the
number of <code>fsync(1)</code> for the ~16,000 insertions:</p>

<pre><code>tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_fsync,tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_fdatasync
/comm == "mysqld"/
{
        @fsyncs = count();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Running this during the ~3 seconds it takes to insert the 16,000 records we get
~8,000 <code>fsync</code> calls:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo bpftrace fsync_count.d
Attaching 2 probes...
^C

@fsyncs: 8037
</code></pre>

<p>This is a peculiar number. If MySQL was batching fsyncs, we’d expect something
far lower. This number means that we’re on average doing ~2,500 <code>fsync</code> per
second, at a latency of ~0.4ms. This is twice as fast as the <code>fsync</code> latency we
expect, the 1ms mentioned earlier. For sanity, I ran the script to benchmark
<code>fsync</code> outside MySQL again, no, <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/fe780331c6f0c6f225a70c8a37c21e0740f7c73c/src/main.rs#L491">still 1ms</a>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/sirupsen/9fd5fe9466e82df073ed8a13ed1f661f#file-napkin-bash">Looked at the
distribution</a>, and it was consistently ~1ms.</p>

<p>So there’s two things we can draw from this: (1) We’re able to <code>fsync</code> more than
twice as fast as we expect, (2) Our hypothesis was correct that MySQL is more
clever than doing one <code>fsync</code> per transaction, however, since <code>fsync</code> also was
faster than expected, this didn’t explain everything.</p>

<p>If you remember from above, while committing the transaction could theoretically
be a single <code>fsync</code>, other features of MySQL might also call <code>fsync</code>. Perhaps
they’re adding noise?</p>

<p>We need to group <code>fsync</code> by file descriptor to get a better idea of how MySQL
uses <code>fsync</code>. However, the raw file descriptor number doesn’t tell us much. We
can use <code>readlink</code> and the <code>proc</code> file-system to obtain the file name the file
descriptor points to. Let’s write a <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace"><code>bpftrace</code> script</a> to see what’s being
<code>fsync</code>‘ed:</p>

<pre><code>tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_fsync,tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_fdatasync
/comm == str($1)/
{
        @fsyncs[args-&gt;fd] = count();
        if (@fd_to_filename[args-&gt;fd]) {
        } else {
                @fd_to_filename[args-&gt;fd] = 1;
                system("echo -n 'fd %d -&gt; ' &amp;1&gt;&amp;2 | readlink /proc/%d/fd/%d", args-&gt;fd, pid, args-&gt;fd);
        }
}

END {
        clear(@fd_to_filename);

<p>What we can observe here is that the majority of the writes are to the “redo
log”, what we call the “write-ahead-log” (WAL). There’s a few <code>fsync</code> calls to
commit the InnoDB table-space, not nearly as often, as we can always recover
this from the WAL in case we crash between them. Reads work just fine prior to
the <code>fsync</code>, as the queries can simply be served out of memory from InnoDB.</p>

<p>The only surprising thing here is the substantial volume of writes to the
binlog, which we haven’t mentioned before. You can think of the binlog as the
“replication stream.” It’s a stream of events such as <code>row a changed from x to
y</code>, <code>row b was deleted</code>, and <code>table u added column c</code>. The primary replica
streams this to the read-replicas, which use it to update their own data.</p>

<p>When you think about it, the <code>binlog</code> and the WAL need to be kept exactly in
sync. We can’t have something …</p></div></div>

<p>Right before Markus Duesmann began his difficult mission, he fulfilled one of his life's dreams. Duesmann, the designated head of the German automaker Audi, hopped on a motorcycle and spent several months cruising around Europe, from Gibraltar to the Black Sea, from the North Cape to the British Isles. In all, he put more than 28,000 kilometers (17,400 miles) on the odometer.</p>


<div>
<p>That journey, Duesmann would later tell his confidants, helped him gain perspective. Indeed, there are many things he sees more clearly now: His respect for Europe, its size and its cultural diversity, he said, had grown. So had his respect for Audi's biggest competitor in the field of electric mobility: Tesla.</p><p>In the fall of 2019, Duesmann was sitting on his bike when he received a message from Berlin. The e-car pioneer Tesla was planning on opening a car factory just outside the capital. Duesmann laughed out loud. He was impressed by the Californians' audacity. "At first, none of us took Tesla seriously," the Audi CEO would later say. "Then we were puzzled - and then we were shocked by what they were capable of."</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Tesla's Model 3 is one of the best-selling electric cars in Europe, way ahead of its German competition. The only carmaker that has recently outperformed Tesla is Renault with its tiny e-car, Zoe. The Californians are also ahead of the pack with their charging stations. The company has installed almost 5,000 of its "Superchargers" in 24 European countries. By comparison: Ionity, the charging station consortium of BMW, Daimler, VW and Ford, has so far only managed to install 1,160 electric charging columns.</p><h3>The Germans Can't Keep Up</h3><p>The German government's subsidy to encourage the purchase of electric cars, which was recently increased to 9,000 euros ($10,276), is putting more pressure on automakers, with demand booming. In June alone, while the car market slumped overall, more than 8,000 e-cars were registered in Germany, a solid 40 percent more than in the previous year. Other European countries like Austria, France, Spain and Britain, are also spurring demand with their own subsidy programs.</p>

<p>Yet German manufacturers are ill-equipped for the surge in demand. Most new electric models won't hit the market for the next six to 18 months. And their ability to manufacture more of the existing models can't just be ramped up overnight.</p><p>"The car companies are suffering from bottlenecks," says Roman Zitzelsberger, head of the IG Metall union in the German state of Baden-Württemberg and a member of Daimler's supervisory board. "Especially with regard to battery cells." Anyone who orders an electric car now will have to wait up to a year to get it. For some models, German companies have even placed a freeze on new orders.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen must now increase production, deliver more e-cars and close the massive gaps in their charging networks. Otherwise, the billions of euros they poured into their e-car offensives will have been for naught.</p><h3>The Artemis Project</h3><p>Duesmann has been at his post since April and has hardly had any time to get used to the job. He's been tasked with turning the ailing premium brand back into an innovation leader, while at the same time accelerating the turnaround of Audi's parent company, VW. Duesmann is also the head of research and development at VW. Just two months after he started his new job, he spearheaded a project aimed at putting Audi and VW on equal footing with Tesla. The project is called Artemis, after the Greek goddess of the hunt.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Duesmann has put together a largely independent team of experts from across the VW Group. They will be working in a startup-like atmosphere, developing new technologies and eliminating previous deficits, particularly in software and networking. The goal is "to accelerate the development of additional car models," according to the Audi CEO.</p><p>Duesmann has experience with such tasks. As a former executive at BMW, he was jointly responsible for the famous "Project i," which the company ultimately spun off. Thanks to the e-cars developed there, BMW was able to become a frontrunner in the field for a while. However, the i3 and i8 models caused such severe losses that the Munich-based automaker lost its nerve. BMW's next generation of electric cars won't come onto the market until 2021. Project i was integrated back into the BMW Group, essentially phasing it out.</p><p>It's now up to Audi to do it better. The Artemis project managers want to be in close contact with the group's developers from the very beginning. Duesmann has been admonishing his colleagues that the company must be constantly developing new cars, "otherwise we won't manage to establish a new technology." By 2024, e-vehicles with completely new designs are set to be created, serving as blueprints for the entire Volkswagen Group.</p><h3>A Dearth of Charging Stations</h3><p>At the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, there is a fear that any new models, however innovative, wouldn't be very popular since potential customers wouldn't have enough places to charge them.</p><p>"The infrastructure is a huge challenge," VW's works council chairman, Bernd Osterloh, recently told investors, "especially in Southern and Eastern Europe." There is still a long way to go, he said, "to push ahead with e-mobility in these countries." According to Osterloh, CO2 reductions demanded by the European Union cannot be achieved if electric cars are only widely adopted in Scandinavia or the Netherlands, which have extensive networks of charging stations.</p><p>As such, preparations are already underway within the Artemis project to create a separate charging network for the whole of Europe. Artemis' role model is Electrify America, a VW subsidiary that has set up thousands of charging points in the U.S. Managers at the company recently presented the project to their German colleagues and made a big impression. The expansion of the charging network, with its price tag in the billions, was part of the settlement with the U.S. authorities for Volkswagen's diesel scandal but it has turned out to be a strategic advantage for VW in the world's second-largest car market. Also having its own network in Europe could prove to be a major selling point for the company.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>The Artemis team's plans foresee Audi customers initially getting exclusive access, after which Porsche drivers would also be allowed to charge their vehicles at the stations. It's still unclear whether other VW Group brands, or even competitors, will also be given access. The first step, therefore, would be a closed network similar to Tesla's. Premium customers could reserve a charging port in advance to avoid waiting times.</p><p>Other offerings are in the works, too, services that could make waiting times while charging more pleasant for customers - and that would ideally get them to spend more money. One idea is to cooperate with retailers who could open pop-up stores near the stations. The project is in its infancy. Issues are still being discussed like whether the charging stations should be installed primarily along major traffic arteries or also in cities. The plans are expected to further coalesce this fall.</p>

<h3>Countering the Asian Giants</h3><p>Other manufacturers doubt that shortfalls in charging infrastructures can be closed if everyone goes it alone. Markus Schäfer, a member of Daimler's management board whose portfolio includes group research, has called for "a coordinated approach between car companies, power utilities and politicians." Schäfer says the German government would be well advised to use its current presidency of the European Council "to make a functional charging infrastructure throughout Europe possible." This would also include creating standards for a uniform payment system.</p><p>Automakers, the Daimler manager adds, should concentrate on improving battery technology so that e-cars don't have to recharge as often. In the medium term, Mercedes is looking to increase the range of its electric vehicles to 700 kilometers (435 miles) and reduce charging times to around 15 minutes. If electric cars are no longer blocking charging stations for 30 minutes to an hour, "then gas station operators will also discover this business for themselves and set up their own charging points."</p><p>However, in order to increase the range of their e-vehicles, the companies are dependent on help from the Far East. The heart of the electric car is its battery and the corresponding software. This is what companies like CATL, Panasonic or LG Chem - high-tech companies from China, Japan and Korea – are best at. German suppliers like Bosch or Continental have decided against producing their own battery cells. The Asian companies are simply too far ahead.</p><p>But German car companies are no longer willing to acquiesce to such dominance. Schäfer says Daimler is now building a "global network of battery factories, from Europe and Asia to the USA."</p><p>The Stuttgart-based company got out of industrial mass production of battery cells in 2015. Instead, in early July, the group acquired a stake in the Chinese battery manufacturer Farasis. The plan is to build a cell factory in Bitterfeld, in eastern Germany, with Farasis as the producer and Daimler as the major customer. Another partnership will soon follow. This is how the automaker hopes to lock down the long-term supply of battery cells and gain insights into the future market. Daimler will also get to send Schäfer as its representative on the Farasis supervisory board.</p><h3>Enter Polestar</h3><p>This kind of cooperation shows how much technological change is shifting the balance of power in the automotive industry. "The lever has been flipped toward electrification," says Andreas Wolf, head of the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

      <p>Who around here hasn’t heard about the tragic and inevitable death of XMPP
(eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)? It’s a pretty common topic in
the community and around, often started by users of XMPP themselves missing a
certain feature in one or multiple specific implementations, or users of
alternative solutions. In a way this is my own version of why XMPP is or isn’t
doomed.</p>
<p>To go down this rabbit hole, we first need to set a few definitions. Most of
my readers would probably know what XMPP is, but I feel obligated to provide a
short reminder as it will allow me to highlight specific points I want to talk
about.</p>

<p>XMPP is a communication protocol, that is “nerd” speak to say it’s a language
for applications to use and talk together at a level that the end-user doesn’t
see. An example would be a chat application: your desktop or smartphone app
talking to a server that then talks to another app.</p>
<p>It is defined as a standard at the <a href="https://ietf.org/">IETF (Internet Engineering Task
Force)</a> – a standard being the specification of a protocol
(a document, in this case publicised and accessible by anyone), which allows
multiple products implementing what it describes to be able to work together
in an interoperable way.</p>
<p>Core specifications of XMPP are written so that it is easily extendible
allowing any developer to use custom (XML) elements for their own use, and
optionally write a specification for their new feature for everyone else to
use.</p>
<p>XMPP also defines a client-server-server-client model, where a client can talk
with a server that can then talk with multiple servers before reaching other
clients, thus allowing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization#Technological_decentralization">decentralization</a> – anyone setting up their own
server to be free from restrictions of other operators, and communicating with
the world or part of it.</p>
<p>So there we have it: (IETF) <strong>Standard</strong>, <strong>Decentralized</strong>, and
<strong>Extensible</strong>. These are, I believe, the 3 selling-points of XMPP.</p>
<p>From there tons of features can be implemented and then negotiated (as part of
the extensibility) and many things can change to use newer extensions that
weren’t considered in the core specifications. For example even the
serialization format (words of the language applications talk, originally XML)
can be changed (just as <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0322.html">EXI</a> is doing), and it’s also perfectly
fine to have non-compliant behaviour as long as it has been negotiated by
entities taking part in it. And so on…</p>
<p>The <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XSF</a> (XMPP Standards Foundation, previously known as Jabber Software
Foundation) is the entity that did the original work on the protocol and
submitted it to the IETF. It now has a sheperding role. There is no
requirement that XMPP extensions be brought to the XSF, but it aims to be the
place where technical knowledge around XMPP is gathered, so people can get
better feedback when submitting their new specification. Developers have
already layed out lots of protocol bricks for others to reuse through the XSF.</p>

<p>This is indeed the core of the problem. While extensibility is one of the
strenghs of XMPP, it’s also its main weakness, one of the main points of its
critics. That said, I believe it’s not as bad as they make it look like.</p>
<p>It is true that most applications are incompatible one way or another, with
various degrees of significance, either because they don’t implement the same
set of extensions, or because an author interprets extensions differently,
or simply because of bugs.</p>
<p>For the rest of this article I will leave aside the last two points –
interpretation issues and bugs – as I consider both of them bugs – of
specifications and/or implementations – and bugs happen everywhere and can be
fixed. Generally, determining what is a bug and what is a (unintended?) feature
is where the issue lies.</p>
<p>While there have been attempts within the XSF at defining common sets of
extensions in what is called “Compliance Suites” (currently updated on a
yearly-basis: <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0423.html">2020</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0412.html">2019</a>, etc.), they have in my opinion
had mild success for the effort it takes the author to gather feedback and
come up with not-so-controversial changes for newer revisions.</p>
<p>What these Compliance Suites don’t take into account so well, despite recent
efforts; and what critics don’t account for either when saying XMPP is
missing X, or that all implementations should do Y, is that it’s not just
about features and protocols.</p>
<p>The process of coming up with a common set of extensions for an implementation
requires a lot more groundwork. This includes figuring out who the userbase
is, and how the experience for it should be, i.e., design. This process should
be applied across a set of implementations, using the same design guidelines and
ensuring interoperability.</p>
<p>It is not enough if somebody using <a href="https://conversations.im/">Conversations</a> on mobile talks to somebody
else using <a href="https://dino.im/">Dino</a> on desktop, even if they both follow the Compliance Suites
for a given year and can then interop on a “basic” level, which to be honest, is
still pretty advanced, they have different design guidelines and there will
inevitably be areas where they differ and some features won’t behave as
expected on the other side. The issue is not that there is no design
guidelines, it’s that they’re not the same.</p>

<p>Multiple solutions following this design process already exist, such as
<a href="https://www.xabber.com/">Xabber</a> and <a href="https://tigase.net/tigase-instant-communication">Tigase</a>. <a href="https://snikket.org/">Snikket</a> is a new addition in this domain. You can
read about its goals <a href="https://blog.prosody.im/introducing-snikket/">in the introduction article</a> or in a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xmpp/comments/f0el07/can_someone_explain_to_me_whats_the_point_of/fgto5h0/">more detailed explanation</a> from its author. At the time
of writing it is composed of a rebranded <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> (server) and Conversations
(client), is entirely based on XMPP and federates with the XMPP network. But
the important part – and also why it deserves a name other than “XMPP” – is
its goal: to provide a server and a (set of) client(s) that interoperate
properly and have common design guidelines that match the expected userbase.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not part of Snikket’s target, in which case there might someday
be a similar solution that’s more adapted to your use-case. For the more
technical of us who understand the protocol and/or can deal with less unified
designs, it may be ok to continue using our current applications and work
around these issues ourselves. For the mass audiences I believe this is not an
option.</p>

<p>To the question I set to answer at the beginning I say this: Why does it
matter? For whom? My goal is to bring standardization, decentralization, and
extensibility to mass audiences. Not to bring XMPP to them. As explained above
I believe we need product suites with common design guidelines, and they
should include these properties. XMPP has good building blocks but lacks
consorted design.</p>
<p>I want decentralization and standardization to prevent users from being locked
in closed – often also proprietary – silos such as WhatsApp, Hangouts,
Slack, MS Teams, Tik-Tok, or even Signal. And I want extensibility to prevent being
stuck in the past and to adapt to the people’s needs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>With everyone working remote, teams are on Slack more than ever. Sometimes too much. It can feel like you’re chatting all the time, but still struggling to know what’s happening. If you’re feeling a bit of Slack overload right now, you’re not alone. We talk with hundreds of tech teams, and so many are overloaded with communication yet feeling more disconnected than ever.</p><p>We founded Range to help teams who are struggling to stay in sync. So this problem is near to our heart. We <a href="https://www.range.co/product/slack">designed our product</a> with a simple concept: that taking a few minutes to check-in with your team each day actually ends up saving everyone time. When teams build a cadence of sharing what’s happening, it means there’s less time wasted in Zoom meetings delivering status updates, and fewer Slack messages that interrupt deep work.</p><p>With Slack’s <a href="https://api.slack.com/" rel="noopener">new APIs</a>, we saw an opportunity to build the best Check-in experience possible within Slack. We spent the last few months building that vision. If you’re a remote team that feels disconnected, you can install our Slack app to help your team build the habit of checking-in, and start feeling connected again.</p><h3>The best way to Check-in with your team on Slack</h3><p>Here’s everything you need to help your team get started with Check-ins, all from within Slack:</p><p>👍 <strong>Easy setup</strong> — Sign in to Range with your Slack account, invite your team, and be ready to go in minutes. We’ll guide you through every step.</p><p><strong>⌚️ Reminders</strong> — No need to nag your team for status updates. Range sends everyone a reminder message each morning to check-in.</p><p>✅ <strong>Check-ins </strong>— Everyone on your team can quickly share a list of what they plan to do, and they’ve recently accomplished, all without leaving Slack.</p><p>📎 <strong>Integrations</strong> — Easily attach work from tools like GitHub, Jira, Asana, Google Docs, Calendar, and <a href="https://www.range.co/product/integrations">many more</a>.</p><p>✨ <strong>Build team culture</strong> — We’ve included over 300+ team questions to help your team grow closer even when everyone’s apart.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/c9fc4465a950402f7947341666c9a7623a588203-1920x1162.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Screenshots of Range Slack App"></p><h3>All the little details</h3><p>We listen to our customers and obsess over the details. Here’s just a few of the thoughtful features we’ve built in collaboration with early testers:</p><p>🧵 <strong>Threaded notifications</strong> — Keep your team channel tidy with one thread that organizes everyone’s Check-in each day.</p><p>💬 <strong>Comments</strong> — Reply to comments from within Slack. You can even see the whole message thread for context.</p><p>🔖 <strong>Remember tasks</strong> — When someone asks you to do something in Slack, just click the [...] button on the message and choose “Add to my plan” in Range.</p><p>🤓 <strong>Slash commands</strong> — For you experts, we’ve added a bunch of new commands. “/checkin” lets you check in to Range from anywhere.

A little while ago a friend of mine by the name of John Munroe sent me this great little Olivetti 32 ‘Katakana’ typewriter. I’d been keeping an eye out for such a machine for a number of years now, but as you may expect – such typewriters are generally non existent in markets that are available to Australia.</p>
<p>I spoke to John a little while back after he found a Royal that was set up for Japanese somewhere online, and I asked him to keep an eye out for one for my foreign language collection. John lives in Tokyo, and was confident that he’d come across another one pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And quickly he did. It wasn’t long before he managed to get his hands on this magnificent Olivetti Lettera 32. Of all the L32’s I have had, after this guy was cleaned up I found that &nbsp;types nicer than any other machine I have ever owned of this model.</p>
<p>So John Munroe. I owe you heaps, and much more than a huge, huge thank you!</p>

I’m very grateful to John for sending me this machine. Back when I was at high school, we were required to study two languages. Japanese and German. I was far better at German than Japanese, but I have long had a fascination with Japanese &nbsp;culture. My sister also lived there for 10 years and is fluent in Japanese.</p>

Katakana is only one piece of Japanese written language, and is often used to articulate English words into Japanese.</p>

The history of the Katakana keyboard dates right back to the late 1800’s. But it really came into existence in the 1920’s &nbsp;when some members of society in Japan were pushing for a simplified or reduced version of the Japanese language. The idea was to use that Katakana syllabary in a gestalt structure that is closer to the structure of European languages. While earlier keyboards were designed with a full set of Katakana glyphs (Kana), later they used dead keys on keyboards to allow the completion of characters.</p>
<p>This Olivetti has a couple of dead keys. Note the placement of the ‘P’ key? Right next to that… On the left, is the first dead key to be found on the keyboard. If found this positioning especially peculiar.</p>
<p><b>But wait..</b></p>
<p>What about the English characters on this typewriter?</p>
<p>Ahhhh yes… Well… That decreases the Kana (Katakana means Fragmented Kana) characters used one this keyboard.. Right?</p>
<p>The thing about katakana is, that it is also used in circumstances where English words are crammed into Japanese language – in the way that in English we italicise foreign language words.</p>
<p>So what does this typewriter do?</p>
<p>John’s suggestions that it is a typewriter that would be in use by telegraph operators to move between Japanese and English is a pretty sound one. Katakana can be used as a simplified Japanese language.</p>
<p><a href="https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="2752" data-permalink="https://filthyplaten.com/2016/07/23/__trashed/fullsizerender2/" data-orig-file="https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="fullsizerender2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=700" src="https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=700 700w, https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://filthyplaten.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/fullsizerender2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a><br>
But it could also be used in a studio to produce Katakana segments for English words on this machine – when the writer was using a different keyboard featuring other kana – Say… Hiragana. But I don’t think so. The push in Japanese society was based around making language more universal. Contentiously, several key developments occurred when there was a push in Japanese society towards using English langauge more universally. Although the by the late 40’s – post World Ward 2, there was also a push towards using French.</p>
<p>Either way, in the 20’s the first Typewriters &nbsp;were being produced based to write a &nbsp;in romanized gestalt structure in Katakana. Just for reference, the company that produced these first machines was Underwood – who Olivetti eventually bought and absorbed into their organization.</p>
<p><b>Let’s not mention Kanji.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>No… Let’s. Let’s talk about Kanji.</p>
<p>Written Japanese language can be something of a horror to people that grew up outside of Japan. Even inside of it, there’s plenty of things that can – and do – often go wrong. It’s not that romanised languages are perfect – but the diverse structure in Japanese (a problem also shared with Chinese languages) often causes complexities. The positive thing about Kanji is that it allows for quite an efficient expression with more nuance.</p>
<p>So… Like every other language in existence, there’s plenty of people that take a much more puritanical view to their language and many &nbsp;in Japan resisted change. The problem was that there wasn’t much of a way to easily produce written documents on a machine. Considering that the Japanese language has thousands of characters – it obviously wasn’t going to be easily presented on the keyboard unless the keyboard was huge.</p>
<p>Enter item number 2 that is new to my collection. &nbsp;Welcome to the Nippon Type.</p>

Over a century ago the Japanese started producing heavy and lumbering machines that had thousand of typeface characters that operated wtih a feed mechanism which pulled characters out of a grill. It involved moving the carriage over the top of the grill and positioning it above the character and then feeding it upwards to a type hammer that pushed it against the page and the ribbon. It then drops the hammer back, and the character falls back into the grill.</p>
<p>This mechanism improved dramatically in later years, and instead of a moving carriage, the grill floated on a rack which moved under the carriage.</p>
<p>Eventually a character board was put in front of the carriage, allowing the user to type by moving the arm that was connected to the grill, that has a stylus on the end that the user points at a desired character with.</p>
<p>The characters are grouped into syllabary or kana, and kept together in an order that is predictable. As you can see in the photo below such groups are colored to make it easier for the typist.</p>

<p>On the left of the machine is a solid arm that has a black knob that operates the character pulling mechanism. The small black lever next to that is the space bar. This allows the typist to quickly use operate with their left hand, while swinging the arm with the stylus with their right – selecting characters and quickly tapping it in.</p>
<p>The carriage has a large black lever that operates like every other carriage lever. Interestingly, the machine is set up to type right to left with the characters positioned to be read along the page, rather than down it as was traditional. Maybe the Katakana brigade made some in-roads there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the typewriter also has a group of Roman characters grouped on the machine, allowing the user to type in English – or at use least English word. These are also regarded as Kana – and known as Romaji.</p>

The characters are kept in a smooth moving tray that feels like it is floating under the machine. When the mechanism operatingarm is pulled down on the machine you can feel the tray Bing pulled into alignment to the closest character. Then the mechanism starts and the hammer makes a solid thump as it punches a character piece against the platen. It’s a surprisingly noisy operation. But quick.</p>
<p>To reduce the noise around the typewriter the rear of the machine has a noise deadening bulkhead that is supposed to absorb some of the noise.</p>
<p>But it isn’t anywhere near as fast as typing on a keyboard. The efficiencies that most typewriters produce for writers are all but wiped out by the movement which is more energy consuming than writing Kana by hand by hand.</p>

This machine belonged to a former Australian Journalist that had been living in Japan and working there. I bought this machine off his daughter who was moving house on the day that I arrived to collect it. I can understand the appeal of this machine to a journalist in a foreign country. It would give a great refer ace board to access all the Japanese Kana on, which would make it quicker to learn and access. Obviously it has some great advantages over handwriting for legibility as well</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this machine is that – unlike the lumbering and heavy old &nbsp;Japanese typewriters of the early years, this beast is surprisingly light – weighing less than an Olympia SM4 in its case.</p>
<p>Sadly though, some of the type elements are missing, so the machine isn’t complete. Although interestingly enough, type elements can still be ordered.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just a brief look at that crazy world that is Japanese typewriting. I hope you found these machines interesting. I’ll have a closer look at both and maybe their history in another post.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>GPT-3, the largest natural language processing model, was developed by OpenAI and released on 28 May 2020. Since its release, many developers tried their hands with the GPT-3 model. Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1282676454690451457%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fanalyticsindiamag.com%2Fopen-ai-gpt-3-code-generator-app-building%2F">Sharif Shameem</a>, founder of <a href="https://debuild.co/">debuild</a>, tweeted a post in which he showed how GPT-3 can code automatically just by providing instruction.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is mind blowing.</p><p>With GPT-3, I built a layout generator where you just describe any layout you want, and it generates the JSX code for you.</p><p>W H A T <a href="https://t.co/w8JkrZO4lk">pic.twitter.com/w8JkrZO4lk</a></p></div>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Shameem trained the model with just two samples, which you can see below.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cZ2KVKDmUby8gFoAP-7x1dwEMpT0aJA69j4w7u_S3y6skXTsyBQ19mzLpIPsfs2B0CppyN55W1nnGnq3V16ifakWy7MCfZC53g7eMg67ZfdtYwDdyVhZ8u0rQMuHkiVDU_jAmqPQ" alt=""></figure>



<p>However, this doesn’t mean that it can write the complete code for your projects. Such short tricks work well on social media and might not be able to help you immediately. Undoubtedly, this brings us to the question of whether AI can code. Maybe someday it would, but we are no way near to rely on AI for writing code.</p>

<p>Currently, OpenAI’s GPT-3 is overhyped, which was also pointed by the CEO of OpenAI. “The GPT-3 hype is way too much. It’s impressive (thanks for the nice compliments!) but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out,” wrote Altman in this <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913">tweet</a>.</p>



<p>GPT-3 code generator is fascinating, and you might get your hands on it as Shameem is planning to make it public. Replying to one of the comments on this post, Shameem also mentioned that he believes that we can have AI that can code in less than ten years.</p>



<p>The use of natural language is not new; many dashboards such as Qlik and Power BI leverage NLP to pull up reports or insights from data. The reports are generated by converting the plain English text into forming code and then extracting results from a colossal amount of data. But, this is a massive development in the AI landscape, which can further the advancement of ML models that can write its own code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The travel and tourism sectors are suffering because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and governments are scrambling to offer subsidies to affected businesses. But, there is little talk on how companies are transferring their costs to citizens, with government approval.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In this case, the company is Lufthansa, who canceled my May flight from Croatia to Germany three weeks before the flight date. I booked the flight before the pandemic started, so I was a bit relieved. My reason for being in Berlin was valid for entry, but I was to either self-isolate for two weeks or get tested for COVID-19, both a hassle. If Lufthansa decided to cancel the flight and return the money, no problem.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But that is not what Lufthansa decided. Their <a href="https://svedic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lufthansa-cancelation-email.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellation email didn’t mention refunds, but offered flight vouchers instead</a>. As the email was a no-reply email, calling customer support was the only option. Lufthansa’s support representative agreed to issue a full refund. But they said that processing the refund can take up to six weeks, as they are overwhelmed with requests. EU consumer protection law requires refunds for an undelivered product or service to be issued within 30 days, but these are exceptional times, so I agreed. What Lufthansa didn’t agree to was stating that in writing, in a letter or email.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Six weeks came and passed without a refund. On a second call, Lufthansa’s support representative repeated the story. They are overwhelmed with requests, my refund will be processed in 2-3 weeks, no need to worry, but they will not provide that statement in writing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While waiting for their promise, I stumbled across an article explaining my issue as part of a bigger, EU-wide story. Lufthansa was on the verge of bankruptcy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/lufthansa-9bn-bailout-german-government-coronavirus-flights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to a €9 billion bailout from the German government</a>. In an effort to save the company, <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/lufthansa-refund-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the German government told Lufthansa that they don’t need to obey EU consumer protection law</a>, and that they don’t need to issue refunds. Lufthansa can issue vouchers for future travels instead. This situation is controversial because:</span></p><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The German government is telling a German company they don’t need to follow EU law.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The German government is playing favorites with one company. Other companies don’t have such luxury during the crisis, both in getting the loan or escaping the laws.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">German tax-payers are giving a large, risky loan to one air carrier.</span></li><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the voucher system, other EU citizens are effectively giving indefinite, interest-free loans to Lufthansa.</span></li></ul><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notice that the procedure of getting a voucher from Lufthansa is much easier than getting a refund. For a voucher, click on the link in the email and fill a form. For a refund, wait on the customer support line. But I am a stubborn person, and I hate vouchers. A few times in my life, given vouchers got unused or companies put restrictions on voucher use. In this case, there is a possibility Lufthansa will go bankrupt, and then their vouchers will be as useful as toilet paper. Wait, that may <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come in handy in COVID-19 times!</a></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I was not surprised when three weeks passed and there was no refund. I felt screwed by Lufthansa, the EU, and German politicians. However, there was still one overseas ace up my sleeve I could use.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I paid for my flight via PayPal, which offers consumer protection on purchases, and I decided to activate it. I didn’t have much hope, as worldwide pandemic cancellations were not typical PayPal disputes. Additionally, I didn’t have much proof except for the cancellation email.

                <p>Code Reviews are an essential component of the development cycle at almost every company. If you are not doing code reviews, you should probably start it.</p>

<p>Code Reviews is a process where before the code goes into production (or merged in master), some feedback is given on these code changes by a fellow developer. It is quite often the case when the developer misses out on some cases or unintentionally reduces code quality, with an extra pair of eyes such mistakes are avoided before they get to users.</p>

<p>Let’s answer the <strong>Why before How!</strong></p>

<h2 id="why">Why❓</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying naive issues like debug statements, comments in commits.</li>
  <li>Helps in following best coding practices and principles 💻 resulting in a quality, maintainable code.</li>
  <li>Eliminates bug 🕷 which got introduced unintentionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checklist-">Checklist 🚀</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No compilation errors, automated pipelines like <code>code quality</code> (which does static analysis + build) are passing.</li>
  <li>All tests are passing 💚 - both Unit and Integration and coverage is above threshold. (Run the code and test offline as well)</li>
  <li>No debugging statements or irrelevant comments 🤖</li>
  <li>Proper git log with proper messages. See, it commits are squashed.</li>
  <li>Check if PR clearly states what it does and there are no additional changes in code.</li>
  <li>See if there can be a simplified implementation for a function/feature.</li>
  <li>Are there are extra dependencies added? Can they be removed? Are they stable?</li>
  <li>Does it follow engineering practices like KISS, DRY, YAGNI?</li>
  <li>Check if any edge cases are missed.</li>
  <li>Proper logging and metrics is done. Are the logs relevant?</li>
  <li>Error is handled properly and not causes any fatal crashes ❌. (No downtimes, right! ). Code should be failure tolerant and should have a graceful shutdown.</li>
  <li>Ensure configurations are not hardcoded</li>
  <li>Check if API Documentation, README,md and Changelog 📄 are updated or not?</li>
  <li>Do these changes hamper the performance 📈 in any way? Is the response time increasing or are more DB calls are made?</li>
  <li>Do these changes need to be conveyed to other teams who consume this product/service.</li>
  <li>Are any security vulnerabilities 💣 introduced (usually there is separate whitelisting, but it’s good to do basic checks here as well)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="practices-and-tips-">Practices and Tips 💡</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ask for shorter PRs. Shorter the PR -&gt; Fewer issues + Easy to review -&gt; Less time is taken to resolve if there are any issues. Don’t do reviews for more than 60 minutes!</li>
  <li>Clearly explain in comments what you think is missing or how can this be improved!</li>
  <li>Code should be as simple as possible. If it’s easy to understand and review, it will be easier to debug later as well.</li>
  <li>Code is properly broken into small functions, it follows engineering principles like <a href="https://mohitkhare.me/blog/solid-dry-kiss-yagni/">SOLID, YAGNI, KISS and others</a>.</li>
  <li>Proper naming and description for commits, code variables.</li>
  <li>Automate whatever you can. Use <a href="https://github.com/codefactor-io/awesome-static-analysis">static analysis tools</a>. Add CI/CD pipelines for compilation, build and testing.</li>
  <li>Don’t do code reviews in a hurry ⏰ Take your time - you never know even a small condition may introduce fatal bugs.</li>
  <li>Don’t be rude, show respect! Everyone makes mistakes 🤓</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resources-">Resources 📚</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/11-proven-practices-for-peer-review/index.html">IBM practices</a></li>

<p><span>O</span>n a balmy Bangkok afternoon in March 2020, Professor Djitt Laowattana was sitting in his second-floor office in the Institute of Field Robotics (FIBO), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/world/europe/italy-coronavirus.html">watching the news</a> out of Italy. Photos of doctors with<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/21/world/health-workers-doctors-photos-coronavirus-italy-wuhan-trnd/index.html"> faces marked from their masks</a> spread across social media as the country rapidly became the epicenter of Europe’s Covid-19 outbreak. “I told my staff, stop what you’re doing and focus on this,” Laowattana told <em>Rest of World</em>. “I wanted to make sure the same thing doesn’t happen in Thailand.”</p>



<p>His concerns were correct. According to <a href="https://www.icn.ch/news/more-600-nurses-die-covid-19-worldwide">recent estimates</a> by the International Council of Nurses, nearly half a million healthcare workers may have been infected by the virus. Thailand had already confirmed its first Covid-19 death by the end of February, and <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-02-07/virus-fears-spread-thailand-chinese-tourism-magnet">experts warned</a> that the country could become the next Covid-19 hot spot in the region. Sensing the urgency, Laowattana, who is known as Thailand’s most prolific roboticist, asked his staff to drop working on the 20 or so prototypes they had in various stages in production and focus on helping him create an arsenal to fight what he called “the great virus war.” Together, Laowattana and his team of students and engineers created FIBO Against Covid-19 (FACO), a group of fully autonomous robots designed to protect doctors and nurses on the front lines of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last 20 years, Laowattana has built nearly 300 types of robots for industries ranging from food processing to automobiles, half of which are still used today. His innovations have earned him the moniker “the Godfather of Thai Robotics.” His robots do everything from disinfecting rooms and delivering supplies to remotely monitoring patients’ temperatures and symptoms.</p>



<p>In hopes of rapidly scaling the use of these robots, Laowattana also added 5G connectivity, which will allow hospitals to add as many robots as they need without overloading their systems. “I don’t like the coronavirus,” said Laowattana, “but the pandemic is a fast-forward button.”</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>Since the pandemic</strong> began, hospitals around the world have adopted robots for everything from cleaning hospital wards to allowing patients to socialize with friends and family while quarantined. Recent estimates predict the medical robotics industry will quadruple to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/surgical-robots-market-growth%E2%80%94-24-4-cagr-up-to-2025%E2%80%94says-global-market-insights-inc-300984546.html">more than $24 billion</a> by 2025, from around $6 billion in 2018. Thailand also faces a shortage of nurses, a problem that’s been exacerbated by the pandemic. Laowattana hopes his robots may be able to lighten their load and allow them to focus on more-critical tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The genie is out of the bottle,” Robin Murphy, a robotics professor at Texas A&amp;M, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “It’ll get to a point where it’s not going to shock anyone that robots are wandering around a hospital.”</p>



<p>Thailand is keen to develop its medical robots. Last year, the <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/thailand-board-investment-help-promote-medical-robotics">government announced</a> an eight-year tax break for manufacturers of medical robots and released statements encouraging hospitals to use medical robots. According to Laowattana, the virus came at a fortuitous moment.</p>



<p>After a month of blueprinting and prototyping, in early April, Laowattana introduced his arsenal to a select group of doctors from Thailand’s most prestigious teaching hospitals. He had two new robots.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“I don’t like the coronavirus, but the pandemic is a fast-forward button.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The first was CARVER. Prototyped in FIBO’s headquarters and equipped with ultraviolet lights to disinfect wards as it moves, CARVER looks like a giant Roomba dressed for a rave. The robot’s 18&nbsp;shelves also help carry medicine and other essential supplies to Covid-19 patients. Laowattana hoped CARVER would reduce the amount of exposure for nurses commonly assigned to routine but high-risk tasks.</p>



<p>The crown jewel of Laowattana’s arsenal, however, was SOFA: a 150-centimeter-tall humanoid with a conical lower half that gives it a feminized appearance. Its placid blue and white tones and three protruding high-tech cameras make it look both dainty and unsettling. One camera helps tell a patient’s temperature, while another is used for video conferencing. On its chest, a third high-definition magnifying camera allows doctors to examine a patient’s tongue or eyes without ever having to leave their offices. Like CARVER, SOFA can also be programmed to roam autonomously or controlled from afar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most telepresence robots help doctors consult with patients remotely, SOFA’s decked-out sensors also allow doctors to monitor a patient’s vitals. “When the crisis started, we didn’t have any solutions to help us examine patients from afar,” Dr. Sithakom Phusanti, deputy director at Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute in Bangkok, told <em>Rest of World. </em>Doctors at Phusanti’s hospital are among the first in Thailand to be able to examine patients in their Covid-19 ward from the comfort of their offices.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>According to a</strong> study conducted by the University of Edinburgh, hospitals have traditionally been reluctant to introduce robotics in large part due to fears of worker displacement and the negative connotations of robots for healthcare workers and patients alike. To quell some of these anxieties, Laowattana stressed that SOFA isn’t here to take their jobs. His robots have no diagnostic abilities, and when interacting with patients, a doctor is always in the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Designing robots to interact with patients also comes with its own set of challenges. While doctors can adopt a good bedside manner when dealing with vulnerable patients, giving a robot the appearance of congeniality requires both design and cultural considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laowattana created SOFA by redesigning a prototype of a greeting bot for one of Bangkok’s luxury malls. He thought its tiny stature and childlike appearance would help disarm otherwise vulnerable patients. He even tweaked SOFA to operate at 10% of its original speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In Thailand, going fast doesn’t convey good meaning. It’s impolite,” he says. When roaming the wards, SOFA projects two baby-blue eyes and a pixelated smile on a small screen, though it can show a range of positive emotions, from surprise to love. A second screen sits on its waist, allowing doctors to remotely share a patient’s medical records. Its jointed arms and fingers serve no medical purpose, but according to Laowattana, patients would rather communicate with something that looks like themselves. When interacting with patients, SOFA replaces its digital smile with a video of the controlling doctor, reminding patients that a human is still in the driver’s seat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SOFA robots have become something of a national treasure in Thailand. They have even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fibokmutt/posts/3139870376075286">earned a nickname</a> from the country’s princess: “<em>Mod Borirkasa</em>,” or “Guardian Ant.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also consequences for culturally inadequate design. In 2018, Bangkok’s Mongkutwattana General Hospital <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thailandmedical.news/news/acute-shortage-of-nurses-in-thailand-forces-hospital-to-turn-to-robot-nurses." target="_blank">met with internet infamy</a> after photos of its robots’ glowing red eyes spread across the web. Purchased from a manufacturer in China, where red is considered an auspicious color, the robots were perceived as menacing in Thailand. “People would joke, if they bring you to our hospital late at night, you better run away,” a doctor who worked at the hospital told&nbsp;<em>Rest of World</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Despite their initial</strong> hesitance, doctors and nurses at his hospital have responded positively to their new mechanical colleagues, according to Phusanti: “They believe the system can help prevent viral transmission.” So far, none of Phusanti’s staff has been infected by the virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while some doctors have been happy to adopt robotics in the wake of Covid-19, others have said the robots, at their $100,000 price tag, may be untenable for many Thai hospitals. A number of hospitals use cheaper, Chinese-produced robots, in part because they are able to receive them at low costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this concern, Laowattana has advocated for hospitals to obtain funding from the Thai government to purchase robots throughout the pandemic. While 40 have expressed interest in procuring them — pending government funding — bureaucratic delays have meant that only three hospitals have received the robots so far. The rest are still awaiting their funds to be approved.</p>



<p>Scaling the operation during a pandemic has also proven difficult, as parts have to be sourced from China and Europe. While FIBO was able to make the robots for three hospitals in-house, the institute partnered with Thailand’s Automation and Robotics Association (TARA), a consortium of industrial robotics manufacturers, to build more robots. But due to the pandemic, some essential parts have taken nearly three times longer to arrive. While Laowattana hoped to have the robots in eight more hospitals by the end of the month, such sourcing issues mean they may have to wait even longer.</p>



<p>For now, Thailand has successfully contained the virus. As far as his robots go, Laowattana sees their role expanding to treating other infectious patients, like those suffering from tuberculosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two decades ago, Laowattana was considered a fringe scientist by his peers. But the pandemic has been a bittersweet validation of his life’s work. “I used to tell people that automation will happen over the next five years,” he said, “but today I tell people, it needs to happen now.”</p>

<p>☀️Sunblock stock (SUN) makes 10% in sunny year. Loses 2% in rainy year.</p>
<p>☂️Umbrella stock (RAIN) loses 2% in sunny year. Makes 2% in rainy year.</p>
<p><strong>Assume:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The year is 50% to be sunny.</li>
<li>The risk free rate is 0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A few things to think about:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SUN has a higher expected return and Sharpe than RAIN</li>
<li>We can see the stocks have -1 correlation</li>
<li>There is an arbitrage. You can put 50% into each stock and earn 4% in sunny years and 0% in rainy years for an EV of +2% on the portfolio</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>What can we expect?</strong></p>
<p>The market prices of these stocks will adjust to there is no arb.</p>
<p>Let’s keep it simple and presume:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;SUN’s price stays constant so its returns characteristics are unchanged.</li>
<li>RAIN’s price is to be bid up so it returns only 1% in a rainy year and loses 3% in a sunny year. Note that RAIN’s expected value is now -1% per year instead of zero.</li>

</ul>
<h2><strong>When You Don’t Understand The Price You Don’t Understand The Picture</strong></h2>
<p>Price is set by the buyer best equipped to underwrite the risk.</p>
<p>If you weren’t willing to bid RAIN up you can bet SUN would have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

<p>This leads to 2 important warnings.</p>
<p>1. You must diversify</p>
<div dir="auto" data-screenname="KrisAbdelmessih" data-tweet="1282724917167951872">
<p>Financial theory dictates that you do not get paid for diversifiable risks. To be blunt, you are incinerating money if you don’t diversify. The SUN/RAIN example can show how you would expect to lose money in RAIN in isolation because the market is priced assuming you could buy SUN. I cover this idea more in <em><a href="https://www.notion.so/abdelmessih/The-Diversification-Imperative-0ffbc51024104c5e88d76e3866a6d5e7">The Diversification Imperative</a></em>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>2. You might be a tourist</p>
<p>It’s worth asking yourself, does X look overpriced because I have the wrong perspective? You are looking at RAIN but don’t see what the SUN investor sees.</p>
<h3 dir="auto" data-screenname="KrisAbdelmessih" data-tweet="1282724917167951872"><strong>A Market-Maker Example</strong></h3>
<p>If X is willing to pay me a high looking price for a stock or option, what’s the probability they are selling something else to someone else such that they are happy to pay me the “high” price?</p>
<p>Let’s say a call overwriter sees a modest surge in implied vol and is happy to collect some extra premium. Except he’s selling calls to a Citadel market-maker who’s happy to pay the “high” price because her desk is selling index vol. In fact, they are selling index implied correlation at 110%. You might be happy selling the calls for 2% when they are usually worth 1%, but if the person buying them from you knows they are worth 3% at the time you sold them then make no mistake, you are playing a losing game.</p>
<p>However, if your professional edge is in deeply understanding the stock you are selling calls on, then you might be the one capturing the edge in the expensive calls. You are capturing it ultimately from the fact that index volatility is ripping higher and market makers are simply capturing the margin between the weighted option prices of the single stock in proportion to the index volatility. So you, the informed single stock manager, is making edge against the index volatility buyer who set off the chain of events.</p>
<p>The decomposition of the edge between you and the market maker is unclear. But the lesson is you must know where you stand in the pecking order. When a market maker is asked why they are buying Stock A for $100 they respond “because I can sell Stock Z at $110”. There’s always a relative value reason. The more you internalize the SUN/RAIN example and how correlation relates to diversification the more natural this reasoning becomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Another example</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s consider another option relative value trade.&nbsp; If volatility surges in A but not in B and they are tightly correlated let’s look at how 2 different market participants might react.</p>
<p><strong>Naive</strong></p>
<p>The naive investor isn’t aware of what is not monitoring the universe of names. They do not think cross-sectionally. They see a surge in A and decide to sell it. It may or may not work out. It’s a risky trade with commensurate reward potential.</p>
<p><strong>Sophisticated</strong></p>
<p>The sophisticated trader recognizes they can sell A and buy B whose option prices are still stale (perhaps there has been a systematic seller in B who has been price insensitive. Maybe from the same class of investor our friend “naive” came from. They don’t look at the market broadly and realize the thing they are selling is starting to “stick out” as cheap to all the sharps).</p>
<p>Here’s the key: the sophisticated trader will do the same trade as the naive one but by hedging the vol with B, <em>they can do the whole package bigger than if they simply sold A naked.</em></p>
<p>The sophisticated traders are the ones who see lots of flow. They “know where everything is”. While in this example, sophisticated and naive both sold A there will be times when sophisticated is lifting naive’s offer. Sophisticated has sorted the entire market and is optimizing buys and sells cross-sectionally.</p>
<h3><strong>Are you the fish at the table?</strong></h3>
<p>Flow traders and market makers are always wondering if their counterparty is legging a portfolio that they’d like to leg themselves if they saw the whole picture.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s not possible because of structural reasons. For example, the risk that banks exhaust from structured product issuance or facilitating commodity hedges for corporations originates from a relationship nobody else can access.</p>
<p>A bank charter means some captive audiences. But that exhaust risk is recycled through the market much like a good flows through a vertical supply chain from wholesaler to retailer, with a markup being tacked on incrementally until its sold to a Robinhood client.</p>
<p>The markups are not explicitly in dollars but in the currency that lubricates financial markets — risk/reward. Mathematical expectancy, like a house’s edge, is priced by its most efficient holder.</p>
<p>If prices are always being set by the party who most efficiently underwrites/hedges/prices the risk and you know you are not one of those parties then you should wonder…</p>
<p>am I being arbed?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    
    <p>Have you ever thought about how we navigate and perceive the world around us?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn — The Brain Basics</a>, I have described the basic principles of brain functioning. But as powerful as it is, our brain is a black box that relies on various sensory systems to get information from the outside world for processing.</p>
<p>Without input from those sensory channels, we are just a conscious sack of bones, muscles, and organs that wouldn’t know about the existence of anything around us.</p>
<p>But how many senses do we have? To answer that, we have to differentiate between the two main types of stimuli first: external (outside our bodies) and internal (generated by our organism itself). For this article, let’s focus on the external stimuli since that is the only way to get information about our environment. Therefore, those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vision</li>
<li>Hearing</li>
<li>Touch</li>
<li>Taste</li>
<li>Smell</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a sixth external sense (sense of balance, responsible for perceiving gravity and acceleration), but this article will focus on those five only, since the sense of balance represents one’s position in the world, without offering much information about the surroundings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all those senses are pretty localized, except for one. We can only see with our eyes, hear with our ears, smell with our nose, and taste with our mouth. However, we can experience touches (and a range of other sensations like pressure, vibration, temperature) with our skin (and hence, entire body).</p>
<p>Touch was the first sense organisms had to develop to navigate the unfriendly world around them. Like taste, touch aids in analyzing objects in direct contact with the body. Conversely, vision, hearing, and smell have evolved to interpret the world at a distance.</p>
<p>Collectively, all external sensory systems allow humans to navigate and interact with the world around them:</p>
<ul>
<li>we perceive light (a short range of the electromagnetic spectrum) with our eyes;</li>
<li>we perceive sound with our ears;</li>
<li>we perceive chemical substances with our nose and mouth;</li>
<li>we perceive temperature, position, and motion with our skin;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="senses-throughput">Senses Throughput</h2>
<p>All these sensory channels have a capacity for how much information they can carry. Surprisingly, the difference between the throughputs of various channels is striking. In his book, “Presentation Secrets,” Alexei Kapterev defines the throughput capacities as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/unconscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image Of Senses Throughput For Unconscious Attention"></p>
<p>Therefore, we have the following throughput capacities:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>visually</em> we perceive around 10,000,000 bit/sec;</li>
<li>through <em>touch</em> we can perceive around 1,000,000 bit/sec;</li>
<li><em>hearing</em> and <em>smell</em> has 100,000 bit/sec throughput;</li>
<li><em>taste</em> has only 1,000 bit/sec throughput;</li>
</ul>
<p>That is some tremendous difference between various senses. I will not focus on the “bits/sec” unit of measurement since it is not that relevant for now. What is relevant is the capacity relative to each other. We get a massive amount of information through our eyes, a tenth of that through our skin, a hundredth of that through our ears and nose, and a tenth of thousands of that through our mouth.</p>
<p>You might wonder why touch is on the second place and not hearing. It turns out that the chart above represents the <em>unconsccious attention</em> throughput amounts—that is, information we perceive without deliberately paying attention to it. What about the <em>conscious attention</em> throughput amounts? Kapterev covers that as well:</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/conscious_attention_bit_sec.png#c" alt="Image Of Senses Throughput For Conscious Attention"></p>
<p>The conscious senses throughput is incredibly small in comparison with the unconscious ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>vision</em> has still the highest capacity of 40 bit/sec;</li>
<li><em>hearing</em> took over touch with 30 bit/sec on the second place;</li>
<li><em>touch</em> has 5 bit/sec throughput;</li>
<li><em>smell</em> and <em>taste</em> both have only 1 bit/sec;</li>
</ul>
<p>Kapterev’s work is based on Danish scientist Tor Nørretranders, who in 1991 defined the <em>Bandwidth of Senses</em> in his book “The user illusion: Cutting consciousness down to size.” Although there is still no precise measurement of conscious throughput (29 years have passed since Nørretranders’ attempted to measure it), more recent findings (2013), display a similar trend regarding the conscious capacity. For instance, Richard Epworth defines conscious throughput depending on the task at hand (operating on and memorizing different things), and it can vary between 2–18 bit/sec:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<figure>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Therefore, if we consciously perceive so little, what happens with all that information we sense unconsciously? That is a fascinating question that scientists are trying to understand fully. Some of that information is still processed unconsciously by different regions of the brain for threats and extraction of relevant features. I will cover more of it in one of the next posts on attention.</p>
<h2 id="brains-virtual-reality">Brain’s Virtual Reality</h2>
<p>Since we consciously are able to perceive so little information, we have to interpret a lot of things and greatly rely on our previous experiences when interacting with the world around us. As much as we would like to experience reality as objective as possible, we are living inside our heads much more than we think.</p>
<p>What we experience as The World is nothing but a recreated representation of the actual world in our minds based on what we know about it already. You might be sitting or lying on the couch when you read this, and it would be effortless for you to go to the kitchen with your eyes closed. You would probably even not have to slow down, because you have a model of your house/flat in your mind already. Another example is your commute to work: if you have your car, you know the path, and you just drive to your work, listening to your favorite songs, and singing along. Or, if you have to use public transport, you are probably reading or listening to something while on your way to the workplace.</p>
<p>But things change drastically when you don’t have any prior experience of something. Imagine you are driving in a new big city and you need to find your Airbnb flat in the city center. Because your conscious throughput is small, you have to “shut down” any irrelevant sensory channels: you do not eat while driving, turn off the music, and might not be talkative. All your attention is directed on the road, semaphores, signs, and other cars. Even then, you might occasionally take the wrong turn because you were distracted or had to take more time to process information and decide.</p>
<p>If to consider the walking example—imagine you are in a new city and want to get to a place you’ve long wanted to visit. Not only will you plan your path in advance, but you will have to stop and analyze things at each pace: subway stations, bus stations, number of blocks you’ve walked, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, as powerful as it is, a marvel of biological engineering, the brain compresses and prunes information incredibly well before it reaches our conscious attention. So, to compensate for the small amount of conscious processing, the mind keeps an internal representation of your environment at all times, allowing you to put those tens of bits per second of conscious attention to good use at the cost of relying on that reconstructed (and eventually outdated) representation of the world.</p>

July 20, 2020 | https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2019/features-in-production/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2019/features-in-production/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>An approach to turn website features on/off in production.</p>
      <p>When deploying features or new changes to our websites, we might not want them to be available to all users at once. It would be nice if we could slowly introduce new features to our users. We might even want to completely disable them and have them there in secret. In this article, I'm going to present a few different ways in which you can release features into production, even when they might not be fully complete.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Before we look into the ways in which we can get our features into production, it's useful to think about how we might have typically developed new changes in our website before a release.</p>
      <p>One of the most common ways is to use feature branches in a <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">gitflow scenario</a>, where you would build your new feature, deploy to a test environment and then try and merge those changes with anything else that has changed in the meantime. You'll probably bundle a number of changes together and then release those to production.</p>
      <p>Some of the issues at this stage might be that you've got a tricky merge, you've tested something in isolation and when you bring it all together other issues might arise. You also haven't really trialled those changes with actual users, so those changes may not be desired or there could be problems with how it all works.</p>
      <h2>Benefits and options</h2>
      <p>Therefore, it's probably a good idea to highlight some of the benefits as to why you might want to integrate your new changes sooner rather than later.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your features get into production quicker</li>
        <li>You can get feedback earlier</li>
        <li>You can test things in reduced quantities</li>
        <li>You should end up with a better product</li>
        <li>Your client will be happy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You might have seen reasons like this elsewhere, and that's because they actually run true for agile development and the scrum process, which in turn is a good fit for <a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/">continuous delivery</a>. A notion that your app is always in a deliverable state, since any new changes have been safely integrated somehow.</p>
      <p>On to the ways in which we can enable our changes...</p>
      <h3>App settings</h3>
      <p>One of the easiest ways is to define them in your web.config, application settings somewhere, or provide settings in your Umbraco solution to switch features on and off. You'll need to check this setting within your code before including the new changes for your users.</p>
      <p>This can be done with a feature helper, which can query the app setting and then return a true or false as to whether the new changes should be included or not.</p><pre><code>public static class FeatureHelper
{
    public static bool IsFeatureEnabled(string featureFlag)
    {
        // check if we have enabled functionality via web.config
        bool.TryParse(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get(featureFlag), out var setting);
        return setting;
    }
}</code></pre><p>If you'd like to turn off entire controllers or action methods, one of the ways in which you can do that is via the use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/understanding-action-filters-cs">attributes</a>. These will decorate your actions and apply the filter before any of the other code is run. In the attribute logic, it will call our feature helper to determine whether or not a feature should be applied.</p><pre><code>public class FeatureAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    public string ConfigVariable { get; set; }

    public FeatureAttribute(string configVariable)
    {
        ConfigVariable = configVariable;
    }

    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        // if the feature is not enabled, then redirect to 404
        if (!FeatureHelper.IsFeatureEnabled(ConfigVariable))
        {
            filterContext.HttpContext.Response.Redirect("/404/");
        }
        else
        {
            base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext);
        }
    }
}</code></pre><p>This allows for features to be controlled relatively easy in terms of when it is available, but it's an all or nothing solution which might not be desired when you want to tentatively introduce customers to your new feature.</p>
      <h3>Session</h3>
      <p>We can apply changes based on a user's session data, which could be enabled via a campaign to help with testing. Ask for people to click a link and become part of the session. You can then trigger an update that will kill off any session data if there are issues. The code above that we used for checking app setting can be amended to apply with session data.</p><pre><code>public static class FeatureHelper
{
    public static bool IsFeatureEnabled(string sessionFlag)
    {
        // check if we have a valid session to enable functionality
        var sessionVar = HttpContext.Current?.Session[sessionFlag];
        if (sessionVar == null)
        {
            return false;
        }

        return bool.Parse(sessionVar.ToString());
    }
}</code></pre><p>This is great for ad hoc testing, as everything can return to normal after the session. This is ideal if you don't have an account system set up, but it is helpful if you can target or segment your users if you have a hypothesis you want to test.</p>
      <p>A/B testing would be a good scenario here. One set of users could get the feature enabled and the other set could continue as normal to see if anything is improved, if your feature relates to performance or conversions. It's important that you can define what improvement looks like or can at least get some feedback from your users.</p>
      <h3>User preference</h3>
      <p>If you do have an account section, you could provide the user the choice as to whether they want to opt in to a newly released feature that you might want to test further before enabling for all. You would need to check against the current logged in user as to whether or not they would like to see those changes.</p>
      <p>In Umbraco, you could define this as a member property or <a href="https://our.umbraco.com/Documentation/Getting-Started/Data/Members/#creating-member-groups" data-anchor="#creating-member-groups">membership group</a> so you can see within the backoffice which users have enabled your feature and segment your users that way. If your changes are more granular, then using properties is probably preferred.</p>
      <p><em>Just to note, for members in Umbraco there is the concept of role based access, which is tied with membership groups, so could be an option if you wanted to hook in that way instead. This uses .NET authorisation under the hood.</em></p><figure><img src="https://24days.in/media/2269/umbraco-membership-features.png" alt="umbraco-membership-features.png"></figure><p>This puts the control on to your users, and they are more likely to be actively engaged with a feature and also understand that there may be issues. If they're not happy with how it works, then they can opt back out and carry on as normal. Within your website, you can provide an option for feedback based on whether a new feature has been turned on. They can submit reports and you can gain some quality insight as to how your users are actually using your changes.</p>
      <h3>Deployment slots</h3>
      <p>If you're doing your deployments via Azure App Services, then another option at your dispense, is to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots#route-traffic" data-anchor="#route-traffic">deployment slots</a>. The main use case for this is to run a staging slot alongside your live slot, and to swap them when doing a deployment to ensure that you've tested your changes, warmed up your site beforehand and traffic is switched over without downtime.</p>
      <p>There is another benefit to it though, in that it can allow you to drive traffic to either slot based on a percentage. That way you can test with 20% of users before rolling out to the other 80% and this is managed through deployment. You can do similar with traffic manager or other load balancing rules.</p><figure><img src="https://24days.in/media/2265/deploymentslots-routetraffic.png" alt="deploymentslots-routetraffic.png"></figure><p>With this option, it's even more important that you can provide suitable metrics and logs to determine how your new changes are performing. Without reasonable guidance, you're in the dark as to whether or not it's a good idea to roll out.</p>
      <h3>Features as a service</h3>
      <p>With the rise of microservices, why not make use of a service that can handle our features? One of those services is <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, which provides a dashboard for your features and has a number of libraries (inc. JS and .NET) that you can integrate with. As a solution, it'll allow you to get a full feature management tool pretty quickly, and one that should provide plenty of options albeit at a price. Useful to consider, and there may well be others out there. The concepts should still be the same as we've outlined in this article.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Testing features in production is a big part of continuous improvement and ties in well with the continuous development way of doing things. You can deliver changes quicker and have greater confidence in when a feature is enabled for all. Ideally, you can ramp up usage in a controlled manner.</p>
      <p>You can gain feedback on your changes from real users and scenarios, which may in turn provide much greater insight as to how something works. The end goal being that your changes have been well integrated and are of better quality overall.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve read an article or even some brief description of GraphQL, it probably included a line about what it does better than REST and other APIs. Glancing over the question like that isn’t really fair though is it? You won’t get the whole picture without really looking at each API’s uses and advantages so let’s try to dig a bit into that here.</p>
<h2>GraphQL - the new standard</h2>
<p>GraphQL is a flexible system for requesting data that focuses on pinpoint requests and delivering exactly what is required. What sets GraphQL apart from other APIs is its unique approach, it’s client-driven. Instead of handling it as usual i.e. server to a client, here the client decides how everything is handled. The main benefits are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>adaptability</strong> - the client decides what data they want, how they want it and what format they want to get it in,</li>
<li><strong>efficiency</strong> - delivers exactly what the client requests without over fetching,</li>
<li><strong>flexibility</strong> - GraphQl is cross-platform and supports more than a dozen languages (Perl, Java, Python, PHP among others).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most well-known example of GraphQL application is probably GitHub. They switched to it in 2016 citing scalability and flexibility as the two major reasons. REST simply wasn’t cutting it for them, because it often required multiple requests to get the data you wanted and also over-fetched data on each of those requests. With GitHub’s rapid growth and user base in the tens of millions, you can imagine how big a concern that had to be. GraphQL provided exactly the alternative they needed because it’s focused on the client being able to request particular data in a specific format for a specific use.</p>

<h2>REST - still most popular one (?)</h2>
<p>After voicing some complaints about it it’s only fair to take a look at REST. Even though some question if it’s not outdated it’s still the most commonly used API. REST is a stateless architecture for data transfer. RESTful systems put an emphasis on statelessness and hypermedia. Unlike GraphQL here the concerns of client and server are separated. The usually mentioned advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>performance</strong> - best suited for systems requiring rapid iteration and HTTP standardized verbiage,</li>
<li><strong>scalability</strong> - allows the support of large numbers of components and interactions among them,</li>
<li><strong>simplicity</strong> - REST has a uniform interface which simplifies and decouples the architecture,</li>
<li><strong>modifiability</strong> - components can be modified to fit changing needs even while the application is running.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, REST is still the most popular API. Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Paypal are all using RESTful APIs. REST can tie together a variety of resources that can be requested in a number of ways and in different formats for various purposes. If you need a more general-purpose API than the pinpoint GraphQL this is the one for you.</p>

    </span></p>
<h2>gRPC - performance at all costs</h2>
<p>gRPC is a lightweight and quick system for requesting data, it’s a fresh take on an old method called Remote Procedure Call or RPC. The main difference here is how it defines it’s contract negotiations. REST defines interactions through standardized terms in its requests, GraphQL runs requests against a created schema to fetch exactly what is required. RPC functions on contracts, the negotiation is defined by the relationship between the server and the client not by the architecture. Most of the power relies on the client-side while handling and computations are offloaded to a remote server hosting the resource. To put it short the key advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s lightweight, requires very little resources which makes it a handy solution for even extremely low powered situations</li>
<li>it’s efficient, gPRC uses protobufs, a method of serializing structured data which focuses on serializing communication in an effective manner</li>
<li>it’s open-source and can be freely used, modified or forked</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, gRPC is suited for systems that need a set amount of data or processing routinely and in which the requester is low power or wants to preserve resources. The best examples are immensely popular IoT devices like voice controllers, smart light switches, smoke alarms locks, and cameras. </p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (<a href="https://secalerts.co/article/what-is-cve/1b878c94">CVE</a>) turns 21 this year and, just like any 21-year-old, there have been growing pains along the way. There was even a growth spurt.</p>

<p>In the case of CVE, this happened between 2016 and 2017, when the number of vulnerabilities assigned a <a href="https://secalerts.co/article/what-is-a-cve-id/9a18af10">CVE ID</a> skyrocketed from 6,447 to 14,714.</p>

<p>Why the sudden increase? Let's start at the beginning ...</p>

<p>In September 1999, MITRE Corporation published a paper titled <i><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/docs/docs-2001/Development_of_CVE.html">The Development of a Common Enumeration of Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a></i> i.e. CVE.</p>

<p>"(We are) building a system that can integrate and manage vulnerability information from different sources, such as network assessment tools, intrusion detection systems, and archives, in a database for supporting enterprise security operations," stated MITRE.</p>

<p>MITRE's desire to establish an independent naming authority stemmed from the fact there were already numerous vulnerability databases, all with differing naming protocols. Not surprisingly, this caused confusion among researchers and vendors because, among other things, they were unable to determine if these databases were referring to the same vulnerability.</p>

<p>"The goals of having CVE are to ... assign a standard, unique name to each vulnerability, and exist independently," stated MITRE, also realising that "for CVE to have any impact ... (it) must be openly available to the public, without restrictions on distribution."</p>

<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://secalerts.co/assets/images/article/cve-1999-0001.jpg">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>MITRE recognised that a public vulnerability database might assist hackers but argued the benefits outweighed the risks. In a pre-social media world, one interesting benefit given was: "Community opinion is shifting towards sharing information ...".</p>

<p>When CVE officially came into being (Oct. 1999), it was designed to deal with a maximum of 1,000 vulnerabilities a year. The year after CVE's arrival the number of vulnerabilities exceeded the 1,000 mark - 1,020 - and, as the years progressed, the quantity of software and hardware ... and vulnerabilities ... escalated. By 2005 the number of assigned vulnerabilities was a whisker away from 5,000 (4,935). Dealing with this volume was proving an issue for CVE and it began looking at ways to address the expanding vulnerability landscape.</p>

<p><strong>CANDIDATE NAMING AUTHORITIES</strong></p>

<p>The September 1999 paper identified a Candidate Naming Authority (<a href="https://secalerts.co/article/what-is-a-cna/5f1a3934">CNA</a>) as an entity that could assist identifying and naming vulnerabilities. However, CNAs didn't necessarily speed up the process. This is because between 1999 and 2005 there was a three-step process to naming (assigning) a vulnerability.</p>

<p>First a 'problem' was identified as a candidate - potential vulnerability - and given the prefix CAN e.g. CAN-1999-0345. This step could be done by a CNA, of which there were 23 in 2005. However, for a candidate to become a published vulnerability, the CVE Board had to discuss, review, and vote on whether a candidate was a vulnerability. This had to be done for every candidate. If the Board agreed, a candidate was given CVE status and the prefix changed accordingly, so CAN-1999-0345 became CVE-1999-0345. The final step, populating the CVE ID on the master, published list, was also done solely by CVE.</p>

<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://secalerts.co/assets/images/article/image-01-can-image-1200-crop.jpg">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a first step to speeding up the process, in 2005 the board vote was eliminated and all entries were automatically given a CVE ID. However, CNAs could still only identify but not populate the list and the multi-step process system remained in place until 2016, by which time 'all things internet' - and the corresponding amount of software/hardware - had continued to increase dramatically. This was matched by a sharp rise in the number of vulnerabilities, the sheer weight of which had once again slowed the process of assigning CVE IDs, resulting in some researchers not receiving a CVE assignment/s.</p>

<p>This was because, at the time, the CVE program operated to a scope (list) of software types for which it would assign CVEs. This scope was created to focus resources on the most important products and, if a product wasn't within the scope, CVE didn't assign and populate the list.</p>

<p><strong>THE WINDS OF CHANGE</strong></p>

<p>"A recent discussion of problems with the CVE system ... has led some to wonder about its future," wrote <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/679315/">Linux Weekly News</a> on March 9, 2016. "The problems stem from the difficulty, sometimes impossibility, of getting CVEs assigned for real vulnerabilities. That, in turn, has led some to stop even requesting CVE numbers for vulnerabilities that they find, which further reduces their usefulness."</p>

<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://secalerts.co/assets/images/article/cve-woes01.jpg">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It's hard to imagine that this was the state of play less than four years ago. But it was. To the point where the online community was beginning to contemplate alternatives, such as <a href="https://www.openwall.com/ove/">OVE IDs</a> - "unique IDs that you may use to refer to software security vulnerabilities (one ID per vulnerability), much like we use CVE IDs", and the Open Source Vulnerability Database (<a href="https://blog.osvdb.org/">OSVDB</a>) - "OSVDB's goal is to provide accurate and unbiased information about security vulnerabilities in computerized equipment."</p>

<p>Thousands of vulnerabilites were going un-assigned and, therefore, unpatched. Additional change was needed.</p>

<p>On March 21, 2016, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/news/archives/2016/news.html">CVE wrote</a>: "The recent explosion of Internet-enabled devices - known as the Internet of Things - as well as the propagation of software-based functionality in systems has led to a huge increase in the number of CVE requests ... We did not anticipate this rate of growth ... The result has been some of the delay in CVE assignments that the software security community has recently witnessed."</p>

<p>A few months later (June 2016), the Distributed Weakness Filing system (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-dwf-project-vulnerability-reporting-done-open-source-way">DWF</a>) launched. As the name suggests, the DWF distributed the task of assigning CVE IDs and gave control of cataloguing vulnerabilities to, among others, independent experts, software vendors, and academic institutions.</p>

<p>"Rather than having to submit security reports through a single funnel, anyone within the community can work through a more streamlined reporting mechanism and receive a DWF number," said Kurt Seifried, a security researcher at Red Hat, who built and launched the DWF (which lasted nearly three years, <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtseifried/status/1103858442479910913">shutting down</a> in March 2019).</p>

<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://secalerts.co/assets/images/article/kurt---dwf---tweet.jpg">
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While the DWF eased the burden for CVE, it - CVE - already had plans afoot to improve the system in place.</p>

<p>"By the time 2016 came around, CVE was wanting to not only introduce new CNAs, but implement process improvements," said Chris Levendis, the MITRE CVE Project Lead, while speaking with SecAlerts.</p>

<p>One of these improvements was the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna/rules.html#Section_1_1_cnas">new-look CNA program</a>, with CNA now standing for "CVE Numbering Authority".</p>

<p>Whereas 'old' CNAs (Candidate Naming Authorities) could only identify a potential vulnerability - candidate - and name it with the CAN prefix, the new CNAs could do what only CVE had been tasked with doing i.e. assigning CVE IDs. Additionally, CVE did away with scope restrictions on what types of vulnerabilities it would publish.</p>

<p>Participation in the CNA program was (and still is) voluntary and organisations must provide CVE IDs for free. They must also have a "public vulnerability disclosure policy" and a "public source for new vulnerability disclosures." If there are any naming disputes, MITRE is the primary CNA and the "CNA of last resort".</p>

<p><strong>CVE AS WE NOW KNOW IT</strong></p>

<p>Allowing CNAs to assign CVE IDs, and eliminating scope restrictions, worked, and this resulted in the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/browse-by-date.php">growth spurt</a> (6,447 to 14,714) between 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>"Before the introduction of CVE Numbering Authorities in 2016, CVE populated 100% of CVE entries," said Levendis. "Now the ratio is 60-40 in favour of CNAs. CVE continues to modernize the rules and underlying technologies to make it easier for CNAs to publish CVEs and it's intended that, over time, CNAs will populate all entries."</p>

<p>The list of CNAs grows constantly and, as of July 7, 2020, there were <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html">130 organizations</a> - including Google, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Cisco and Red Hat - in 21 countries.</p>

<p>Publishing times for CVEs are typically down to days or even hours. Where there is variability in publishing times, it is more often due to human factors rather than the CVE operational model.</p>

<p>For example, a vulnerability researcher working with a vendor might take time to validate the CVE in order to make sure it is 'legitimate'. Or it could be something even simpler.</p>

<p>"A researcher might collect a CVE ID for a vulnerability but move on to another project before coming back to the vulnerability," says Levendis. "CVE discourages this but it happens."</p>

<p>CVE has come a long way in its relatively short lifetime. From 894 assigned CVE IDs in 1999 to a high (so far) of 16,556 in 2018, CVE, like any 21yo, continues to change with the times.</p>

<p>"CVE isn't just about MITRE," concludes Levendis. "It's a public-private partnership that grows every day."</p>

Are you looking for an easy way to contact people who may be interested in a new service? Then you probably don't want to waste time setting up a  subscription form and email automation to talk to them.</p><p>In this article we'll show you how to create an automated subscription system to test new ideas and quickly contact potential users <strong>in just 5 minutes.</strong> Really.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><p>Example of a Google Forms embed created in 1 min using Google's templates</p><h2>Let's just use Google Forms and keep it simple, shall we?</h2><p>First, I'll take a second to argue that Google Forms is fancy enough for a quick setup.</p><p>When trying out new ideas, what's important comes <strong>after</strong> the subscription form. You need to start talking to your potential users/customers/subscribers, and the faster you get to that part the better.</p><p>I always choose Google Forms to create simple surveys because:</p><ul><li>People are already familiar with them</li><li>It has free templates -and it's easy to create a new form from scratch</li><li>You can embed them in a webpage or share it's link</li><li>Responses get automatically stored in a Google Spreadsheet, which makes for an easy and simple database</li></ul><p>And the most important reason to use it: just to try it. If it works, you saved time and got to talking to users really fast. If it turns out you your users really really hate Gforms, at least it only took you 5 minutes to set it up 🤷‍♀️</p><p>Now let's get to it:</p><h2>Step 1: Create your GForm from a template</h2><p>Like all things easy, GForms has a few templates you can use to try out new ideas. Every time I've used GForms, I've always found a related template I can quickly adapt to my needs.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><h2>Step 2: Set up a responses spreadsheet</h2><p>As soon as you start getting responses, you can click on the spreadsheet button at the top right and create a Google Spreadsheet. Each response will automatically create a new row.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><h2>Step 4: Choose your template and create a sequence</h2><p>There are many templates to choose form, just pick the one that fits what you're trying to do and adapt it to your own needs.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="1" title="1" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/281df4e3efe42ee085efb3b9726a5938/7d769/6.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/281df4e3efe42ee085efb3b9726a5938/5243c/6.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/281df4e3efe42ee085efb3b9726a5938/ab158/6.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/281df4e3efe42ee085efb3b9726a5938/7d769/6.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/281df4e3efe42ee085efb3b9726a5938/e2368/6.png 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Since it's easy, I'd recommend for you to create a sequence to keep your prospects engaged. This is the example I just created:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="1" title="1" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/5da03112179a408f83938e4fe22033ac/0c7b9/7.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/5da03112179a408f83938e4fe22033ac/5243c/7.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/5da03112179a408f83938e4fe22033ac/ab158/7.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/5da03112179a408f83938e4fe22033ac/0c7b9/7.png 657w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>Now you only have to start the task and each new GForm response will trigger the whole sequence.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    



<p>I use obsidian for desktop, IA Writer for mobile, and keep everything in sync with Dropbox.</p>



<p>During college, while I was freelancing, I developed a habit of taking notes. This has served me well since then, and I have tried to manage my notes in more ways than I can remember.</p>

<p>The ones that I can remember trying are: Google Keep, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter notebooks, Aha!, Omni-notes, Notability, Apple notes, Nebo, vim + github, and a bunch of miscellaneous mobile apps.</p>



<p>After finding the solution that works for me, I’ve discovered what my requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Portable format</strong>: I want to be able to load my notes in any system. Potential candidates include docx files, markdown, and pdfs</li>
<li><strong>Access everywhere</strong>: I want to be able to see and read my notes after they’ve been synchronized</li>
<li><strong>Vim mode</strong>: When I’m at a computer, I’d like to be able to use vim mode to modify and update my notes</li>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: I need a good way of associating metadata with my notes like the time the note was taken and a way of linking notes</li>
</ul>

<p>But I also want to be able to use notes for other things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have lots of miscellaneous thoughts during the day and need a way to capture them</li>
<li>I like to keep track of quotes</li>
<li>I often track things like grocery lists</li>
<li>I like to keep track of todo items</li>
</ul>

<p>And it would be nice if the apps that I took my notes on had a dark mode.</p>



<p>I think I may have finally found the solution that works for me, and I want to share my setup just in case it works for other people too. The keystone to my new note-taking strategy is Obsidian. I absolutely love this note-taking app, and whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone. I hope that it continues to be the simple, elegant, and powerful editor that it is today. Disclaimer: I’m not affiliated with them in any way, and don’t have anything to gain by promoting them.</p>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p>When I have used other formats, I always run into corner cases where the note system breaks down. For example, I have always wanted to have my blog posts in the same place as the rest of my notes, but they always seem to get out of sync - I’ll write the original post in one place, and then have to copy it back and forth between systems. This led to my notes and my blog getting out of sync (the blog that you’re reading is my third “real” attempt at getting my blog going).</p>

<p>But markdown has become universal. I can write things in a single format, and load them into any system for viewing. There are a bunch of apps that allow for markdown authoring. I like IA Writer for mobile, and I use Obsidian on all my computers to keep things in sync.</p>

<h2 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h2>

<p>Obsidian gives me a convenient format to put all my day-to-day ramblings, todos, and notes called “Daily Notes”. I have a folder called “Daily Notes”, and each file in this folder is the date of the note (for example, 2020-08-10.md). I also use Obsidian’s Daily Note Template to automatically generate a note with my default format.</p>

<p>Obsidian handles this all for my automatically, but the system is simple, so I can do it manually pretty quickly if I want to, say, plan for the next day while I’m laying in bed.</p>

<h3 id="daily-note-format">Daily Note Format</h3>

<p>My daily notes contain the following sections specified as markdown headings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TODO</strong>: I put all the tasks that I want to get done “today” in this section

<ul>
<li><strong>Stretch</strong>: As things come up during the day, I often put them in this section, and move them to the next day if I don’t get to them</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personal Goals</strong>: I generally have personal objectives that I am actively  working on. This is where I track those objectives, and their output (metrics, notes, links, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Business Goals</strong>: I like to track the ongoing goals at my job separately from my personal goals.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplished</strong>: It’s nice to lay in bed at night and make a list the things that I got done that day</li>
<li><strong>Daily thoughts</strong>: This section is freeform, and is more like my “journaling” section. As I’m wandering through the day, for example, and I have the next billion dollar business idea, solutions to world hunger, or breakthroughs on artificial general intelligence, I’ll add them to this section.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vim-mode">Vim Mode</h2>

<p>Despite how cumbersome it was to constantly have to boot jupyter notebooks, I loved being able to write my notes with a vim mode. I am so much more efficient when I can take note in vim mode. For example, if I’m on a call, I can simply press enter to separaet things in a list, and then make the list when there is a lull in noteworthy conversation by using <code>ctrl+v</code> + move up several lines + <code>shift+i</code> + “-”.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>

<p>I use dropbox to synchronize files across all my devices. My only gripe with Dropbox is that it <em>really</em> wants you to use a folder called “Dropbox”, which is kind of annoying. But it’s available in all places, and it does a good job of synchronization, so it’s fine.</p>

<h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>

<p>The blog that you’re reading right now is generated with markdown files, so I cloned the repository into my dropbox, and now I can modify and write blog posts in the same place that I take my notes! This was a huge win for me.</p>

<p>I’m still looking for a way to automatically deploy my site when I push to master in order to remove the need to run a deploy script (and have the necessary dependencies in place to do so). Netlify looks like it might be a good solution to this problem, but I haven’t set it up yet.</p>

<h2 id="zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</h2>

<p>I didn’t know there was a word for this style of taking notes until it became trendy a few months ago, but I find that prepending notes with dates is extremely useful for cases where I might have had multiple meetings on the same subject, or where I met with the same person multiple times, but do not have a regularly scheduled meeting with them (I put those in dedicated “1x1” notes).</p>



<p>I haven’t figured out a good way to use tags yet. I’ve tried it in the past, and I end up with more tags than I do notes, making the tags less useful than full-text search. Side note: full text search comes for free with markdown because it’s such a simple file format. Most applications can do it, or you can just do a <code>grep</code> if you have a terminal open.</p>

<p>Also, I still haven’t figured out a great way to link notes to each other. Folders do a pretty good job of grouping similar notes, and I haven’t found a compelling use case for linking notes. But it’s nice to have solutions in the tool box in case problems arise.</p>

<p>Over the past year, relay operators have done a good job in diversifying the range of network that they use to host their relays. The problem is that the move away from popular ASNs has not always translated to a move away from popular countries.</p>
<p>This is where we come to Germany, which has the highest amount of Tor relay capacity in the World at 167Gbps, in contrast France is in 2nd place with 64.5Gbps of capacity aka more than 100Gbps lower than Germany.</p>

<p>This is the aggressive anti-privacy shit that most people would expect of somewhere like Russia. This might not be what you expect from a country that claims to love the right to privacy and pushed for the GDPR.</p>
<p>In reality, the German government has a double standard when it comes to the right to privacy. They will fully support that right if it's company's violating your privacy (especially, if they are American because protectionism) but in contrast, the German will give itself as many powers as it can to spy on its own citizens and those abroad.</p>
<p>Now you know how the Germans hate privacy, you will almost certainly be asking about alternative locations.</p>
<h2 id="but-tor-is-encrypted">But Tor is encrypted?</h2>
<p>The high number of high-speed relays and exits in Germany mean that it is not too uncommon to get both a German guard and exit. This gives the state an easier time if they want to target someone using traffic correlation attacks.</p>
<p>That also does not take in account the planned German law that will allow authorities to redirect traffic to state-owned servers, to infect users with viruses/Trojans. This is especially a concern for third-world users of Tor who are going to mainly accessing non-HTTPS sites on a computer without the best security.</p>
<h2 id="what-alternatives-are-there-to-germany">What alternatives are there to Germany?</h2>
<p>The current country with the best privacy to cost ratio is Luxembourg, where a 200Mbit can be gotten <a href="https://gcorelabs.com/pricing/hosting/">for 3.25 EUR per month</a>. Or if you have the money than Switzerland would be more ideal but you would not want to waste a Switzerland VPS on a non-exit relay.</p>
<p>Or if you are cheap, you could get a VPS from a country who hates the western spy powers like Russia or Moldova which will still help enhance the security of the Tor network by decreasing the chances that someone's traffic will just travel though one spying block which will make traffic correlation attacks much harder.</p>

<p>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.oist.jp/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) </a>have shed light on the reproductive role of ‘dark matter’ DNA – non-coding DNA sequences that previously seemed to have no function.</p>



<p>Their findings, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16637-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, have revealed that a specific non-coding genomic region is essential for the proper development of the male and female reproductive organs in rice.</p>



<p>“Rice is one of the major global crops and is the staple food in many countries, including Japan,” said Dr. <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/stg/reina-komiya-phd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reina Komiya</a>, senior author of the research paper and associate researcher from the OIST&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.oist.jp/stg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science and Technology Group</a>. “Further research into how these genomic regions affect plant reproduction could potentially lead to increased productivity and more stable yields of rice.”</p>



<p>Many previous developmental studies have focused on genes – the sections of DNA that provide instructions for making proteins. But in complex creatures like plants and animals, a large fraction of the genome – typically between 90-98% – doesn’t actually code for proteins.</p>



<p>The vast expanse of this ‘junk DNA’ has long puzzled biologists, with many dubbing it the ‘dark matter’ of the genome. But recent research suggests that many of these non-coding genomic regions may have a function after all, giving rise to non-coding RNA.</p>



<p>Scientists have now identified numerous types of non-coding RNA, ranging from small molecules only 20-30 nucleotide bases in length to long molecules of over 200 nucleotides. Although studies show that non-coding RNA plays a vital role in the regulation of gene expression – the process where a gene’s instructions are used to make RNA or protein – the precise function of each specific non-coding RNA remains poorly understood.</p>



<p>Dr. <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/stg/reina-komiya-phd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Komiya</a> is particularly interested in reproduction-specific RNAs. “These are non-coding RNAs that are produced as the reproductive system forms. I wanted to uncover what role they play in the development of stamens and pistils, the male and female reproductive organs in plants.”</p>



<h2><strong>Making mutants</strong></h2>



<p>In the study, Dr. <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/stg/reina-komiya-phd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Komiya</a>’s group focused on a reproduction-specific microRNA – a major class of small non-coding RNAs – called microRNA2118.</p>



<p>The scientists created mutant rice strains by deleting a region of the genome that contains multiple copies of the specific DNA sequence that gives rise to microRNA2118. They found that the mutant strains were sterile and showed abnormalities in the structure of the stamens and pistils.</p>



<p>The stamens in mutant strains contain anthers – the part of the stamen that houses pollen – that are shorter and more curled than in wildtype strains.</p>



<p>“This means that the role of microRNA2118 in the proper development of the stamens and pistils is essential for plant fertility,” said Dr. Komiya.</p>



<h2><strong>Revealing RNA and probing proteins</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;In order to delve deeper into how microRNA2118 controlled development of the anther, the scientists then identified which other molecules were affected by microRNA2118.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://globalplantcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200619-abnormalities-pistils_0.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://globalplantcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200619-abnormalities-pistils_0.jpg 353w, https://globalplantcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200619-abnormalities-pistils_0-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px"><figcaption>The pistils in mutant strains contain a higher number of stigmas – the part of the pistil that collects pollen – than in wildtype strains. Yellow bars indicate 1mm.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>They found that microRNA2118 triggered the cleavage of long non-coding RNA, producing many tiny RNA molecules, called secondary small RNAs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Abnormalities in stamens" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/429873138?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1080" height="608" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“Interestingly, these small RNAs were rich in uracil, one of the four nucleotide bases found in RNA, which is very unusual compared to other small RNAs,” said Dr. <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/stg/reina-komiya-phd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Komiya</a>. “We hope to find out the exact function of these small RNAs – and whether this difference in nucleotide composition is important – in further research.”</p>



<p>The scientists also discovered that two Argonaute proteins that were only produced in the stamen were dependent on the presence of microRNA2118. Previous research has shown that Argonaute proteins team up with small RNAs to carry out many regulatory functions, such as silencing genes and cleaving RNA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/stg/reina-komiya-phd" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Komiya</a>’s group therefore proposes that the Argonaute proteins may interact with microRNA2118 to trigger production of the secondary small RNAs. The proteins may also interact with the secondary small RNAs to silence specific regions of the genome. The team hopes to elucidate exactly how the Argonaute proteins and secondary small RNAs affect development of the plant reproductive system in further research.</p>

These secondary small RNAs then may interact with Argonaute to regulate development of reproductive organs.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Reproduction is an important phenomenon of passing genetic information to the next generation and is essential for maintaining a stable yield supply. However, development of the reproductive system is complicated, and many aspects remain unknown,” concluded Dr. Komiya. “This study shows that non-coding RNAs, derived from regions of the genome that were thought to be non-functional, are vital for plant reproduction. Exploring non-coding RNAs further is an exciting and important area of research.”</p>

<![CDATA[Twitter Got Hacked, Is Mastodon Immune?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unless you've been hiding under a rock the last week or so, you probably know that Twitter got “hacked”. So, is Mastodon immune from having the same thing happen to it?</p>

<p>Before we can determine if Mastodon is in any better place than Twitter, we have to understand how Twitter's “hack” occurred.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-says-hackers-got-access-to-internal-tools-for-hijacking-spree/" rel="nofollow">CNET Reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools</p></blockquote>

<p>Social engineering is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)" rel="nofollow">defined</a> as, “The psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.”</p>

<p>I would argue, and I'm sure most people would agree with me, that no one is perfectly immune from social engineering. It's part of being human, and as long as humans are involved in the situation, it's going to be a vulnerability.</p>

<p>I would also argue Mastodon's distributed nature makes such a coordinated and far reaching attack much less likely.</p>

<p>The attackers in this case targeted high profile individuals, and gained access to Twitter's own internal tools using social engineering. Obviously Mastodon has it's own internal tools, but those tools on <a href="https://mastodon.social/" rel="nofollow">mastodon.social</a> have absolutely no effect on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/" rel="nofollow">Fosstodon</a>, and vise versa.</p>

<p>If attackers wanted to coordinate a similar attack on Mastodon, they'd have to stick to individuals on a particular instance, or they'd have to socially engineer moderators/administrators on multiple instances.</p>

<p>No, this isn't an impossible task. After all, more than one individual was compromised in the Twitter hack. I do think it's more difficult though.</p>

<p>Twitter's response to this whole mess is also worth taking a look at. When Twitter discovered the “hack”, they immediately locked out all access to verified Twitter accounts. This caused a whole lot of problems for a whole lot of people, but I'm not going to talk about this now.</p>

<p>If Mastodon were to be “hacked” in the same way, the same outcome would not occur. Just because one instance of Mastodon is compromised does not mean that they all are. If one instance has to lock down accounts to reduce risk, the rest can continue to operate as they always have.</p>

<p>For the time being, Mastodon remains a small enough presence in the social media sphere that this kind of attack hasn't been worth the time. It is growing, and in time it very well may grow to a point where it is. While Mastodon isn't entirely immune to this kind of attack, it is more difficult and less rewarding. That makes is less of a target, even if all other things are equal.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> is a Zilog Z80 netlist-level simulator capable of running Z80 machine code and also an educational tool with features that help reverse engineer and understand this chip better.</p>
<p>Z80 Explorer is a tool I wished I had a few years ago when I first started looking at the photos of Z80 chip die and was learning to reverse-engineer its <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/anatomy-z80-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a>. The process was slow and painful as it involved deciphering the faint image traces into logic gates and functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes later, I’ve found that the Visual6502 team have done a wonderful work with mapping the cpu’s traces into bitmaps representing various layers. Their online viewing <a href="http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert-z80.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tool </a>is impressive and one can learn a lot from using it, but as most online tools, it has limitations which I quickly hit when trying to understand the chip behavior in more depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I kept playing with the online tool, my wish list of additional features steadily grew. I would have wanted it not only to be a fully functional and a fast simulator but also to provide more elaborate ways to gain deeper insights into the chip's internal behavior, while also being educational, easy, and intuitive to use.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and with the help of repeated COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, I have written this tool to be the way I originally imagined it.</p>
<figure><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-app.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-app.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>Z80 Explorer (click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this blog, I will give an overview of <em>Z80 Explorer</em>'s capabilities and show a couple of useful features which might be easy to miss even after reading the documentation. This blog may change periodically along with the tool itself as I am actively developing it at the moment (Summer 2020).</p>
<p>The tool's user’s guide is a separate online document located here <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/Z80ExplorerGuide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://baltazarstudios.com/Z80ExplorerGuide</a> It is very concise; if something is still unclear, please email me and I will expand on it.</p>
<p>The tool is written to load and use the Z80 dataset (layer images and netlist). It should be able to accommodate other NMOS chips with minimal changes. However, at this time I haven't done any other ports yet as I was solely focused on Z80. The chip's data (resources) are kept separate from the application and can be independently downloaded and updated from a shared <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/gdevic/Z80Explorer_Z80" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github repo</a>. In particular, as the functions of various nets is understood and nets and buses get named, the list of the net names, tips and annotations can grow and be shared.</p>
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> is capable of running native Z80 code at the netlist level. That means, as the instruction opcodes are fed to its pins, the binary 1s and 0s propagate through its internal nets of transistor gates and perform the function identical to what the silicon gates would do on a real chip.</p>
<p>The engine that runs it is quite fast: On my 4GHz i7-4790K CPU, I am able to run Z80 code at around 2.3kHz which is (only!) around 2000 times slower from the speed it would have run on the real silicon. At those “speeds”, it is not inconceivable to run some of the standard CPU diagnostic programs - so I did just that: I run a well known ZEXALL diagnostic program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That program normally takes hours even on a real Z80. </p>
<p>After a few days of running within the simulator, the list of passing tests kept growing. At one point, after a week or so, the simulator’s internal cycle counter overflowed its 32-bit variable and the simulation stopped. I simply had to resume it, with no need to reset it and with no loss to the accumulated progress.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-zexall.png" alt=""><figcaption>Z80 Explorer running ZEXALL diagnostic</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I have added that version of ZEXALL to the app resources. It is modified from the original in that I had sorted the tests by how long they run: with the quickest going first, it does not take too long before you start seeing some results, assuring you that it is indeed running well.</p>
<p><em>Z80 Explorer</em> has "Image views" where it shows various versions of chip images. Some of them are unmodified resource files shown as layers (diffusion, metal layer etc.), and some are created as combinations of those: vss.vcc.nets.col is a layer with the nets colored such that ground is shown as green, vcc red, and the rest of the nets are colored according to user filters.</p>
<p>You can view different layers and create combinations of them if you hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on layer buttons, or press a key assigned to each layer while holding down the Ctrl key.</p>
<p>The chip/layer view can also be annotated. The application loads a default annotation file (containing those annotations) when it starts, but you can load any other annotation file by dragging that file and dropping it into the application image view. For example, “annot_internals.json” (located in the resource folder) contains a different set of annotations focused more on the internal features. Annotations are adaptive so that they will show and hide as you zoom in and out. They also can contain "macros", which are tokens that expand into named net's and bus' values, and those are updated in real time, as the simulation runs.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Dynamic annotations showing U and V bus values (~ means "inverted")</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In my older article <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://baltazarstudios.com/z80-instruction-register-deciphered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> I looked at the Instruction Register. The signal that enables loading it is a complementary WE (Write Enable) pair of control traces.</p>
<p>Can we find exactly at what time(s) the write enable, now called, "load_ir", is asserted? What is the internal logic equation that governs this control signal?</p>
<p>Using the <em>Z80 Explorer</em>'s "Find" option to search for "load_ir" signal name, and then asking for the schematic of that net, brings up this view:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Schematic view for "load_ir" net</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Hence, the signal is generated by OR'ing net 255 with a latch. Let's follow net 255 which is a NAND gate of clock (hence, a clock gating) with the net 1329. Selecting (double-clicking on) 1329 and asking for the schematic brings us even closer to what we expected to see:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1329.png" alt=""><figcaption>Schematic view for net 1329</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Therefore, the net 1329 is a clock-gated, NAND-combined signal, active when M3, T3 and PLA22 are active. PLA22 represents "IX/IY+CB" instruction extension decode. (The description of PLA22 is held in the application "tips" file as are descriptions of all other PLA entries and some other important nets).</p>
<p>Back to the latch 244 - and this part may not too obvious unless you have some experience looking at the chip traces - the net 244 is at the bottom and the latch set and reset signals are at the top, both clock-gated:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-244.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch at the net 244</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Asking for the schematic of the net 1306 (the one connected from the top-left), which also acts as the latch reset:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1306.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch 244 reset</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>we see that the latch will reset on the "internal reset" or a T3 cycle. The latch will be set on an M1 and T2 cycle edge (so it will show at M1/T3):</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-1307.png" alt=""><figcaption>Latch 244 set</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We can verify what we've found by running a hand-crafted test code. I used a template test program "test_blank.asm" to code in a couple of instructions, one of them using IX register, and then I run it for a couple of cycles. In a Waveform view window the result shows how the load_ir signal is being asserted at every M1/T3 as well as at M3/T3, when the instruction is using the IX/IY prefix (PLA22 active).</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-wave.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/z80explorer-load-ir-wave.png" alt=""></a><figcaption>Waveform diagram showing "load_ir" signal (click to enlarge)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Next, load the "annot_internals.json" file by dropping it onto on the application's image view (the main pane).</p>
<p>You can zoom into the area where are all M and T latches located by pasting this command into the Command Window:&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>img.setZoom(0.98); img.setPos(1151,901)</code></p>
<p>On the startup, the app will try to detect latches, and it will detect most of them automatically. For those not detected, you can add them as you find them. The easiest way to find latches is by using the “Driven by” option. After selecting a net and following its signal chain, if you see two nets being driven by each other in a co-dependent loop, you have found a latch that consists of those two nets (they also act as inverters). One of the app's initialization files, "latches.ini" contains definitions of additional latches. You can add to that file as you find latches that the app did not detect.</p>
<p>Schematic view uses an expanded version of such “Driven by” algorithm to build a tree of gates that contribute to the selected net.</p>
<p>Going the other way, the “Driving nets” option assists you to trace an input net as it branches into the network. For example, pick the /RESET input pad and iterate “Driving nets”, following the highlighted lines. Soon, you should reach a “dead end”, with the nets which apparently nothing is driving, here:</p>
<p><code>img.setZoom(2.926); img.setPos(338,606); img.show(294,548,80,101)</code></p>
<p>About these commands: In order to create these zoom and position commands yourself, set up a desired view and then type “img.state()” in the Command window. The required lines will be printed in the Application Log window.</p>
<p>To obtain the coordinates used in the img.show() command, right-click and select an area you wanted to highlight, and then simply read the coordinates from the Log window and paste them into img.show() as arguments.</p>
<p>The particular network mentioned above contains reset input flops and latches. One of the control signals coming out of it is “int_reset”, or internal reset:</p>
<p><code>img.find("int_reset")</code></p>
<p>This signal branches off to different parts of the chip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every chip normally has several signals that are propagated across its die to literally every corner. Some of those networks are power, ground, reset and the clocking network. (Newer chips implement various “gating” to parts of the design to limit the power consumption, but Z80 does not do such thing.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already mention the Waveform view. This view should be familiar to anyone who has worked with simulation tools like ModelSim; but even for the rest, it should still be very simple and intuitive to use.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://baltazarstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Waveform view can display signals in a variety of formats</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The important thing to remember is to “name” the net that you wish to observe, if it hasn't been named yet, before you can add it to the waveform view. Double click on the net and select “Edit net name...”. You can type any name; a …</p></div></div>

        <p>Time and time again I come across fantastic blogs that I want to subscribe to but can’t find a feed for. First I try putting the site into my RSS reader (<a href="https://miniflux.app/" title="Miniflux website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miniflux</a> is my tool of choice) but it often can’t find anything. Then I search around the site for the little RSS icon or a link but come up blank. As a last resort I start sticking common paths on the domain and with some luck I might finally find a feed on <code>/feed.xml</code> or <code>/rss/</code>. RSS feeds <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22497184" title="Hacker News thread on whether RSS is dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t dead</a>, there isn’t a reason for it to be this hard.</p>
<p>I understand publishing feed links might not fit some website designs and isn’t something I’m going to suggest everyone goes out and fixes.</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> think is fair is websites properly publishing their feeds so my feed reader <em>can</em> find them automatically. Most modern CMS’ do this properly but with the rise of people writing their own themes from scratch properly linking them often gets left by the wayside.</p>
<p>All they need to do is add <code>link</code> elements in their <code>head</code> section like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"alternate"</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"/index.xml"</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>"application/rss+xml"</span> <span>title</span><span>=</span><span>"James Loh feed"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Thats it. My RSS reader now picks up the feed and title set and I can subscribe in one click via Miniflux’s bookmarklet.</p>
<p>Please, don’t forget to add your feeds properly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><span>I don’t know how many times I’ve started, stopped, and deleted trying to write something up on my trip to the Fukushima Hard-To-Return-To Area, AKA the Futaba District of the Fukushima Prefecture. Unfortunately, thanks to COVID-19, I have plenty of time to write this up now. I want to give thanks at the outset to my friend Robyn, the Hollywood photographer who I went with to Chernobyl, who came on this trip too and can view her gorgeous work <span><a href="https://www.vonswank.com/Curiosities-/JAPAN:-FUKUSHIMA/thumbs">here</a><span>, some of which I’ve used in this post</span></span>. I also want to give high fives to Jen Miller for inspiring me to see if I could make this visit even happen when we went to see sumo and to Brian Wanamaker who’s translation skills allowed the serendipitous, sake-filled meeting with Kae to be an inspiration. And, lastly, thanks to everyone who purchased a <span><a href="https://shop.funraniumlabs.com/products.php?product=The-Coffee-Wave-750ml">“Coffee Wave” BBotE</a></span> bottle for making sure we had the cash on hand to have ADVENTURES!</span></p>
<p><span>From the top, I’m not gonna discuss the ongoing work at Fukushima Daiichi. Plenty of ink and electrons already spent on TEPCO and JAEA doing what they can there. We can hope for a TV show that summarizes the events at the power plant as the Tōhoku quake and tsunami struck as well as HBO’s Chernobyl did. My quibbles with that show are minor at best. My favorite thing about it was people coming to me saying “Phil, I think they got something wrong on Chernobyl” and my grin of evil delight when I got to tell them that <a href="https://twitter.com/clmazin">Craig Mazin</a> lovingly captured period authentic Soviet bullshit and presented it faithfully. But I digress, because what is more interesting to me is the efforts to decontaminate, rehabilitate, and re-inhabit the abandoned area around the power plant. The example of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the “settlers”, who are mostly pensioners left in the lurch by the Soviet collapse, gives one path. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s not what Japan did/is doing. But let me say this right now, because belaboring this is what caused me to abort so many previous versions of this post:</span></p>
<h4><span>These towns aren’t coming back. Not because they’re doing a bad job at cleanup. On the contrary, they’re doing an amazing job and are <em><strong>WAY </strong></em>more thorough than the Soviet Liquidators ever were. That is my professional opinion. Unlike Pripyat, a young nuclear boomtown for high fliers, the rural communities around Fukushima Daiichi were already fading away. The quake and tsunami just accelerated the pace.</span></h4>
<p><span>There. I said it. Now maybe I can explain why without tripping over myself.</span></p>
<p><span>This tale starts eight years ago, on March 11, when my career took a dramatic shift when some tectonic plates moved too. If you search for “UC Berkeley radiation specialist” this is very close to my and a former coworker’s job title. We both lost <em>month</em>s of work responding to a fire hose of phone calls, emails, and even faxes as the entire Pacific Rim turned to us as because The Algorithm™ <em>clearly</em> indicated we were the experts on what to do in when a reactor accident happened. More often than not, we had to refer everyone to the public affairs office who promptly turned around and asked us what they should say. This is the price of being professional staff and not tenured faculty; we don’t have the freedom of expression that comes with tenure, we’re just employees. I would like to note that this doesn’t necessarily mean the tenured faculty knew anything about what they were commenting on, but they do have the freedom to spout off to their heart’s content to any microphone and camera that came near. I actually went back to read <span><a href="http://www.funraniumlabs.com/2011/03/post-tsunami-japanese-reactor-problems/">the post I made two days after the quake</a></span> and was quite surprised to see how well I covered things.</span></p>
<p><span>For everyone that has now seen the Chernobyl miniseries on HBO and has that vision in their head for Fukushima Daiichi, you missed the big differences: there was no graphite fire and, holy crap, that was a hell of a quake and tsunami. For everyone now coming to grips with the idea of a double hit of pandemic and then economic collapse with COVID-19, try the <em>triple</em> disaster of one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, a huge tsunami, and then slap a nuclear reactor accident on top of that. On a positive note, at least this triple disaster was relatively local in scope. The contamination around the Futaba District is due to the fuel rods leaking some fission products and a bunch of contaminated/activated sea water from the tsunami plus the cooling water of last resort pumping into the spent fuel pools without filtration (much less deionization) first. There were thousands of tons of graphite that lit on fire and exploded at Chernobyl, lofting a totally different set of radioactive materials across the world. Don’t get me wrong, we could detect Fukushima drifting on the breeze across the Pacific within 48hrs but the isotopic mix and quantity was <em>very</em> different than Chernobyl’s. And, as always, the drum I beat constantly for public education: there is a world of difference between “detectable” and “dangerous”.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>We were met at the train station by Shuzo in a prefectural government van. He made sure that the ID we’d brought with us matched what I’d supplied to him a few months earlier because and, I quote, “It would be very embarrassing if it did not as I wrote the security procedures.” A little later as we drove past a cultural festival and Shuzo gave an embarrassed chuckle as he said he should probably drive a little bit faster in case some of his people working the fairgrounds saw the van. I asked him how many people worked for him in his office. He replied with some uncertainty “”Four…five hundred? Plus contractors, of course.” I slowly turned my head as realized I wasn’t talking to someone in a roughly similar position to me back in the states, but rather an agency head that reported directly to the governor… and he had volunteered himself as a driver and guide because this project is so important to him. Some recalibration of the honor that was being done for us happened in my head then and there.</span></p>
<p><span>Shuzo has a dream to get his hometown back. As a “hometown boy done good” he isn’t just any prefectural official, he had to order his own family out of their homes and off their farms. He evacuated the JAEA office during the emergency. What he wants more than anything is for the communities to come back after the quake/tsunami/nuclear accident triple disaster. And, yes, you should always look at this is in that order of severity; the reactors were the least of the three but it has the consequences everyone is afraid of. The people most afraid of the quake and tsunami are, well, dead. As part of the TEPCO/JAEA remediation plan, as the Japanese government made a commitment that Futaba would not be abandoned like the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and had learned some lessons from that; all of the local towns and farms were offered a settlement to turn everything over for decontamination and/or demolition. Shuzo’s job is to make that happen. He is quite literally in charge of everything that is outside of the power plant decontamination project. The first place he wanted to take us was to his father’s farm.</span></p>
<p><span>I helpfully already did some work of sharing an introduction to my hosts in 2018 when I first started writing this up. From that <span><a href="http://www.funraniumlabs.com/2018/10/fukushima-exclusion-zone-preview-announcements/">post</a></span>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>First off, let me introduce you to Shuzo Sakai, Karin Taira and their project, <span><a href="https://real-fukushima.com/">Real Fukushima</a></span>. Unlike the Chernobyl tours of varying quality done by various independent operators, this is a Fukushima Prefecture government project to show the work done for decontamination and rehabitation of the towns in the Fukushima Exclusion Zone. Karin runs the prefecturally sponsored B&amp;B in Odaka called <span><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1022396-d12926635-Reviews-The_Lantern_House-Minamisoma_Fukushima_Prefecture_Tohoku.html">Lantern House</a></span> which I highly recommend if you have the time to stay overnight (sadly, I did not). Shuzo is a prefectural government official who grew up in a town that is now in the exclusion zone and he’s become head of the redevelopment agency. When you are the boss, you’re allowed to give yourself any extra tasks you want; the one he has chosen for his extracurricular activities is showing people the work done to rebuild and reoccupy. Only foreigners at the moment because, and I quote, “I feel foreigners have less radiophobia than the Japanese.” While I didn’t laugh out loud at this, I did tell him that if this was actually the case that my day job would be much easier. As a local boy done good, Shuzo’s desire is to see the people in the towns he’s always known and loved come home. He would also like people all over the world to see their hometowns in his. That you might remember to give your loved ones a call now and then, maybe go home and visit. They miss you, you know. :)</span></p>
<p><span>Shuzo is the person that wrote the procedures for entry into the Fukushima Exclusion Zone. Shuzo is the person who is ultimately responsible for the decon, demolition and reconstruction of all the towns in the Exclusion Zone. This is personal to him.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span>Among the people that had to be evacuated were Shuzo’s parents. Shuzo isn’t the eldest son, so his brother’s family ended up taking them in. And then when the evacuation area was expanded, all of them got evacuated again together. This was a bit too much stress on his mother and she passed away. For the next several years, his father lived with his brother’s family even after dad’s home and farm were decontaminated because they didn’t necessarily trust dad to live on his own. At 82, he’d literally never done laundry or really cooked a meal in his life so they needed to teach him some basic survival skills before they could let him go back home to live alone. His father’s farm is a good demonstration piece to show the success of decon allowing reoccupation, but also it’s limitation. The house, driveway, sheds, and yard had no detectable radiation above background, but you didn’t have to walk far into the trees at the edge of the property for the count rate to rise a bit. This is a reflection of the phased approach to decontamination: homes/cities, then farms, …</span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Disclaimer: This article is based on a multitude of conversations with mainly bioinformaticians that have many years of experience in working with and in academics, biotech, CROs/pharma companies. This post sums up these shared experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span>The bioinformatics industry is relatively young. Well, at least immature, so it seems. It has been around for a while and there was for sure</span><a href="http://madhadron.com/posts/2012-03-26-a-farewell-to-bioinformatics.html"><span> a lot to complain about 8 years ago</span></a><span>. Now, 8 years later, it continues growing but has it really changed?</span></p><p><span>Let’s quickly recap with how I got here: Last year we started evaluating potential business cases. The one that hooked me the most was the idea to offer DNA- and RNA-sequencing analysis as SaaS. We’d not only offer variant calling and gene expression but also a machine learning optimised approach for alternative splicing, which is much more error prone these days. Thus, I dived into bioinformatics by starting to talk to potential clients, experts, investors, work-horses and used every second of my spare-time to learn about genomics and transcriptomics.</span></p><p><span>Eventually the team split into research-oriented and business-oriented, and while we continued researching the market in search for a use-case for a SaaS opportunity, our research-oriented counterparts started a consulting business. Their projects cover a wide range of cases, from single cell organisms to humans, from basic research to clinical. But as is often the case for consultancy, their work is not scalable, and their feedback clearly shows some yet existing challenges in the industry of bioinformatics. In the meantime, we continued researching the market and having lengthy conversations with bioinformaticians (big shout out to the </span><a href="http://www.independentdatalab.com/"><span>Independent Data Lab</span></a><span>) and potential clients over the last year. Here is my quick observation of what is (still) going on.</span></p><h2><strong>Poor Programming Paradigms</strong></h2><p><span>Despite a fast-growing bioinformatic ecosystem the software quality remains surprisingly low. One key reason for this is that the tools are often developed and maintained by a single person. For example, Nextflow, which is one of the most popular workflow management systems in Bioinformatics, <a href="https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/graphs/contributors" title="Nextflow Code Contributors" rel="nofollow">has about 90% of its code contributed by a single developer</a></span><span>. STAR aligner, which is one of the most popular aligners for RNA-seq data, as well has been </span><a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/graphs/contributors" title="STAR Aligner Code Contributors" rel="nofollow">primarily developed by one contributor</a><span>. Not saying that Nextflow or STAR aligner are suffering under bad code quality, but the fact that it is mainly maintained by a single person, is a risk and as a consequence, there is often no quality assurance involved in the process.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The lack of community-driven software development causes new problems. A single developer without greater experience in software engineering, especially without teamwork experience often neglects established code management practices. Most of the tools are missing any continuous integration workflows or use code conventions. Different programming styles (say C++ and R) are getting mixed up so that the maintenance of the code is almost infeasible. These problems are even more pronounced when it comes to development of customized pipelines by each institute, bioinformatics core facility or a lab, where code management is not only neglected but sometimes is avoided altogether.&nbsp; No version control via</span><a href="https://git-scm.com/"> <span>git</span></a><span>, no code sharing via</span><a href="https://github.com/"> <span>GitHub</span></a><span> or</span><a href="https://gitlab.com/"> <span>GitLab</span></a><span>, no branching system like</span><a href="https://www.gitflow.com/"> <span>git flow</span></a><span> (</span><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18188492/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-git-flow-vs-github-flow"><span>which</span></a><a href="https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful"> <span>is</span></a><a href="https://georgestocker.com/2020/03/04/please-stop-recommending-git-flow/"> <span>debatable</span></a><span>) or versioning system a la</span><a href="https://semver.org/"> <span>semver</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Academic Mindset Of Bioinformatics</strong></h2><p><span>One of the primary reasons why it is usually one developer per tool is the academic domination over the field of bioinformatics tools development. Academic labs are not paid to maintain the tool, but rather to develop and publish a new one - maintaining the software will not get you grant money. As a result, a plethora of new bioinformatics tools comes out every day, and the burden for their maintenance usually lays on the shoulders of a student or a post-doc who developed the tool as part of their degree or a project. Academic jobs are short-lived, with contracts for just several years, after which the researcher needs to move forward, often leaving the developed software behind. As a result, the state-of-the-art in bioinformatics changes rapidly, and so do the “standards”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To be fair, we did observe some convergence in best practices within the field of DNA-sequencing due to the wide adaptation of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) in clinical settings, forcing this branch of bioinformatics into more regulated, and hence more reliable state.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Reinvent All The Wheels!</strong></h2><p><span>The path of the individual programmer leads to another inefficiency: developers are building the same bioinformatic analysis pipelines over and over and over again (while no one is looking over their shoulders).With lack of collaborative development experience, many bioinformaticians prefer to re-develop their pipelines rather than try to understand someone else's code. This is a pity. All that time and money could be spent elsewhere.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Code needs to be developed in teams, shared and distributed, algorithms have to be improved, software should be written in faster languages and for optimised memory, CPU and GPU usages. Money should be spent on services instead of overwhelming research facilities with the same tasks over and over again. Speaking of services.</span></p><h2><strong>Neglecting Specialised Service Providers</strong></h2><p><span>Bad news for Software-as-a-Services (SaaS) or Bioinformatics-as-a-Service (BaaS). There are more and more services but they barely make money. The lack of trust into those services is astonishing. Services are not only avoided by clients but also by bioinformaticians themselves. It seems like BaaS is perceived as a threat to bioinformaticians, even though they themselves could save a lot of time using them. While in other industries new businesses are getting stacked together within days with a strong trend towards no-code platforms, bioinformaticians want to do it all by themselves, not recognising that most of these services are offering outstanding human support, proven and flexible/customisable pipelines and affordable prices. This needs to change and it will change. And the sooner the better, as it would create more room for innovation and quality.</span></p><h2><strong>Classic Management-IT-Gap&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>The well-known issue of management-IT gap is also widely present in the field of bioinformatic.</span><span> Most clients have a great knowledge-gap of how easy and fast results can be delivered today, they just go with it, while 90% of the time results should be available within 24 hours (max). Most of the problems have standardized solutions in place. There’s no need to wait 4 weeks for results and getting distracted in the meanwhile by having to start working on the next project already.</span></p><p><span>The main reason yet again, relies on the academic domination of the bioinformatics world. Academics often prioritize money over time - they would rather spend less and wait weeks for the results, than pay and get the result tomorrow. Furthermore, industry is often demonized by academics as evil, only caring for making money and not caring for state-of-the-art and quality, while bioinformatics core facilities offer sequencing services with “free” bioinformatics support. But of course, as we know, only the cheese in the mousetrap is free. The analyses at core facilities are often performed by young PhD students and post-docs in addition to their thesis projects, with the pipelines that they developed and maintain themselves, resulting in weeks of delivery time and poor communication (often xls tables with very little explanation or follow-up).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In contrast, most BaaS offer the results within 24 hours, provide interactive platforms for visualization and results browsing, historic data management, and an extensive follow-up on the results. And yet, the myth of the demonic industry persists, and researchers in need for bioinformatics turn to academic collaboration rather than seeking industrial partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><h3>Clinical Decisions A Made Based On Non-Proofed Analysis Pipelines</h3><p><span>To emphasize the necessity to rethink and invest in the bioinformatic ecosystem, we need to talk about its meanings. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_parallel_sequencing"><span>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)</span></a><span> is becoming widely used not only in basic research, but is now also entering the clinical settings: rare disease diagnostics, personalized medicine in oncology and immuno-oncology, prenatal diagnostics to name a few.

Competition would ensure a run for the best quality, performance and user-experience (especially improving interpretability). As bioinformatics gets closer and closer to actual healthcare and dealing with patients, we’d all benefit from it.</span></p><p>Edits:</p><p>20.

<p>In the last <a href="https://www.2n.pl/blog/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua">article</a>, we saw the basics of creating plugins in Lua using floating windows. Now it's time for a more traditional approach. Let's create a simple plugin that will show us last opened files in handy side navigation. As we focus on learning the interface, we will use vim native oldfiles list for this purpose. It will look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.2n.pl/system/photos/imgs/000/000/011/original/oldfiles.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you didn't read previous <a href="https://www.2n.pl/blog/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua">article</a>, I highly recommend you to do so, because this article expands on the ideas from the last one and is full of new things in comparison.</p>

<h2>Plugin window</h2>

<p>Ok, so we should start by writing a function that will create our first window, where the <code>oldfiles</code> list will be displayed. But first, we will declare three variables in the main scope of our script: <code>buf</code> and <code>win</code> that will contain our navigation window and buffer references and <code>start_win</code> that will remember the position where we opened our navigation. We will be using these often across our plugin functions.</p>
<div><pre><span>-- It's our main starting function. For now we will only creating navigation window here.</span>
<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>oldfiles</span><span>()</span>
  <span>create_win</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>create_win</span><span>()</span>
  <span>-- We save handle to window from which we open the navigation</span>
  <span>start_win</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_win</span><span>()</span>

  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>botright vnew'</span><span>)</span> <span>-- We open a new vertical window at the far right</span>
  <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_win</span><span>()</span> <span>-- We save our navigation window handle...</span>
  <span>buf</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_buf</span><span>()</span> <span>-- ...and it's buffer handle.</span>

  <span>-- We should name our buffer. All buffers in vim must have unique names.</span>
  <span>-- The easiest solution will be adding buffer handle to it</span>
  <span>-- because it is already unique and it's just a number.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_name</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>Oldfiles #'</span> <span>..</span> <span>buf</span><span>)</span>

  <span>-- Now we set some options for our buffer.</span>
  <span>-- nofile prevent mark buffer as modified so we never get warnings about not saved changes.</span>
  <span>-- Also some plugins treat nofile buffers different.</span>
  <span>-- For example coc.nvim don't triggers aoutcompletation for these.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>buftype'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>nofile'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- We do not need swapfile.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>swapfile'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- And we would rather prefer that buffer will be destroyed when hide.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>bufhidden'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>wipe'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- It's not necessary but it is good practice to set custom filetype.</span>
  <span>-- This allows users to create their own autocommand or colorschemes on filetype.</span>
  <span>-- and prevent collisions with other plugins.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>filetype'</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>nvim-oldfile'</span><span>)</span>

  <span>-- For better UX we will turn off line wrap and turn on current line highlight.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>wrap'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>cursorline'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

  <span>set_mappings</span><span>()</span> <span>-- At end we will set mappings for our navigation.</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Drawing function</h2>

<p>Okay, so we have a window, now we need something to display in it. We will use vim <code>oldfiles</code> special variable, which stores paths to previously opened files. We will take as many items from it, as we can display without scrolling, but of course, you can take as many as you want in your script. We will call this function <code>redraw</code> because it can be used to refresh navigation content. File paths might be long, so we will try to make them relative to the working directory.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>redraw</span><span>()</span>
  <span>-- First we allow introduce new changes to buffer. We will block that at end.</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>modifiable'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

  <span>local</span> <span>items_count</span> <span>=</span>  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_get_height</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span> <span>-- get the window height</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

  <span>-- If you using nightly build you can get oldfiles like this</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>oldfiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>v</span><span>.</span><span>oldfiles</span>
  <span>-- In stable version works only that</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>oldfiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_vvar</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>oldfiles'</span><span>)</span>

  <span>-- Now we populate our list with X last items form oldfiles</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>#</span><span>oldfiles</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>oldfiles</span> <span>-</span> <span>items_count</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>do</span>

    <span>-- We use build-in vim function fnamemodify to make path relative</span>
    <span>-- In nightly we can call vim function like that</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>fn</span><span>.</span><span>fnamemodify</span><span>(</span><span>oldfiles</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>],</span> <span>'</span><span>:.'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- and this is stable version:</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_call_function</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>fnamemodify'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>oldfiles</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>],</span> <span>'</span><span>:.'</span><span>})</span>

    <span>-- We iterate form end to start, so we should insert items</span>
    <span>-- at the end of results list to preserve order</span>
    <span>table.insert</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>list</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>-- We apply results to buffer</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_lines</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>list</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-- And turn off editing</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_buf_set_option</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>modifiable'</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We can now update our main function. We will also add some code that prevents opening multiple navigation windows. For this purpose, we can use <code>nvim_win_is_valid</code> which checks if our plugin window already exists.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>oldfiles</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>win</span> <span>and</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>create_win</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>redraw</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Openings files</h2>

<p>We can now look at our oldfiles, but it would be much handier if we can also open them. We will allow users to open files in 5 different ways! In a new tab, in horizontal or vertical splits, in the current window and in preview mode, which will keep the focus on navigation.</p>

<p>Let's start by opening files in the current window. We should prepare for two scenarios:<br>
1. Opening a file in the window from which the user opens navigation.<br>
2. Closing the starting window, when we will create a new one for opening file.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>open</span><span>()</span>
  <span>-- We get path from line which user push enter on</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_line</span><span>()</span>

  <span>-- if the starting window exists</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>-- we move to it</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- and edit chosen file</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>edit '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>-- if there is no starting window we create new from lest side</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>leftabove vsplit '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- and set it as our new starting window</span>
    <span>start_win</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_win</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>-- After opening desired file user no longer need our navigation</span>
<span>-- so we should create function to closing it.</span>
<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>close</span><span>()</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>win</span> <span>and</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_close</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>-- Ok. Now we are ready to making two first opening functions</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>open_and_close</span><span>()</span>
  <span>open</span><span>()</span> <span>-- We open new file</span>
  <span>close</span><span>()</span> <span>-- and close navigation</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>preview</span><span>()</span>
  <span>open</span><span>()</span> <span>-- WE open new file</span>
  <span>-- but in preview instead of closing navigation</span>
  <span>-- we focus back to it</span>
  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div><div><pre><span>-- To making splits we need only one function</span>
<span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>split</span><span>(</span><span>axis</span><span>)</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_line</span><span>()</span>

  <span>-- We still need to handle two scenarios</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_win_is_valid</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_set_current_win</span><span>(</span><span>start_win</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- We pass v in axis argument if we want vertical split</span>
    <span>-- or nothing/empty string otherwise.</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>axis</span> <span>..</span><span>'</span><span>split '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>-- if there is no starting window we make new on left</span>
    <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>leftabove '</span> <span>..</span> <span>axis</span><span>..</span><span>'</span><span>split '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
    <span>-- but in this case we do not need to set new starting window</span>
    <span>-- because splits always close navigation </span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And in the end the simplest opening in new tab.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>open_in_tab</span><span>()</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_get_current_line</span><span>()</span>

  <span>vim</span><span>.</span><span>api</span><span>.</span><span>nvim_command</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>tabnew '</span> <span>..</span> <span>path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>close</span><span>()</span>
<span>end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For everything to work, we need to add the key mappings, export all public functions, and add a command to trigger our navigation.</p>
<div><pre><span>local</span> <span>function</span> <span>set_mappings</span><span>()</span>
  <span>local</span> <span>mappings</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<p>And that's it! Have fun and make grate things!</p>

July 20, 2020 | https://microtica.com/an-outstanding-cloud-automation-experience/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/an-outstanding-cloud-automation-experience/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> has the goal to provide the best cloud automation experience for developers from its very beginnings. We are so happy when we hear a success story, especially from developers who weren’t familiar with cloud automation previously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why we decided to bring to you a series of interviews with our customers that experience the benefits of our solution. They jumped into a whole new world in a matter of days instead of months. </p>



<p>We are calling it: <strong>Developers Say.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The first developer we talked to is Marko, a full-stack developer from <a href="https://vertt.ch/">Vertt</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>You can read more about how Vertt accelerated its DevOps processes with Microtica <a href="https://microtica.com/case-studies/accelerating-devops-processes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</em></p>



<h2><strong>What’s the product you’re developing?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://vertt.ch/">Vertt</a> is a Swiss ride-hailing startup that provides a reliable, responsible and secure transportation experience. As a service, Vertt wants to fill in the voids that exist in the Swiss transportation system. We innovate all the time, in order to provide society with a one-stop mobility solution.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which technologies did you use when developing the solution?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>You could say we actually have <strong>five applications</strong>. Four are mobile-native iOS and Android applications, two for the passenger experience, and two are for the drivers. We also have <strong>one web application </strong>which is the admin panel for our business team, developed in Angular.</p>



<p>As for the backend and infrastructure part, the solution is built on the latest <strong>microservice technology with AWS as a cloud provider</strong>. The backend is developed in Node.js.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFmUaDjB8TNSg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0?e=1599696000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=5D8Bl17XcfwZ91kQIRTsD-_mg_ag4O9jwwGWIAs4Nuc" alt=""><figcaption>Marko from Vertt</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Can you tell us about your background as a developer?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>I am a full-stack developer with two years of experience. Vertt is my first major project and my first time working on a project of this magnitude. This project is where <strong>I gained most of my knowledge and learned about the big picture.</strong> I’m developing <strong>the backend logic in NodeJS</strong> for the entire system. I’m also working on the dashboard for our business team in Angular. I’ve worked on just a few projects prior to this. They were mostly small websites that didn’t require a backend component or scalability features.</p>



<h2><strong>Why did you choose a microservice infrastructure for this particular project?</strong></h2>



<p>We often see startups <a href="https://microtica.com/why-transition-from-monolith-to-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicking off with a monolithic application</a> just to get something out there. However, when they expand, they face <strong>various problems related to scalability and continuous integration</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>We wanted to do it the right way. </em>The <a href="https://microtica.com/everything-about-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of the microservice architecture</a> are well-known. <strong>Different codebases, separate deployable units performing separate functionalities</strong>, and the most important for us—<strong>scaling individually</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How did you deliver software before discovering Microtica?</strong></h2>



<p>We started using <strong>Jenkins </strong>as part of our DevOps process. As our team consists of full-stack and mobile developers, we were really <strong>struggling with all the setup and integration of numerous plug-ins.</strong> We were using Jenkins as a build orchestration tool. We soon became very <strong>limited by the release management</strong> that Jenkins has to offer. Issues like access control management, configuration usability, and scaling began to overwhelm us and defocus us from our daily tasks.</p>



<p>As the team began to grow, tracking and accountability of various team members became a great issue. As we did most deployments and builds via a single user,<strong> tracking was only at the code level </strong>through our source control tool Git.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What was the biggest challenge you had as a developer working with cloud automation?</strong></h2>



<p>The main challenge for any beginner or intermediate developer is <strong>connecting all pieces together </strong>and making them work as one. Understanding how the entire system is designed and managed behind the curtain in the cloud is a continuous process that consists of <strong>constant learning and hands-on effort.</strong> Coming across stuff like cloud automation, scaling, and continuous delivery is always challenging, especially if you don’t have much experience to get started.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How did Microtica help you overcome these challenges?</strong></h2>



<p>Microtica made deploying our entire system extremely<strong> easy and effortless.</strong> With just a few clicks and a few extra files, we set up and deployed our entire system consisting of 13 microservices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After <a href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">setting up our initial development environment</a> <strong>it only took us one hour to get the test and production environments up and running.</strong> For this, we used the Clone Environment feature. This was really important to us because we wanted to fully migrate to Microtica before going to production.</p>



<p>The integration went <strong>smoothly and pretty fast</strong>. We only needed to create a couple of files in each microservice to create and guide the deployment pipeline. Now we can change parameters and redeploy our services within minutes and with almost no downtime.</p>



<p>It was extremely helpful that we could use their ready-to-use components. This eliminated the need to write complex CloudFormation templates for simple AWS resources. It allowed us to reuse the components by using just the UI.</p>



<h2><strong>How did Microtica help you grow as a developer?</strong></h2>



<p>Before working with Microtica, I didn’t have much experience and knowledge in the cloud automation space. Microtica gave me <strong>an initial push</strong>.  It made me confident enough to <strong>set up and maintain a fully functional system with three environments.</strong> I could create custom infrastructure and deploy microservices in the cloud <strong>in a matter of days.</strong> It allowed me to focus more on the actual development and less on infrastructure maintenance.</p>



<h2><strong>What kind of challenges are ahead of you and your team?</strong></h2>



<p>Our system is expanding on a daily basis along with its complexity. With a new feature every month, it’s crucial for us to have a firm grasp of<strong> the entire system at any time</strong>. Since we made a production release, <strong>stability has become our number one priority.</strong> It’s also probably the biggest challenge that we will face in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><span>What is Imba?</span></h2><p>Imba is a new programming language for the web that compiles
to performant JavaScript. It is heavily inspired by ruby and python,
but developed explicitly for web programming (both server and client).
Imba treats DOM elements as a first-class citizens. These elements are compiled to an <a href="https://www.imba.io/guides/advanced/performance"><span>inline dom</span></a>, which is an <a href="https://somebee.github.io/dom-reconciler-bench/index.html"><span>order of magnitude faster</span></a> than todays virtual dom implementations. We truly believe that it opens up for a new way of developing web applications.</p>
<h2><span>Installation</span></h2><p><code data-lang="imba"><span>yarn </span><span>global </span><span>add </span><span>imba </span><span># npm install -g imba</span></code><code data-lang="js">var self = {};
self.yarn(global(self.add(self.imba()))); // npm install -g imba</code></p><h2><span>Developers</span></h2><p>Rather than being an academic exercise, Imba has been developed over several years, alongside actual applications. Imba has been fine-tuned to ease the challenges we face when developing rich, dynamic apps (and sites).</p>
<h2><span>Interoperability</span></h2><p>Imba compiles down to clean and readable JavaScript. Your formatting, indentaiton, and comments are included. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from Imba, and vica-versa.</p>
<h2><span>Speed</span></h2><p>You can use all the syntactic sugar in Imba without needing to worry about the performance and readability of the compiled code, and building your views using Imba's native support for tags results in unprecedented performance. </p>

<p>Even though Imba has been used privately, in production, for more than a year (powering scrimba.com), the community is  in the early stages, and documentation is still sparse. We're incredibly grateful for any feedback, suggestions, and help with the documentation!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span>Syntax &amp; Semantics</span></h2><p>Even though the syntax and semantics of Imba is much more related to Ruby than JavaScript, it does compile down to plain performant JavaScript, and is fully compatible with any existing JavaScript library. Imba does not extend any native types from JavaScript. Arrays are arrays, strings are strings, numbers are numbers, classes are constructors with prototypes and so forth. If you simply like Imba better, there is no reason not to write your npm package in Imba, even if it is supposed to be used in the general JavaScript ecosystem. In fact, Imba produces <em>very</em> readable JavaScript, by keeping your indentation, comments, and coding style.</p>

<p>The first architecture is reminiscent of the map-reduce paradigm.
The idea is to split analysis into relatively simple indexing phase, and a separate full analysis phase.</p>
<p>The core constraint of indexing is that it runs on a per-file basis.
The indexer takes the text of a single file, parses it, and spits out some data about the file.
The indexer can’t touch other files.</p>
<p>Full analysis can read other files, and it leverages information from the index to save work.</p>
<p>This all sounds way too abstract, so let’s look at a specific example — Java.
In Java, each file starts with a package declaration.
The indexer concatenates the name of the package with a class name to get a fully-qualified name (FQN).
It also collects the set of methods declared in the class, the list of superclasses and interfaces, etc.</p>
<p>Per-file data is merged into an index which maps FQNs to classes.
Note that constructing this mapping is an embarrassingly parallel task — all files are parsed independently.
Moreover, this map is cheap to update.
When a file change arrives, this file’s contribution from the index is removed, the text of the file is changed and the indexer runs on the new text and adds the new contributions.
The amount of work to do is proportional to the number of changed files, and is independent from the total number of files.</p>
<p>Let’s see how FQN index can be used to quickly provide completion.</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The user has just typed <code>Foo.f().</code>, and we need to figure out that the type of receiver expression is <code>Bar</code>, and suggest <code>g</code> as a completion.</p>
<p>First, as the file <code>Main.java</code> is modified, we run the indexer on this single file.
Nothing has changed (the file still contains the class <code>Main</code> with a static <code>main</code> method), so we don’t need to update the FQN index.</p>
<p>Next, we need to resolve the name <code>Foo</code>.
We parse the file, notice an <code>import</code> and look up <code>mypackage.Foo</code> in the FQN index.
In the index, we also find that <code>Foo</code> has a static method <code>f</code>, so we resolve the call as well.
The index also stores the return type of <code>f</code>, but, and this is crucial, it stores it as a string <code>"Bar"</code>, and not as a direct reference to the class <code>Bar</code>.</p>
<p>The reason for that is <code>import java.util.*</code> in <code>Foo.java</code>.
<code>Bar</code> can refer either to <code>java.util.Bar</code> or to <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
The indexer doesn’t know which one, because it can look <strong>only</strong> at the text of <code>Foo.java</code>.
In other words, while the index does store the return types of methods, it stores them in an unresolved form.</p>
<p>The next step is to resolve the identifier <code>Bar</code> in the context of <code>Foo.java</code>.
This uses the FQN index, and lands in the class <code>mypackage.Bar</code>.
There the desired method <code>g</code> is found.</p>
<p>Altogether, only three files were touched during completion.
The FQN index allowed us to completely ignore all the other files in the project.</p>
<p>One problem with the approach described thus far is that resolving types from the index requires a non-trivial amount of work.
This work might be duplicated if, for example, <code>Foo.f</code> is called several times.
The fix is to add a cache.
Name resolution results are memoized, so that the cost is paid only once.
The cache is blown away completely on any change — with an index, reconstructing the cache is not that costly.</p>
<p>To sum up, the first approach works like this:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Each file is being indexed, independently and in parallel, producing a "stub" — a set of visible top-level declarations, with unresolved types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All stubs are merged into a single index data structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution and type inference work primarily off the stubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name resolution is lazy (we only resolve a type from the stub when we need it) and memoized (each type is resolved only once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The caches are completely invalidated on every change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The index is updated incrementally:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if the edit doesn’t change the file’s stub, no change to the index is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>otherwise, old keys are removed and new keys are added</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Note an interesting interplay between "dumb" indexes which can be updated incrementally, and "smart" caches, which are re-computed from scratch.</p>
<p>This approach combines simplicity and stellar performance.
The bulk of work is the indexing phase, and you can parallelize and even distribute it across several machine.
Two examples of this architecture are <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> and <a href="https://sorbet.org/">Sorbet</a>.</p>
<p>The main drawback of this approach is that it works only when it works — not every language has a well-defined FQN concept.
I think overall it’s a good idea to design name resolution and module systems (mostly boring parts of a language) such that they work well with the map-reduce paradigm.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Require <code>package</code> declarations or infer them from the file-system layout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forbid meta-programming facilities which add new top-level declarations, or restrict them in such way that they can be used by the indexer.
For example, preprocessor-like compiler plugins that access a single file at a time might be fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that each source element corresponds to a single semantic element.
For example, if the language supports conditional compilation, make sure that it works during name resolution (like Kotlin’s <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/platform-specific-declarations.html">expect/actual</a>) and not during parsing (like conditional compilation in most other languages).
Otherwise, you’d have to index the same file with different conditional compilation settings, and that is messy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that FQNs are enough for most of the name resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The last point is worth elaborating. Let’s look at the following Rust example:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11

15
16
17
18
</pre></td><td><pre><span>// File: ./foo.rs</span>
<span>trait</span> <span>T</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// File: ./bar.rs</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>

<span>// File: ./somewhere/else.rs</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>T</span> <span>for</span> <span>S</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>// File: ./main.s</span>
<span>use</span> <span>foo</span><span>::</span><span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> <span>bar</span><span>::</span><span>S</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.f</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, we can easily find the <code>S</code> struct and the <code>T</code> trait (as they are imported directly).
However, to make sure that <code>s.f</code> indeed refers to <code>f</code> from <code>T</code>, we also need to find the corresponding <code>impl</code>, and that can be roughly anywhere!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Cambridge, MA, July 14, 2020: <a href="https://tiledb.com/">TileDB, Inc.</a> has secured a $15M Series A investment round led by <a href="https://twobearcapital.com/">Two Bear Capital</a>, joined by <a href="https://uncorrelated.com/">Uncorrelated Ventures</a> and all existing investors: <a href="https://nexusvp.com/">Nexus Venture Partners</a>, <a href="http://www.intelcapital.com/">Intel Capital</a>, and <a href="https://bigpi.vc/">Big Pi Ventures</a>. The funding will help the company expand go-to-market and product development for its “universal data engine,” a novel database that goes beyond tables to manage any complex data and beyond SQL to analyze the data with any tool, all serverless and at planet scale. Montana philanthropist and Two Bear Capital Managing Partner Mike Goguen will join TileDB’s Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The Series A financing comes after TileDB was chosen by customers who experienced two key pains: scalability for complex data and deployment. Whole-genome population data, single-cell gene data, spatio-temporal satellite imagery, and asset-trading data all share multi-dimensional structures that are poorly handled by monolithic databases, tables, and legacy file formats. Newer computational frameworks evolved to offer “pluggable storage” but that forces another part of the stack to deal with data management. As a result, organizations waste resources on managing a sea of files and optimizing storage performance, tasks traditionally done by the database. Moreover, developers and data scientists are spending excessive time in data engineering and deployment, instead of actual analysis and collaboration.</p>
<p>“We flipped the data management model,” said Dr. Stavros Papadopoulos, CEO and original creator of TileDB. “We invented a database that focuses on universal storage and data management rather than the compute layer, which we’ve instead made `pluggable.` We cleared the path for analytics professionals and data scientists by taking over the messiest parts of data management, such as optimized storage for all data types on numerous backends, data versioning, metadata, access control within or outside organizational boundaries, and logging. On top, we developed numerous APIs for fast direct data access and efficient integrations with a growing set of popular tools such as Spark, Dask, MariaDB and PrestoDB. Finally, we built a serverless infrastructure for easy, secure cross-organizational sharing and scalable compute, called TileDB Cloud.”</p>
<p>According to Scott Soenen, VP of Product Engineering at Capella Space: “The partnership with TileDB gelled perfectly with our desire to deliver a new level of innovation in open data programs aimed at the geospatial community. Open data alone isn’t enough. It’s also about easy access to compute resources and versatility of analytics. TileDB Cloud removes multiple manual steps in data access for the geospatial developer community and offers intuitive self-service and interactive analytics."</p>
<p>“We have chosen TileDB as the storage engine to power our cellxgene project at CZI, which is an interactive data explorer for single-cell transcriptomics datasets,” said Bruce Martin, Director of Engineering, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. “TileDB provides an easy and powerful way to manage our huge array data on various backends, including cloud object stores. The serverless infrastructure of TileDB Cloud opens the door to extreme scale with very low engineering efforts on our part, allowing us to focus more on scientific discoveries instead.”</p>
<p>Magnus Isaksson, Director of Bioinformatics, Helix shared, “The synergy between our two companies has enabled us to take an innovative approach to storing and analyzing genomic data at population-scale. We were excited to find TileDB after extensive diligence of potential solutions that could meet Helix's needs and advance our vision to revolutionize population health via the power of genomics."</p>
<p>“Many of the world’s most urgent problems - from COVID to climate change - require the analysis of large volumes of data in order to find solutions. TileDB’s technology addresses the infrastructure deficit that adds friction, delay, and cost to generating the key insights and discoveries needed from this data,” said Mike Goguen, Managing Partner at Two Bear Capital and lead investor. “We are excited to partner with Stavros and TileDB to build an enduring company delivering massive value for the developers and enterprise customers working to solve these and other critically important problems.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before and during the development of the Bythlon safety performance pedal system's technology, we comprehensively researched <a href="https://bythlon-pedal.myshopify.com/pages/cycling-science" title="Cycling Science">cycling science</a>, especially the biomechanics of the pedal stroke, the technology, and the benefits of the existing clipless pedal systems.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We could confirm from the widely publicized benefits that cleats indeed secure the shoe in place on the pedal to prevent slipping and that the purposely developed road bike shoes with extremely stiff soles improve pedal power and most likely reduce the risk of injury.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the main argument for cleats dates back to the days where cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with shoe clips and straps. The idea behind that is to generate a 'perfect' stroke, pedaling with one leg pushing down while the other is pulling up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Most cyclists accept this as a foregone conclusion. There is probably no cyclist who has not heard the advice to aim for a 'round' pedal stroke. The cleat pedal is probably perceived as the essential bike component that separates the casual or novice from the ambitious and experienced rider, even more so than carbon frames or wheels.</span></p>

<p>So before our conclusion, let us look into Eriscon's and later finding regarding the muscle groups involved. The pedal stroke generates force by hip and knee extension and flexion. An extension is used pushing down during the power phase, and flexion is used to recover the pedal back to the top of the cycle for the next downstroke.</p>
<p>Glutes, Quads, and Calfs work together, pushing down and Hip Flexor and Hamstring pulling up. Just by looking at the size of these muscle groups, we realize that the extensor muscles are much larger than than the flexors.</p>
<p>That makes sense since the legs functional movements, the daily life's moves are all related to pushing: Walking, running, squatting, and lifting all require the legs to push. The only pulling movement in daily life is to lift the leg up for another step. It never has to raise more than its weight, if you disregard the weight of shoes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nowadays, developing <strong>ReactJS</strong> with TypeScript gives us a solid way to write applications: it adds the advantage of type-safety, component auto-documentation, error handling, and accurate autocomplete in the editor code. However, it still requires a considerable effort to write <em>types</em> and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seems redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GraphQL Code Generator</strong></a>&nbsp;gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:&nbsp;</strong>forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong>&nbsp;as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the&nbsp;<strong>dependencies</strong>&nbsp;needed:</p><pre><p><span>1</span><span>npm</span><span> i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre><pre><p><span>1</span><span>npm</span><span> i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre><p>I'm considering the following&nbsp;<strong>folder structure</strong>, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><p><span>1</span><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>2</span><span> ┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>3</span><span> ┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>4</span><span> ┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>5</span><span> ┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>6</span><span> ┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>7</span><span> ┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>8</span><span> ┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>9</span><span> ┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>10</span><span> ┗ package.json</span></p></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project,&nbsp;named <code>codegen.yml</code>.

        Between 23:54 UTC yesterday (2020-07-20) and 15:35 UTC today, we suffered from a catastrophic SQL failure which forced us to restore from backup.</p><p>

There may be some credit issues where the system granted more or fewer credits than you expect for work done during this time.<br>
I can't apologize enough. If our BOINC deployment was architected for scale rather than for low cost, we could've avoided this.</p><p>

There are several enhancements to our infrastructure and upgrades we'd like to make, such as migrating services to Kubernetes and potentially using a managed SQL service.</p><p>

        <span>Minecraft@Home is now <span color="red">over one month old</span>! To celebrate this milestone, I present a new research focus; the panorama project.</span></p><p>

If you were here during beta-testing, you might have received a very early version of panorama tasks, and the eagle-eyed among you may have seen the application details <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/server_status.php" rel="nofollow">on the server status page</a>.</p><p>

<span><b>The panorama app is a CUDA-only app for Linux and Windows with an Nvidia driver version of 418.96 or higher.</b></span></p><p>

This project attempts to find the world seed of the iconic panorama image which appeared in the background of the main menu of Minecraft between 2011 and 2018. The first phase of this project will only last a few days, and we shall update you with their progress in the coming weeks.</p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3dyexWe.png"></p><p>

Right now, the application is quite substantial. Unlike the OpenCL applications for the Kaktwoos project, <b>if you allow BOINC to run tasks always; you may experience some stuttering or lag in your desktop environment while running these tasks</b>. These tasks do not have checkpointing support, but run in around 1 hour on an average host to mitigate the majority of lost cycles.</p><p>

<span>As always, <a href="https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/prefs.php?subset=project" rel="nofollow">you can change which projects of which you decide to participate in your user preferences</a>.</span></p><p>

Let us know if you have any questions, and as always join the discussion over on <a href="https://discord.gg/xVFh9bp" rel="nofollow">the Discord server.</a>

        You may have seen many workunits just disappear from existence today.</p><p>

Worry not! We realised there were far too many workunits scanning duplicate seeds, so we've scaled back the original workunits to the correct seed ranges <span><i>(no in-progress results were touched, so none of you should have lost any credit)</i></span>.</p><p>

We have located some promising seed candidates which were missed from processing and can be used as an input to this job, so they are currently set as the highest priority.</p><p>

Also, <span><b>we now have badges</b></span>! If you view the forums, any comments in threads, or on the leaderboards; you will see the new badges.<br>
We're open to suggestions for future badges, so please leave us some comments on this thread.

Also, good news for hosts with OpenCL capable hardware from more than one vendor <i>(e.g. an Intel iGPU and an Nvidia GPU)</i><br>
The latest update to the kaktwoos app should ensure the tasks run on the correct device.<br>

<h4><i>Seeking creative space, I spent two months exploring productivity and tools for thought. Here's what I discovered.</i></h4>

<p>I recently learned that Netflix tested a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/02/netflix-too-much-to-watch-speed-watching">speed-watching</a>” feature and it seems the most apt metaphor for our era. Too much content stressing you out? Try watching it faster. Far more likely is that it’ll go on some sort of list. A watch it, read, it, do it later sort of list. These lists have become a digital extension of <a href="https://cdn8.openculture.com/2018/07/10223435/Tsunduko_.jpg">Tsundoku</a>: the Japanese art of buying books and not reading them. Now we hoard ideas, articles, and links and never do anything with them.</p>

<p>This feeling can be stressful, as our creative need to engage with the world collides with relentless change, particularly for those in the digital sphere. In 2019, Nobel prize-winning Psychologist Daniel Kahneman said that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKSts1lNZhc&amp;feature=emb_title">Technology evolves exponentially, whereas our mechanisms for coping are linear</a>”, and that struck a chord. Never has this been more evident than now, mid-pandemic, as we exchange the subtle, reassuring friction of normal living for the “always-on”, performance mode of online existence.</p>

<p>This isn’t new, though. In 2012, Cal Newport wrote about knowledge workers lacking <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/">a culture of improving their systems of work</a>. Rather than improve our process, we tend to focus on managing email, and lots of it. Technology, it seems, has opened up incredible opportunities while contributing to a “great frazzling” of our collective minds. Yet there is something different about the current situation we find ourselves in. In particular, the digital impact of the pandemic. One of my favourite writers, <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr">Venkatesh Rao</a>, recently hinted at the significance of this shift:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Software eating the world is going through an inflection point I thought wouldn’t arrive till 2030. The pandemic has accelerated the schedule by 10 years. <a href="https://pca.st/mm2vlx3d">[source]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even for those who wouldn’t consider themselves very tech-inclined, it’s easy to see the truth in this. Couples are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-weddings-during-coronavirus-photos-2020-4?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">getting married via Zoom</a>. Parents can <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/07/facetime-babies/">FaceTime babies in neonatal units.</a> A woman <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/potato-boss-video-call">accidentally turned herself into a potato during a digital happy hour</a>. <strong>Software is the world now.</strong> And it would be nice if we made it work for us, for once.</p>

<h2 id="second-brains">Second Brains</h2>

<p>During Ireland’s lockdown, I found myself with more time to explore this thought. By chance I came across Tiago Forte’s <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/"><em>Building a Second Brain</em></a>, which advertised a “<em>world-class idea management system in 35 days</em>.” It sounded fascinating, albeit outside my price range. I read around the area instead, starting with some of his early work. His first course seemed useful, called <em><a href="https://learn.fortelabs.co/p/get-stuff-done-like-a-boss">Get Stuff Done</a>,</em> and I signed up. It was a digital-reimagining of David Allen’s famous <em><a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>:</em> a book I had read when younger. At the time I had found it difficult to integrate as it was so rooted in physical artefacts like folders and paper. A tough sell, when my life was becoming ever more digital.</p>

</figure>

<p>The course was excellent, and finally cemented the GTD workflow for me with digital tools, but Tiago hinted at a more important takeaway. He suggested that automating our daily efforts saves us mental energy, and frees us to focus on the creative, interesting parts of life. Right there was a glimmer of something more valuable: that high-leverage digital tools could help me spend more time having fun with ideas. I was obsessed.</p>

<p>I decided to follow Tiago’s structure of <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/"><em>PARA</em></a> (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives) and practice of <em><a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1142899542360297473">CODE</a></em> (Collect, Organise, Distill, Express) to structure my notes, and committed to it for a couple of weeks. Every so often, an idea would form, which I would capture, and over time it would either “bubble-up” by my returning to it, or would fade out as it wasn’t significant or relevant. The effort was low, but the return was high. I concerned myself less with management and more on what I found interesting. The result, after a month or so, had no fanfare, or celebration. In fact, it was almost anticlimactic, as there was no reactivity, stress, or concern. Left instead was a stillness that you could feel bored with, if you were of that persuasion. Instead, I found myself thinking, creating, and exploring far more in this new free space.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, I dug deeper. I learned about the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1">Zettelkasten Method</a>, by reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y"><em>How to Take Smart Notes</em></a>, both likely geneses for <em>Building a Second Brain.</em> I doubled-down on earlier attempts at noise-reduction by reading Cal Newport’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">Deep Work</a></em> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Minimalism-Living-Better-Technology-ebook/dp/B07D1G6DTF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2IMCD9N2NEGR1&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=digital+minimalism&amp;qid=1594227304&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=digital+min%2Camazon-devices%2C157&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Digital Minimalism</em></a>. My phone went on permanent “Do Not Disturb” and I found healthy space in a fixed and sustainable schedule. I became a lab rat for these ideas, because <em>they actually worked</em>.</p>

<p>Coupling these three strategies together: <strong>automating the daily, repeatable parts of living</strong>, <strong>reducing external noise,</strong> and <strong>building an ad-hoc knowledge graph</strong>, created a situation I so longed for — the possibility of taking on well-defined personal projects with specific outcomes, knowing that if I had new ideas along the way, I wouldn’t lose them. In fact, they may even have improved by the time I engaged with them.</p>

<p>To test this further, I started two courses by Dr. Barbara Oakley called <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift">Mindshift</a>.</em> I found significant parallels between Dr Oakley’s description of how the mind creates knowledge “chunks” and creating notes in my “<em>Second Brain</em>”, as both develop knowledge graphs that aid creativity. I took notes throughout, often finding that they sparked associations between notes in very different areas — a phenomenon Dr Oakley calls <em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/mrPn2/the-value-of-a-library-of-chunks">Transfer</a>.</em> Linking these concepts was trivial now, as they were just nodes in a digital graph.</p>

<p>I had found a solution to Cal Newport’s concerns, and it didn’t involve sending email.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-it-down">Breaking It Down</h2>

<p>If you’re a knowledge worker starting this journey, you too may feel overwhelmed at the amount that life and work expects of you. If you have no system at all, writing down all the tasks required of you on a single sheet of paper is a great start. This brain dump is essential, as we have limited working memory (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/X7E9r/introduction-to-memory">roughly 4 “slots</a>”) and whatever isn’t written down continues to occupy that space. At some point, you may find that this system won’t scale to the breadth or depth of tasks required of you. I found my solution in <em>Getting Things Done</em> with <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things3</a>, but there are other methodologies <a href="https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-getting-things-done-1551880955">outlined in this article</a> that may suit you better.</p>

<p>Managing your tasks is an excellent first step, but you may still experience information overload. Most knowledge workers (at least in software engineering) have an enormous quantity of material to read, reference, and recall at short notice. Few have a system to manage this. Tiago Forte’s <em><a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">PARA</a></em> shines here, as a flexible and useful system for managing hierarchies of reference material. Digital tools are the only prerequisite, and many are available, depending on your needs. <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, and <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> are great for general users. Academics may prefer <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> or <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.</p>

<p>At this stage you may feel more in control. Great! You could stop here, but there is a final step, and it’s the most important. I mentioned that Tiago Forte uses the acronym <em><a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1142899542360297473">CODE</a></em> to describe the process of Collecting, Organising, Distilling, and Expressing what you read and reference. By now, you should be accomplishing the first two letters of that acronym. The remaining two, distilling and expressing, are important aspects of the <em><a href="https://nesslabs.com/generation-effect">Generation Effect</a>:</em> a phenomenon where active engagement with material leads to greater recall. If you want to understand what you read, you need to do something with it. That action is note-taking.</p>

<p>Taking notes can be as simple as ensuring you read with a pen and notebook to hand. I find this doesn’t scale very well though, and also doesn’t mirror how my mind works. I want networked thought, graphs of ideas, thoughts linking to other thoughts, and so do many others. Tools like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, and <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> resolve this as they represent literal graphs of thinking, allowing your ideas to cluster, link, and collide as unique insights. Choose a tool, and write about what you read in your own words. You can explore, create, and extrapolate in any way you wish. You may take a different approach to the next person, and that’s encouraged, as these tools should augment <em>your</em> thoughts. And that’s what they are: tools to aid your thoughts. Augmentations to help your brain make sense of the world.</p>

<p>What you end up developing, ultimately, is an idea machine, and a process to get the most from it. This starts from a place of “deep unknowing”, to a system which shows you the most unique and interesting intersections of your thoughts as geneses for new writing. The “daunting blank page” should never be blank again.</p>



<p>While exploring this rabbit hole, I learned that Personal Knowledge Managment (PKM) is a discrete area of study, rather than a new area of focus. Tiago Forte’s “<em>Second Brain</em>” had acted as an accessible entry point: a marketable tool for knowledge workers; but there is ample room for innovation beyond this approach. Andy Matuschak’s <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">Evergreen notes</a> outline a new theory for this area, and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/">digital</a> <a href="https://www.notion.so/Rethinking-My-Thinking-e565d53ca7394314814b0fcf306dc0bf#a3fef6cac37c4a239458e739b66204e1">gardening</a> has become a very tactile metaphor for exploring ideas in public. There is an emerging “new wave” also, focused <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc">less on the act of note-taking</a>, and more on augmented thinking as the emergent frontier.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777">The Righteous Mind</a></em> by Jonathan Haidt explains the link between our conscious, calculating mind and our subconscious, instinctive mind with a metaphor: <em><a href="https://www.creativehuddle.co.uk/the-elephant-and-the-rider">The Elephant and the Rider</a></em>:</p>



<ul><li>The rider is our “conscious”, reasoning mind, which uses explainable logic to reason about the world, our own behavior, and our preferences&nbsp;</li><li>The elephant is the momentum of pre-trained and pre-wired preferences with which we make “snap” decisions about preferences or morality.</li></ul>



<p>The rider — <em>homo logicus</em> — believes itself to be in control of the elephant, but this is only about 10% true.&nbsp; In truth, when the rider and elephant disagree about which direction to ride, the elephant almost always wins. &nbsp; The rider instead spends time making excuses to justify why it really <em>intended</em> to go that direction all along!</p>



<p>Or, non-metaphorically: the vast majority of the time, we use our “thinking” mind to explain and generate justifications <em>for </em>our snap judgements — but our thinking mind only rarely is able to actually redirect our pre-trained biases into choices we <em>really don’t want </em>to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Occasionally, if it’s a topic we don’t have strong pre-trained preferences about (“What’s your opinion on the gold standard?”), the rider has control — but possibly only until the elephant catches a familiar scent (“The gold standard <em>frees</em> individuals from the <em>control</em> of governmental fiat”) and we fall back to pre-wired beliefs.</p>



<p>Most of the time, the rider (our thinking brain)’s job is to explain <em>why </em>the elephant is walking the direction it is — providing concrete explainable justifications for beliefs whose <em>real </em>foundation is genetic pre-wiring (“Why are spiders scary?”) or decades of imprinting (“Why is incest bad?”)</p>



<p>But even though the rider isn’t, strictly speaking, <em>in control,</em> it’s the glue which helped us level up from smart apes to quasi-hive organisms with cities, indoor plumbing, and senatorial filibusters.&nbsp; By nudging our elephants in <em>roughly</em> the right direction once in a while, we can build civilizations and only rarely atomize each other.</p>



<hr>



<p>Traditional visions of AI — and the AI still envisioned by popular culture —&nbsp; is cold, structured, logic incarnate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most early game AIs performed a minimax search when choosing a move, methodically evaluating the search space.&nbsp; The AI would calculate for each move how to counter the best possible move the opponent could make, and then would perform these calculations as deep as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#/media/File:Plminmax.gif">computing power permitted</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ud8kBw-1J-kflDLagogJfcjbvmWDZvug7RMZiu-RSZnyzCRwJNdk41gBvsWlSP8RjkzqQHP7-WnJ9tMVLqbgOtOyolxB0p67N1TnN6XMdE9UenqkC5tOsER1bnVSGpmbQXmQgm0c" alt=""></figure>



<p>This is still the AI portrayed in popular media.&nbsp; In a positive portrayal, the AI is precise, logical, and (somewhat) useful:</p>



<blockquote><p>C-3PO : Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1</p><p>Han Solo : Never tell me the odds.</p></blockquote>



<p>In a negative portrayal, AI is cold and calculating, but never pointlessly cruel.&nbsp; In <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, if HAL 9000 opened the pod bay doors, it would prove (in worst case) a potential risk to HAL 9000 (itself), and the mission.&nbsp; The rational move was to eliminate Dave.</p>



<blockquote><p>Bowman: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.</p><p>HAL 9000: I’m sorry, Dave. I’m afraid I can’t do that.</p></blockquote>



<p>HAL 9000 was simply playing chess against Dave.</p>



<p>NLP and structured knowledge extraction operated similarly.&nbsp; NLP techniques&nbsp; were built to turn sentences into query-able knowledge bases via structured information extraction.&nbsp; Facts were extracted from natural-language sentences and stored in <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html">knowledge bases</a>:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OrUt92J_TuAMdpIwV0YPFVwJ63ILJBu-O1jL5sFmPjr0NE9Scb4lolprW_dVt_gABmBB71E85Wegjk1A4bCF8NlS9VT-xOmwZvajEeTTf9o5_u5NDOzHAEBmSTQsg-J4FmVl7ISJ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Decisions made by AI systems which used information extraction techniques were fully explainable, because they were built from explicit extracted facts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These visions of AI all envisioned artificial agents as the elephant <em>riders</em>, in which decisions were made upon cold facts.&nbsp; Perhaps we first tried to build explainable AI because we preferred to see <em>ourselves </em>as the riders — a strictly logical agent in firm control of our legacy animal instincts.</p>



<hr>



<p>But modern AI is the elephant.</p>



<p>Neural networks have replaced traditional structured AI in almost every real application — in both academia and industry.&nbsp; These networks are fast, effective, dynamic, easy to train (for enough money), and <em>completely unexplainable.</em></p>



<p>Neural networks imitate animal cognition by modeling computation as layers of connected neurons, each neuron connected to downstream neurons with varying strength:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2lh5kehxTJGR_nn_wxlFEIBFDigu6Jss7NzCvGHFJ17W_V2R3D_lJxqGDaztJ729GxlRK1bdaWmAxBBP53R5KHEpGKEsBTKz0X3R2o_tX3M-hW6GVFxvRYHPnV-DIu9wnfNt9gWy" alt=""></figure>



<p>There’s a huge amount of active research into how to design more effective neural networks, how to most efficiently train neural networks, and how to build hardware which most effectively simulates neural networks (for example, Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">Tensor Processor Units</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But none of this research changes the fact that neural networks are (perhaps by design) <em>not explainable — </em>training produces networks which are able to answer questions quickly and often correctly, but the trained network is just a mathematical array of weighted vectors which cannot be meaningfully translated into human language for inspection.&nbsp; The only way to evaluate the AI is to see what it does.</p>



<p>This is the elephant.&nbsp; And it is wildly effective.</p>



<hr>



<p><a href="https://news.developer.nvidia.com/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/">GPT-3</a> is the world’s most advanced neural network (developed by the OpenAI consortium), and an API backed by GPT-3 was soft-released over the past couple weeks to high-profile beta users. &nbsp; GPT-3 is a neural network with 175 billion trained parameters (by far the world’s largest publicly documented neural network).&nbsp; It was trained on a wide range of internet-available text sources.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is a predictive model — that is, provide it the first part of a block of text, and it will generate the text which it predicts should come next.&nbsp; The simplest application of text prediction is writing stories, which GPT-3 <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-3-experiments/blob/master/examples/unicorn/output_0_7.md">excels at</a> (the prompt is in <strong>bold,</strong> generated text below):</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7H0XZMG_DF8YBEcPxElNs0CSIc6DCDyfw4dwNrSkSBKTXa53f2HeG1f3RQ3pQA71taUyjiuNg8mPvv2e6k1qINrZEF9GLz9T8FeCplKx00RiSALQzrDiuK-6O-wCF9IOLEeX5w0v" alt=""></figure>



<p>But text prediction is equally applicable to everyday conversation.&nbsp; GPT-3 can, with prompting, answer <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497/photo/1">everyday questions</a>, and even identify when questions are nonsensical (generated answers at the bottom):</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RKblkR2q12adL6nIo-VRCYb5FLaQX5J9gd7YAaXy9si8wULHYpt0FngcptgQ2gJrqe_jVCEMlM_NNjLi97az98WyFJgOfnLWGMPxHsUf0Z_qsvbTnbd3EXihOJ00494uNraXmxRZ" alt=""></figure>



<p>Gwern has <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3">generated</a> GPT-3 responses on a wide range of prompts, categorizing where it does well and where it does poorly.&nbsp; Not every response is impressive, but many are, and the conclusion is that GPT-3 is a huge leap forward from GPT-2 (which used 1.5B parameters, vs GPT-3’s 175B).</p>



<hr>



<p>GPT-2 and GPT-3 have no model of the world, but that doesn’t stop them from having opinions when prompted.</p>



<p>GPT-2/3 are trained on the internet, and are thus the aggregated voice of anyone who has written an opinion on the internet.&nbsp; So they are very <em>good </em>at quickly generating judgements and opinions, even though they have absolutely no logical or moral framework backing those judgements.</p>



<p>Huggingface provides a <a href="https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large">publicly-accessible playground</a> to test GPT-2’s predictions on your own text inputs (GPT-3 is, for now, available only to internet celebrities and VCs).&nbsp; We can prompt GPT-2 for opinions on a variety of emotionally charged topics, like incest:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KUWi965-5Ky7aPo5uLju8SIU-VdGobIBfiUyRg19sSG09EXvWS_ShM8a0Lg0bZ5ngJu6Q_-RBkEmF0_74o3jYzYg2kMjLehS_UYJxyPHPFfmKov-Ey-LjfNdL99A2-9Z07rJy-hx" alt=""></figure>



<p>abortion:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Nj_tUgUrfk_tamMZOmUkWTOoCXhG23c7JBKU-gysCGG6DoTiVmk6A2lJTO__oRpyz1pbQ6Vy4SVVI-HJk9aiA3lGyAJ9LmB6tHZQ-bN48uIxkSqvFnK1XTT6d8oPLqMiNPOH48rX" alt=""></figure>



<p>and other topics likely to provoke an emotional response:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mo2gIlBIni5ZmF3JRGOLhcD3IG-GDn6WXnZtoGtXWfFXzN8Pw_QpqrCTopzQj0kltiukuq30r0_L6-1m6_Cna2kSvHsZzasvcw5FmLYmlEMuDf0chDwRKbRJBt3jNrsIW0Bjyaro" alt=""></figure>



<p>These are elephant responses, generated by volume of training data, not clever logical deduction .&nbsp; GPT-* has absolutely no model of the world or moral framework by which it generates logical responses — and yet the responses read as plausibly human.  </p>



<p>Because, after all, <em>we </em>are 90% elephant.  </p>



<hr>



<p>What does this mean for AI, and for us?</p>



<p>Most people have no idea what modern AI <em>is</em>, and that makes effective oversight of AI research by the public completely impossible.&nbsp; Media depictions of AI have only shown two plausible futures:</p>



<ul><li>Hyper-logical, explainable, “Friendly AI”: Data from <em>Star Trek</em>.&nbsp; Alien, but because of the <em>absence </em>of emotion</li><li>Hyper-logical, explainable, “Dangerous AI”: <em>Terminator</em>.&nbsp; Deadly, but for an explainable reason: the AI is eliminating a threat (us)</li></ul>



<p>These visions are so wildly far from the future we are in, that the public is less informed for having been shown them&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AIs we’ll <em>actually</em> interact with tomorrow — on Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or a MMORPG —&nbsp; are utterly un-logical.&nbsp; They are the pure distilled emotions of anyone who has ever voiced their opinions on the internet, amplified a thousandfold (and perhaps filtered for anger or love for <em>particular </em>targets, like China, Russia, or Haribo Gummy Bears).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we want the public to have any informed opinion about what, how, and where AI is deployed (and as GPT-3/4/5 seem poised to obviate <em>all creative writing</em>, among other careers, this seems like a reasonable ask), the first step is to stop showing them an inaccurate picture of what Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have actually built.</p>



<p>And second: if we <em>do </em>want to ever get the AI we saw in <em>Star Trek</em> (but hopefully not <em>Terminator</em>), we need to actually build a model-based, logical elephant <em>rider</em>, and not just the elephant itself — even though it’s <em>much, much, harder</em> than downloading 20 billion tweets of training data and throwing them at a trillion parameter neural network.</p>



<p>Or maybe we should figure out how to do it ourselves, first. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><blockquote>
<p>The <code>Expert</code> in anything was once a <code>Beginner</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I had a chance to  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/post/where-to-begin-ckcola56d0034s0s1goh56ua4/answer/ckcprkctw00fq9ss1boil9o7c">respond to the HashNode  discussion thread</a> asking, <em>Where to begin</em>? The question and my response to it was around a specific context but, after thinking more about it, I got the idea of expanding it as a blog article.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the word <code>beginner</code> is underrated. We use this term loosely and allow others to use it without realizing the true power behind it. This blog post is about my views of where to begin and the fun of being a beginner.</p>
<p>I am sure, you will be able to relate to it. It will be great to hear from your experiences as well. Please share your thoughts, learning, experiences as comments below.</p>

<p>We all are born as beginners. From a toddler to kid to teenager to an adult, a beginner's journey is about learning, improving, persisting and again loop the cycle for a new beginning. Believe me, we will be doing just the same for the entire life!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595142482429/Y8SwXwNfd.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Beginnercycle.png"></p>
<p>Exactly the same philosophy applies to the skill development, coding, programming, our creative work, whatever we take up next. All of the four stages are equally important for us to get transitioned from a beginner to an expert or master.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Begin:</code> Start of the journey.</li>
<li><code>Learn:</code> Being in the journey and discovering the end of it. </li>
<li><code>Improve:</code> Knowing the struggle and challenges of the past to ensure a better future of the journey.</li>
<li><code>Persist:</code> The ability to stay firm, focused, confident and try completing an enjoyable journey.</li>
</ul>

<p>A famous quote by Barbara Sher,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can learn new things at any time in your life if you're willing to be a beginner. If you actually learn to like being a beginner, the whole world opens up to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a beginner, the question of <em>where to begin</em> is very common. However finding the right answer may depend on various factors like,</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I beginning with?</li>
<li>Why am I doing this?</li>
<li>What's my end goal?</li>
<li>Is there a reference(or experience) to follow when I begin?</li>
<li>What if I fail?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-begin-with-the-end-in-mind">☑️ Begin with the end in mind</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161532368/gd3Hj3q8x.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="goal.gif"></p>
<p>This is about knowing the end goal at the beginning of the journey. Say, You want to learn reactjs and you do not have much ideas about it yet. That's fine but, you should have fair idea of why do you want to learn reactjs? What are you going to do with it? Is it going to help getting you the next cool job? or Is it for fun learning? certification etc?</p>
<p>Time is precious and invaluable and we must make a good use of it. There must be reasons of beginning something. Also beginning with the end in mind gives you enough planning opportunities to make your learning productive and fruitful.</p>
<h2 id="-motivation-is-important">☑️ Motivation is important</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161079335/3UPbGShgN.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="motivation.gif"></p>
<p>You have began. How are you doing? It is hard to continue without a motivation. Some of us are self motivated. Many of us need an external motivation factor. A motivation to begin something always helps us in completing the journey with positive outcome.</p>
<p>At present, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/n/2articles1week">#2articles1week</a> challenge motivates me to write articles for the technology community benefit. I began on the challenge with the motivation of writing at least 2 quality articles in a week and I am on it!</p>
<h2 id="-do-not-give-up">☑️ Do not give up</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161169170/bb2h4Yg20.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="hang_in.gif"></p>
<p>It is very easy to begin. It is equally challenging to hang on it without giving up. Most of the beginnings are not overnight things. It takes time. <code>Persistence</code> is the key here. </p>
<p>For example, let's take any skills. A skill takes time to learn, more time to be good at, much more time to be an expert or master.  Don't give up. Keep moving on.</p>
<h2 id="-follow-a-proven-path">☑️ Follow a proven path</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161474007/6c4BQNzfk.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="path.gif"></p>
<p>It is about learning from others and their experiences. One who has completed a journey or left in-between can help others guiding on similar path. Be an information seeker but, not necessarily you need to imitate.</p>
<p>For example, if you are beginning your journey to become a blogger, it makes sense to learn from the journey of other bloggers. How and where the journey began for them? What are the DOs and DON'Ts they have followed? You can always improvise on top of that to make it your own.</p>
<h2 id="-you-are-not-alone">☑️ You are not alone</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595161923820/ZmUuwkjK-.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="together.gif"></p>
<p>When you feel challenged, struggling with things to make it work, do not feel that the situation is unique to you. You are really not alone even when it seems so. Look around, ask for help.</p>
<p>Going back to the basics help many times in coming out of a challenging situation. Specially in the areas of skill development. Be part of  a community where you can learn and share. When it comes to the areas of skill development, no better support than a community to make you feel connected.</p>
<h2 id="-being-a-beginner-is-inevitable">☑️ Being a beginner is inevitable</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1595162437794/8eIIBryYV.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="start.gif"></p>
<p>Yes, this is true! Once a beginner is always a beginner. How? Let me explain.</p>
<p>You began on something, learned it, improved on it and persisted too. Now you are a subject matter expert on it. Are you going to stop with that? No, right? The ever curious mind of yours will find something else, something new to begin. Thus you are a beginner again.</p>

<p>So where to begin? If you are waiting, begin now. Begin with the resources you have in hands. If unsure, ask for help. Once began, stay motivated and do not give up. Good to have inspirations but, work towards making your own mark.</p>
<p>It is not just about where to begin, it is also about how to proceed, what to do and when to end. I would like to conclude this article with another famous motivational quote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never forget that, even the best was once a beginner. Don't be afraid to take that first step to greatness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>The sheer scale of the new GPT-3 model</span> is hard to overstate; it’s an entire <em>order of magnitude</em> larger than Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already-massive 17B parameter Turing-NLG</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Loading the entire model’s weights in fp16 would take up an absolutely preposterous 300GB of VRAM, not even including the gradients. But, with massive size comes massive generalization ability: GPT-3 is competitive in many benchmarks <em>without even tuning on the target task</em>. And when I say many, I mean <em>many</em>—the full, 72-page paper contains an extensive evaluation of GPT-3 on many NLP datasets. Through the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI API</a>, a vast array of impressive demos have sprung up taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of GPT-3 to do extremely disparate tasks. Perhaps the most impressive part, though, is that even at such a massive scale, the model still scales smoothly in performance instead of plateauing, implying that still-larger models would perform <em>even better</em>. Throughout the rest of this post, my goal is to distill this massive (in multiple ways) paper down to a digestible size, and shed some light on why it matters.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes some of the largest autoregressive Transformer models of the past few years. I’ve excluded models like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XLNet</a> and BERT-derivatives because they don’t have the same unidirectional autoregressive training target.</p>

<p>While GPT-3 isn’t that much deeper, its width is nearly <strong>3x</strong> that of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing-NLG</a>, which—since parameter count scales approximately proportional to the square of the hidden size—explains where most of the extra parameters come from. It also has double the context size, at 2048 tokens, which is impressive (and memory-expensive!), though not the biggest context size across all models; some models have even longer contexts, like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transformer-XL</a>, which incorporates longer contexts by passing context vectors between segments, and <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/01/reformer-efficient-transformer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reformer</a>, which uses locality-sensitive hashing to enable sparser attention. Similarly, GPT-3 uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparse attention layers</a> in every other layer, though the exact details are left somewhat ambiguous. It’s also interesting to note that the smaller GPT-3 versions trained for comparison with GPT-2 are slightly shallower and wider, with GPT-3-XL having only 24 layers but a hidden size of 2048.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> GPT-3 also reuses the BPE tokenization of GPT-2. Overall, GPT-3 is essentially just a downright massive version of GPT-2.</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/tdata.png" alt="Weighted Training Data (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The training data is a reweighted mix of Common Crawl, WebText2 (a larger version of the original that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also includes links sampled in the period of Jan-Oct 2018</a>), two book corpora, and English Wikipedia. Some of these components, such as Wikipedia, were seen more than 3 times during training; others, like the massive Common Crawl component, had less than half of their data seen. The authors claim that this is to help raise the overall quality of the corpus by prioritising known-good datasets. Also, in contrast to the original WebText, this new corpus is not filtered by language, but English still constitutes 93% of the dataset by words simply due to its prevalence. Altogether, the dataset is 500 billion tokens, or 700GB<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, after filtering and cleaning. The paper also provides a detailed description of the filtering process of the dataset, which the GPT-2 paper didn’t.</p>
<p>The authors also attempted to remove any data that overlapped with the train and test sets of the evaluations. Unfortunately, due to a bug, some were missed, so to compensate the paper provides a fairly good analysis of the impact of this leakage.</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf-small.png" alt="Zero-, One-, and Few-shot performance of GPT-3 scaling with parameter count (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The Evaluation section of GPT-3 is very comprehensive, evaluating on a massive battery of NLP tasks in the Zero-shot (given only a natural language description in the generation context), One-shot (a single example in the generation context), or Few-shot (a small handful of examples in the generation context) settings. This setting is worth emphasizing as perhaps one of the biggest differences in ability between GPT-2 and its predecessors, because being able to <em>infer the task</em> from just one or a few examples is a massive step forward in generalization. Whereas previous models all relied on task-specific tuning, GPT-3 can be “tuned” merely by giving it instructions <em>in plain English</em>! In fact, the paper doesn’t even attempt to fine-tune on the target task, leaving that to future work.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> However, one crucial conclusion is that in almost all tests, performance continues to get better with larger models, even across 4 entire orders of magnitude, whereas fine-tuning only improves on one task and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11373.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks catastrophic forgetting and overfitting</a>.</p>
<p>Without going too much into the individual tests, the general result is this: on most tasks, GPT-3 achieves performance significantly worse than fine-tuned SOTA (i.e SuperGLUE, CoQA, Winograd, to name a few), but beating fine-tuned SOTA for some other tasks (i.e PhysicalQA, LAMBADA, Penn Tree Bank). GPT-3 does particularly well on PTB in particular, taking the SOTA perplexity from 35.76 down to 20.5—a massive improvement. GPT-3 can also finally do some arithmetic, something GPT-2 was unable to do well.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/newsgen-small.png" alt="People are unable to separate GPT-3 generated news articles from real ones (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Impressively, and perhaps somewhat alarmingly, people are unable to distinguish GPT-3 generated news stories from real ones, only exacerbating the ethical concerns already raised by GPT-2. The paper analyzes the result of the release of GPT-2, and concludes that the release of GPT-2 has not led to widespread use of LMs for misinformation due to the difficulty of controlling output and variance in output quality, both among low-to-mid skill adversaries and “advanced persistent threats”—adversaries with “high skill and long-term agendas”—such as state actors. However, the paper also acknowledges that with further development, LMs will eventually become advanced enough for these adversaries.</p>
<p>The authors also investigate gender bias in GPT-3, showing that GPT-3 is male leaning; however, the authors claim that some preliminary evidence on the Winogender dataset (which tests coreference resolution on the same sentence but with different gendered pronoun) seems to suggest that larger models are more robust to bias issues. Similar issues appeared for race and religion, with the sentiment of coöccurrent terms varying significantly with race. The authors claim that this issue also got better with the larger models—although, without proper hypothesis testing, it’s difficult to draw any solid conclusions here.</p>

<p>GPT-3 has already been used for a smorgasbord of different applications through the OpenAI API. You can ask it to <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hturan/status/1282261783147958272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code</a>, turn <a href="http://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language commands into shell commands</a>, and simulate <a href="https://www.aiwriter.email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatting with famous people</a>. You can ask it to <a href="https://twitter.com/QasimMunye/status/1278750809094750211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer medical questions</a>, or <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#navy-seal-copypasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write parodies of the navy seal copypasta</a>. You can ask it to <a href="https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/openai-api-alchemy-summarization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summarize passages for second graders</a>, or <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#transformer-poetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write poetry</a>.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember all these are done by the <em>exact same model</em> trained <em>only</em> on modelling text; all that’s different is that it has been “asked nicely” to do different things. These apps showcase the versatility of GPT-3 across many disparate domains—something that, if it were done with GPT-2, would require days or even weeks of extensive data engineering and fine tuning, rather than 15 minutes of prompt crafting. This new paradigm of programming through crafting plain-English prompts, jokingly dubbed <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1273788774422441984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Software 3.0”</a>, has achieved results that are already impressive, but even more impressive when viewed through the lens of <strong>generalization</strong>; GPT-3 wasn’t trained to do any of these things in particular, but it could still be asked<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> to do them, and fairly well at that!</p>

<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Performance continues to scale with compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>But why does GPT-3 matter, if it can’t even beat SOTA across all benchmarks? Why should we care about a model so large that a small computing cluster is necessary even just to run inference at a reasonable speed?</p>
<p>One thing about GPT-3 is that it’s doing reasonably well on tasks it has <em>never even seen</em>, and sometimes tasks not even anticipated by the developers of the model. Additionally, instead of reaching a point of diminishing returns, GPT-3 shows that the trend of larger models performing better continues for at least another order of magnitude, with no signs of stopping. Even though GPT-3 is unwieldy, and even though it still doesn’t quite reach human level performance across the board, GPT-3 shows that it’s <em>possible</em> for a model to someday reach human levels of generalization in NLP—and once the impossible becomes possible, it’s only a matter of time until it becomes practical.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Back when I talked about <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">large Transformer language models like GPT-2, CTRL, and Megatron-LM late last year</a>, I touched briefly on the trend of Language Models getting bigger, and covered some of the issues that simply more compute might not fix. My general anticipation was that the model size arms race would soon be at a temporary standstill, with focus being diverted to better decoding strategies for text generation (perhaps via RL-based methods). I most certainly had not expected that OpenAI would be back at it so soon with such a massive model.</p>
<p>This was such a surprise that I dropped everything to read the paper and work on this post, including a more theory-oriented post that I’ve been working on for a few months now. It will probably be finished <span>soon™</span>, after I recover from GPT-3 shock. Stay tuned! <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2"><p>It’s likely that this was done for easier model parallelism—bigger matrix multiplications are much easier to parallelize than sequentially-applied layers à la <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPipe</a>.</p>
<p>This could have other advantages too, though. After <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EfficientNet</a> came out, I independently ran some experiments of the same concepts to Transformer models, and the result was that for the same amount of compute, wider models had a sizeable advantage over deeper ones—which corroborates the choice here to …</p></li></ol></section></div></div>

		<p>Picking your next professional endeavor ain't easy. There's plenty of advice regarding that on the Internet. Usually, this topic is covered from junior's perspective - how to choose your first job, what to avoid, what kind of questions to ask first, etc. But in fact, it appears that seasoned veterans have similars dilemmas - once in a while some old acquaintance asks me for help in determining the next professional career step:</p><ul><li>which companies (in the area) are worth of interest?</li><li>who offers enough of a challenge so that one could fulfill her/his ambitions?</li><li>where could one elevate her/his game, instead of regressing the skillset?</li></ul><p>Obviously - there's no single answer that would fit everyone. It depends on one's motivations, preferred collaboration model, ambition level, even personal ethics. Nevertheless, I've merged all those questions for the sake of providing the most valuable advice:</p><blockquote>Of all companies (/teams) I've worked for in the last couple of years, which collaborations brought me most satisfaction, fulfillment &amp; ... fun? And what's more important: what was <strong>the single factor</strong> this joint positive impression was mostly dependent on?</blockquote><p>The answer (a single word) may sound surprising, but it came up naturally. Few months ago, I noticed I keep using this word more and more in my daily conversations.</p><p>This word is ...</p><p>Huh? But what do I mean by "clarity"? A "clarity" of what?</p><p>Let's call it <strong>a clarity of "work context"</strong>.</p><p>Which means a joint clarity ...</p><ul><li>... of vision (to follow, aka a strategic perspective)</li><li>... of goals (to achieve) / or problems (to beat, aka a tactical perspective)</li><li>... and of what I'm going to do tomorrow (to have things progressing, aka operational perspective).</li></ul><p>Just to be clear: when I mention "goals", it's NOT just about having some goals listed on a scrap of paper. It's about truly <strong>understanding &amp; embracing</strong> them, so even if (at this point in time) you don't know how to achieve them, you at least have the clarity of how/where to start.</p><p>What happens when ...</p><p><br>People drift. Focus gets lost. Positive energy gets wasted. Chaos lurks underneath. We shift from being paid for meaningful results (because we don't understand/foresee those results) to being paid for "time spent in work" - which is a real motivation &amp; ownership killer.</p><p>In fact, clarity appears to be (in practice) fair compensation for various inconveniences - like dealing with an outdated tech stack or organizational debt (of any kind).</p><p>What could cause clarity to get lost? Lack of transparency (e.g., failing to shape a big picture accessible for everyone), miss-communications, neo-feudal hierarchies (and other kinds of knowledge/control siloes), diverging, inconsistent or too unstable priorities, lack of internal focus &amp; delivery discipline (e.g., shitty prioritization), poor value management (everything is critical!), micro-management with a pathological lack of trust, ... and so it goes.</p><p><br>Paradoxically, these days it isn't easy to find a company w/o a written vision, mission statement or striking strategic goals. Unfortunately, they are usually very poorly defined. Take "digital transformation", which appears in every 2nd company's nearest plans - it's so vague and ambiguous that it practically means NOTHING. Who would die for it? Who would get motivated by "digitally transforming"? To be frank, such statements typically ... reduce the clarity, instead of improving it.</p><p>I strongly believe in individuals taking ownership and being able to make a difference - the initiative can come from anywhere, either from the "bottom" or the "top". However, when it comes to clarity in particular, I find it as majorly leaders' responsibility. It's a part of their professional credibility. What we expect of a leader is:</p><ul><li>to understand where we are</li><li>to know where we're heading</li><li>to have (a visible) confidence we can get there</li><li>to convince everyone else it's feasible and within reach</li></ul><p>There's no excuse - someone w/o clarity AND the ability to "infect" others with that clarity simply can't be a credible leader.</p>

<p>Everywhere I’ve worked, there’s a hidden (and sometimes not-so-hidden) expectation that code constantly get pushed out. Code not being pushed is a red flag. Make sure you take no longer than a week for a Jira ticket or a Github issue. Have you been taking longer than a week? Expect to get pinged on Slack:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>your-friendly-project-manager</strong>: Hey, how’s it going with ABCD-123, need any help?
</p></blockquote>
<p>And, I get it: that’s the PM’s job. But I’m also trying to do <em>my</em> job: not just writing code, but writing <em>good</em> code.</p>
<h2>An AGILE Trojan horse</h2>
<p>If you bring up evaluating programmers based lines-of-code these days, most people agree it’s archaic and ineffective, but lines of code are back, you see: it’s called <em>velocity</em>. “Are you happy with your velocity?” an engineering lead might ask you. “We should work on our velocity…” a product manager might balk.</p>
<p><img src="http://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/velocity.png" alt="Are you happy with your velocity?" width="482" height="401" srcset="https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/velocity.png 482w, https://dvt.name/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/velocity-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px"></p><p>Velocity is another (more polite and trendy) way of essentially evaluating programmers on how much code they write. And this has all the implications you might imagine. “Velocity,” <a href="https://www.scruminc.com/velocity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Scrum Inc.</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Velocity is a measure of the amount of work a Team can tackle during a single Sprint and is the key metric in Scrum. Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed User Stories. […] Velocity is a key feedback mechanism for the Team. It helps them measure whether process changes they make are improving their productivity or hurting it. While a Team’s velocity will oscillate from Sprint to Sprint, over time, a well-functioning Scrum Team’s velocity should steadily trend upward by roughly 10% each Sprint.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can ignore the downright ridiculous idea that efficiency should trend +10% <em>ad infinitum</em>, but level of effort (and therefore the point mechanism) will often involve how much code — and implicitly how difficult — a particular feature might be. What velocity ignores is one key element of writing good code and building good products: <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<h2>Using your brain</h2>
<p>A lot of times, thinking about <em>how</em> to build something is harder and more time consuming than actually building it. This might seem like unnecessary meta-cognition, but it’s not: even before writing a paper, you might need to write up an outline. An outline might turn into a rough draft. After a few edits, the draft turns into the final product. Software is very similar, but that’s not how we build it.</p>
<p>Instead, we build features that are stuck to other features using duct tape and superglue. Sometimes, we have fancy names for shoddy software: we’re building <em>microservices</em>, guy! No one has time for refactoring or cleanup. Unit testing? We’ll throw those in the backlog; they’re not high priority. Inevitably something breaks, a customer complains, and we’re off to the races: who’s on call this week? Good luck.</p>
<p>After more than a decade working at software companies, I’ll be the first to admit that I’m part of the problem. I don’t push back anymore, and I’ve conceded more times that I can count. I <em>know</em> we’re building bad software, but everyone else is doing it, too.</p>
<h2>How much is too much?</h2>
<p>Why is this happening? It’s just too much darn code. Too much code to read over, too much code to review, too many pull requests. It takes <em>time</em> to mull over questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this the best way to do this?</li>
<li>What are the trade-offs between doing it this way or that way?</li>
<li>Should we re-architect part of the code to accommodate this new feature?</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, these questions tend to wax creative, and not technical. But I’ve never seen a Jira ticket entitled “Ponder over proposed architecture” or “Think about better ways one might implement this.” Do the tests look like they’re passing? LGTM, merging ✔️</p>
<p>Don’t just write code quickly; write code <em>well</em>. And please stop writing so much of it.</p>

July 19, 2020 | https://vectorly.io/docs/technology/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vectorly.io/docs/technology/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

<p><img src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/vector-graphics.png" alt="Drawing"></p>

<p>Vectorly is developing a new kind of video compression technology, which uses computer vision and vector graphics to reduce bitrates for video content by an order of magnitude (or more) compared to HEVC, while <strong>improving video</strong> quality. </p>
<p>This would be primarily effective for "vector friendly" video content, which would include animations, screen-casts, many e-learning videos and potentially 3d gaming content. </p>
<p>By leveraging existing vector-graphics rendering capabilities on all devices, this codec wouldn't require end-users, OEMs or browsers to install special software to enable playback of these videos.</p>
<p><strong>We are still in the early phases of developing this technology</strong>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the technology in our <a href="https://files.vectorly.io/Vectorization+Whitepaper+v06.20.pdf">whitepaper</a></p>
<h2 id="the-core-idea">The Core Idea</h2>
<p>The core insight behind this project was that you could use vector-graphics based animations to simulate "videos" in a way that is indistinguishable from a traditional raster-graphics based video format such as an h264 video stream in an MP4 container.</p>
<h3 id="raster-graphics">Raster Graphics</h3>
<p>Normal videos, like the ones you see on Netflix or YouTube, are just sequences of images which get updated quickly on the screen, to create the illusion of motion. Each image is composed of "pixels" - individual dots of color. Higher resolution means more pixels, better visual quality, and bigger file sizes.</p>
<p><img alt="Pixel-Based" src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/pixels.png"></p>
<p>Almost all video on the internet is of this format, known as "raster graphics". Video compression algorithms like h264 are just very efficient at using fewer data-points to reconstruct the pixels in any given frame, and at storing only the differences in pixels between frames of a video. </p>
<h3 id="vector-grapics-video">Vector Grapics video</h3>
<p>In contrast, we use a concept called "vector-graphics" to render video. Instead of pixels, we represent everything on the screen using shapes, lines and curves, which can be represented as mathematical equations (vector graphics).</p>
<p><img alt="Vector-Based" src="https://vectorly.io/docs/img/vector2.png"></p>
<p>Using these mathematical equations, we can re-draw any arbitrary shape on the screen - from the letter "T" to Bart Simpson's head. Furthermore, by adding information such as color, position on the screen, and how they move or change shape over time, you can create whole videos - including entire episodes of the Simpsons, with just sequences of mathematical equations.</p>
<h3 id="why-vectorization">Why vectorization?</h3>
<p>The core insight behind this project was that for a certain kind of "vector-friendly" video content, storing the video using vector graphics would be much more efficient than using raster graphics (in some cases, up to 2 orders of magnitude more efficient).</p>
<p>This idea is not substantively different from the idea of Flash based animations about 20 years ago. Why do this now?</p>
<p><strong>No need for a decoder</strong>: Most devices now support SVG, HTML5, WebGL/OpenGL and/or some form of hardware-accelerated vector-graphics rendering. That lets you render vector-graphics content on any device without require end-users, OEMs or browsers to install special software to enable playback of vector-graphics content, and to achieve native-level performance by doing so. App developers would only need to include an appropriate library or SDK in their website or app to enable playback within native or 3rd player video players.</p>
<p><strong>Computer vision</strong>: Our patented vectorization technology relies heavily on computer vision to convert raster-graphics videos to a vector format. Leveraging the advancement &amp; commoditization of Computer Vision, and the ease of running batch computer-vision heavy tasks on the cloud, it's feasible to 'vectorize' large volumes of video at scale now, in a way that wasn't possible even 5 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="vector-graphics-video-format">Vector graphics video format</h3>
<p>We are building a video-format based on existing standards (SVG, WebGL &amp; OpenGL), extending it with Javascript to enable video features such as a timeline and key-frames. We package the resulting video data within an MP4 container, which can be streamed and distributed using existing video infrastructure (such as HLS/DASH, and DRM systems).</p>

	<p><small>July 19, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've written before (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSameness">here</a>) about how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZFSFileserverSetupIII">our
current Linux ZFS fileservers</a> work much
like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/solaris/ZFSFileserverSetupII">our old OmniOS fileservers</a>.
However, not everything is quite the same between ZFS on Linux and
traditional Solaris/OmniOS ZFS. One of the most welcome differences
for us is <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.4/man8/zed.8.html">ZED</a>,
the ZFS Event Daemon. What ZED does that is so great is that it provides
a very simple way to take action when <a href="https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.4/man5/zfs-events.5.html">ZFS events</a> happen.</p>

<p>When a ZFS event happens, ZED looks through a directory (generally
<code>/etc/zfs/zed.d</code>) to find scripts (or programs) that should be run
in response to the event. Each script is run with a bunch of
environment variables set to describe what's going on, and it can
use those environment variables to figure out what the event is.
ZED decides what things to run based on their names; generally you
wind up with script names like <code>all-cslab.sh</code> (which is run on
all events) and <code>resilver_finish-cslab.sh</code> (which is run when a
resilver finishes).</p>

<p>Because these are just a collection of individual files, you're
free to add your own without colliding with or having to alter the
standard 'ZEDLETs' provided by ZFS on Linux. Your additions can do
anything you want them to, ranging from the simple to the complex.
For instance, our simplest ZEDLET simply syslogs all of the ZED
environment variables:</p>


<blockquote><pre>PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:$PATH
export PATH
if [ "$ZEVENT_SUBCLASS" = "history_event" ]; then
        exit 0
fi
unset ZEVENT_TIME
unset ZEVENT_TIME_STRING
printenv | fgrep 'ZEVENT_' | sort | fmt -999 |
    logger -p daemon.info -t 'cslab-zevents'
exit 0
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(There's a standard 'all-syslog.sh' ZEDLET, but it doesn't syslog
all of the information in the zevents. Capturing all of the information
is especially useful if you want to write additional ZEDLETs and
aren't quite sure what they should look for or what environment
variables have useful information.)</p>

<p>It can take a bit of time and experimentation to sort out what ZFS
events are generated (and with what information available) in
response to various things happening to adn in your ZFS pools. But
once you have figured it out, ZED gives you a way to trigger and
drive all sorts of system management activities. These can be active
(like taking action if devices fail) or passive (like adding markers
in your metrics system or performance dashboards for when ZFS scrubs
or resilvers start and end, so you can correlate this with other
things happening).</p>

<p>Coming from Solaris and OmniOS, where there was no such simple
system for reacting to things happening in your ZFS pools, ZED was
a breath of fresh air for us. More than anything else, it feels
like how ZFS events should have been handled from the start, so
that system administrators could flexibly meet their own local needs
rather than having to accept whatever the Solaris Fault Management
system wanted to give them.</p>

<p>PS: Because ZFS on Linux is now OpenZFS, I believe that ZED will
probably eventually show up in FreeBSD (if it isn't already there).
Perhaps it will even some day be ported back to Illumos.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1998 at my first job, I was the system administrator of the biggest Internet provider in Bolivia, it still is the biggest provider. The Internet arrived here in 1995 or 1996, so it was just starting.</p>

<p>I was in charge of BGP routers, with a satellite connection to the Internet, the whole country had just 2 mbps of connection back in those days. I was also in charge of the email server, (roble.scz.entelnet.bo), the DNS server run on a Unix machine while the email and web server on a RedHat Linux powered PC.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2001, I started my own company, it had nothing to do with system administration, but anyway we needed email service, so I just got an online channel with a /28 public IP segment, and set up a CentOS server running bind, sendmail, Dovecot.</p>

<p>In 2007, I started blogging on Drupal running on that same server using Apache, PHP and MySQL <a href="https://www.garron.me/en/go2linux/fedora-centos-root-password-recovery.html">here the first post</a>. I was used to hosting services.</p>

<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

<p>But then I had less time in my hands, it was also more difficult to maintain the services running, keeping up to date with Spam filters and rules became difficult, Bind also had its problems, and Slashdot happened and Bandwidth was not enough.</p>

<p>I moved my server to a web hosting company, and then to a Linode VPS, I also outsourced the DNS service and moved the email to Google Apps.</p>

<p>I migrated my old server to Debian and used it just for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DHCP</li>
  <li>NAT</li>
  <li>DNS Cache</li>
  <li>Squid</li>
</ul>

<p>That was in 2010 more or less, so I stopped hosting my services, only my blog was in my hands, but at that time I started using Jekyll, so it was just a VPS with Nginx.</p>

<h2 id="back-on-hosting-my-own-services">Back on Hosting my own services</h2>

<p>In April this year I started this blog, but I also enrolled in the Fediverse, and decided to <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/my-own-mastodon-server.html">run my own instance</a>, therefore I was hosting again, that was not just a NGINX server, then I read <a href="https://yarmo.eu/post/selfhost-email">this</a>, <a href="https://yarmo.eu/post/selfhost-email-drawbacks">this</a> and <a href="https://lazybear.io/posts/should-you-sefhost-your-email/">this</a>.</p>

<p>And the idea of running my services was in my head again. I wanted to do it different with time, it is not 1998 anymore, so I decided to learn about <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/dockerize-everything.html">Docker</a>. So now I have in just one Arch Linux server:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two static sites</li>
  <li>One Wordpress Site</li>
  <li>One RSS reader (Miniflux)</li>
  <li>One password manager app (Bitwarden)</li>
  <li>One read-later app (<a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/wallabag-review.html">Wallabag</a>)</li>
  <li>One Webmention app <a href="https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/06/14/setting-up-webmentiond/">Webmentiod</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All running with Docker Compose files, but there was something missing, it was email. (Mastodon has its own server -yet-)</p>

<h2 id="hosting-your-own-email-server">Hosting your own email server</h2>

<p>I wanted to run an email server on Docker, so I looked for alternatives and I have found that there are some really nice.</p>

<h3 id="posteiohttpsposteio"><a href="https://poste.io/">Poste.io</a></h3>

<p>I have not tested it, but seems really easy to deploy it has a free version that I think is enough for personal use, with two professional options with a monthly charge.</p>

<h3 id="mailuiohttpsmailuio"><a href="https://mailu.io/">Mailu.io</a></h3>

<p>It is a clone of Poste.io, but using only free, Open Source alternatives, I have installed and configured, it took me just 45 minutes to have server running for one of my domains. It has a tool that create a configuration file based on your options, and it set up everything for you, you can find it <a href="https://setup.mailu.io/1.7/">here</a>, you only need to answer a few questions, and run three or four commands and there you have a complete email server.</p>

<ul>
  <li>SMTP</li>
  <li>IMAP</li>
  <li>POP3</li>
  <li>AntiSpam</li>
  <li>AntiVirus</li>
  <li>Webmail</li>
  <li>Admin web front-end</li>
</ul>

<p>Really a great option, I recommend it to anyone.</p>

<h3 id="docker-mail-serverhttpshubdockercomrtvialdocker-mailserver"><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tvial/docker-mailserver">Docker Mail Server</a></h3>

<p>Then I found this one, it is also a complete suite, all Open Source, with excellent documentation, and ready to deploy on a server with Docker. It is not as easy as Mailu, but I decided to use it. I followed <a href="https://github.com/tomav/docker-mailserver/wiki/Installation-examples">this guide</a>, yes I know, you still need Gmail or any other provider to send your emails, if you follow that guide. But I was not ready to jump into the pool completely.</p>

<p>So, here is my setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MX record points to my server, so all my email is received by my server</li>
  <li>All email is then forwarded to other accounts (Gmail accounts in this case)</li>
  <li>Gmail is configured to use those accounts as default and not the Gmail address, and uses my SMTP server to send</li>
</ul>

<p>This way I am sure I am using my domain, because we already agreed that <a href="https://www.garron.blog/posts/own-your-domain.html">everybody should own his domain</a>, right?. I am using Gmail as my email client.</p>

<p>I am doing this way, because it is easy to search emails when they are with Gmail, also because I am not sure if I may lose my server and lose some important email. I need to be sure about that, because I am hosting for my family, not only for me.</p>

<p>Also having an IMAP client on a cell phone drains the battery, because it polls the server even when there is nothing to download, or if you keep an open IMAP IDLE connection, it will also drain the battery. There is a solution for that, you need <a href="https://pushover.net/">PushOver</a>, and this <a href="https://pushover.net/">IMAP to PushOver</a> app, I have not tested yet, but I think is the way to go.</p>

<p>Edit: After reading some comments on Reddit, these three other options seems to be good ones too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mailcow.email/">MailCow</a>: Is another good option also mentioned on HN comments, and this one do have official Docker documentation <a href="https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://mailinabox.email/">Mail in a Box</a>: Although there are not official instructions to install it on Docker, it should be possible, here is an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mtrnord/mailinabox/">outdated attempt</a>, and here <a href="https://discourse.mailinabox.email/t/mail-in-a-box-in-docker/4588">another one</a>. But on a VPS it seems work great, and the admin pannel guides you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://iredmail.org/">iRedMail</a>: This one is also a good option, I have tested it two months ago for a week and also works out of the box, you can find a well maintained docker instructions <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lejmr/iredmail">here</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>

<p>If you plan to host your own email server, there are some important things you need to consider, and it is to properly configure your DNS server. Here is what you need:</p>

<h3 id="spf-record">SPF record</h3>

<p>You really need to configure a SPF record, it is not the same with all providers, but there is plenty of documentation, and it is not hard to do. This record basically tells the recipient server who is authorized to send mail on behalf of your domain. The most common configuration is that the MX server are the authorized ones, something like this.</p>

<pre><code>v=spf1 mx ~all
</code></pre>

<h3 id="dkim-record">DKIM record</h3>

<p>This one is a little more difficult, you need to create the DKIM key, your email server may do it, all examples above can do it, once you have it, you need to create a TXT record on your DNS and paste it there, it will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEArARSBHTh32y3VpSEe+pOI7AuILCUsYw1FNL5vTu1P3Mpte50jjkvzg+pBndcSzndQDt6B6mqLBbTwWrZR/j73CTI4ejcYL+xqSXYPU8+xNwu5uwHOMsgWMl15Z/1e1QJD9Ss3Q8aOLOkvHNIgAfSCq
</code></pre>

<p>All your emails will be signed with that, DKIM key, and the receiving server can check if the signature is valid, using the info from the DNS.</p>

<h3 id="dmarc-record">DMARC record</h3>

<p>This one is optional, but is better to have it, you can generate it using online tools like <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARCRecordGenerator.aspx">this one</a>. What it does is to tell what to do when something fails, and who to report that, usually the server admin, well you.</p>

<h3 id="ptr-record">PTR Record</h3>

<p>You need to have a PTR DNS records, that is the reverse DNS for the IP your server is using should point to the same name the A record has. So, for example, if you have this A record</p>

<pre><code>IN A mail.server.com 192.168.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>There should also be a reverse record like this.</p>

<pre><code>IN PTR 192.168.0.1 mail.server.com
</code></pre>

<p>You need to ask to the owner of the IP to add that record for you, if you are using a VPS, you can look in the documentation about that.</p>

<h3 id="mx-record">MX record</h3>

<p>Of course, you need a MX record, but you already knew about this one, otherwise maybe is not a good idea to run your own server. This basically informs al sending servers which server is receiving email for your domain.</p>

<h3 id="test">Test</h3>

<p>Once you have set up everything, wait 24 hours for DNS to propagate and test it, <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/">this tool</a> is great</p>

<h3 id="secondary-mail-server">Secondary mail server</h3>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>After reading <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iatbst/how_self_host_your_email_server#c_hc7vvv">this comment</a>, I want to add this recommendation too.</p>

<p>When the main server is down, email can not be delivered, usually it just stays in the senders queue, and once your server is up again all email is delivered to it, but if the outage is long enough some email might be returned to senders and the users will lose them.</p>

<p>The way to avoid this is to have a second machine running a secondary email server, this is simpler to set up, as it will only have the function to store email while the main server is down, and send all emails to it once is up again. There are some good documentation out there, <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/postfix_backup_mx">here</a> and <a href="https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/how-to-set-up-a-backup-email-server-postfix-ubuntu">here</a>.</p>

<p>The drawback is that now you have a second email to upgrade and keep running, and Spammers usually target at it, so if you have backups for the main server, and you consider you can have it up and running relatively fast you can avoid a second email. One should also consider whose email is being hosted at the server, and how critical is that email for them.</p>

<p>Critical email might be on an Office 365 <strong>Exchange Online (Plan 1)</strong>, once again, under your domain.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>

<p>You may not need to host your email server, you can use <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/es-xl/mail/">Zoho</a>, Office 365, or Google Suite, but you <strong>must</strong> use your domain, all accounts, all bank statements should be sent to an email address at your domain, otherwise you can lose control over your accounts. Hosting your email server is not an easy task, dealing with SPAM is hard, and downtimes can be a nightmare too, but you learn one or two things while hosting your email.</p>

<p>I had a brief run with a startup (literally a month) and was faced with the decision of going into a YC Cohort. In that fiasco, I also spent at least twelve hours trying to convince other people to go. It's been half a year, and I've had a lot more time to reflect on reasons as to why one might want to run a startup. As you might've guessed, I decided not to do it and I genuinely believe that running a startup seems like a bad idea for the majority of people I meet who want to become founders. </p>
<p>This post definitely will not apply to everyone (I'd loosely say applicable to 80% of prospective startup founders), but I'd hope there's some valuable thinking in here. Also, note that this is fairly oriented towards technical founders. </p>
<p>Edit: This post also has a very limited scope as it's based off the thinking from my decision to continue interning at Shopify or to go to YC. It's very focused on the Silicon Valley "startup" where you get a VC to give you money and get big in a year, etc etc</p>

<h3 id="commitment">Commitment<a href="#commitment" aria-label="Anchor link for: commitment"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I'm not talking about commitment to your company. I'm talking about commitment to your cofounder (if you have one, which is likely). </p>
<p>Maybe I'm too young to understand, but marriage seems frightening! My finances, my social life, personal time, and emotional wellbeing would be largely dependent on a single person and that's scary. It should be scary or should at least take a few years for it not to become scary. </p>
<p>Your cofounder is...kind of the same? In a seed-stage it's likely you <em>actually</em> live together, and if you don't, you're likely functionally living together with the amount of work involved. They're responsible for your financial well-being. They may be responsible for the quality of your social lives (most founders spend a lot of time socializing with other tech people + founders). They're tied to your life goals, your dreams, and your passions.</p>
<p>My impression was that my relationship with my cofounder would be more intense than marriage, and <em>extra</em> bad in the event of failure since there's additional loss (and it's statistically likely, but I guess so is marriage). I totally believe that there are cofounder pairs that are completely ready to go through the founder journey and pairs that maybe weren't ready but were fine anyway, but I stand by the statement that it's more intense than marriage and not enough people put care into this. </p>
<h3 id="your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here">Your VC is Not the One at Risk Here<a href="#your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here" aria-label="Anchor link for: your-vc-is-not-the-one-at-risk-here"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I often hear sentiments that resemble "wow these VCs are taking a chance on me I better commit to this!". </p>
<p>VCs are not evil people trying to take advantage of you (actually they might be, but let's assume they're not), but they are not the ones at risk. For them, 150k or a few million is not a huge risk. Seed-stage returns will be from a very small percentage of investments, thus VCs can afford to have comically high error rates as long as they get the few that matter. If you're SoftBank you can do even worse and still have so much money! They make decisions carefully, they care about your success for various reasons, and are generally caring people (in most of my experiences) but in larger abstractions, your startup means nothing to them. </p>
<p>They're not shy about it either, the entire reason they're investing in you is because they think you're more valuable than you cost. 
<img src="https://carolchen.me/blog/img/founding/paul.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Your risk is years of your life, blood, sweat, and tears. The next few years (provided your startup lasts till then) will somewhat be in service to these VCs. The VCs are your "bosses" as you answer to them (though <em>much</em> less than a regular "boss") and to the ones you hope to raise capital from in the future. </p>
<p>It's good to take a risk with increased confidence because qualified people think you have promise. However, that can morph into "I'm going to work on this startup partially in service to these people who believed in me and gave me lots of money". These additional stresses that come from meeting VC expectations and the complications of the dynamics of the relationship can cause various problems.</p>
<h3 id="sense-of-self">Sense of Self<a href="#sense-of-self" aria-label="Anchor link for: sense-of-self"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This one is the one that got to me most but I can see it being irrelevant to a lot of other people. </p>
<p>Many founders have big egos -- I don't mean they're assholes or overly self-important but they do have very powerful confidence, because that's a valuable skill to have as a founder. Not just confidence in pitching their project to others, but in their vision and their company. They need to believe their company will be successful (though I have met founders who just want to party with VC money for a few years <em>cough cough</em> Neumann). </p>
<p>My first fear was that I created an ego for myself rapidly. Practicing to sell to clients and for your YC interview involves repeating to yourself why you are <em>good</em> and self-hypnosis is fairly powerful. I love feeling good about myself, but I suddenly found myself feeling more confident in myself than what I believed was warranted. More frighteningly, I had a major character and energy change in a couple of weeks. Losing so much of my identity like that was unnerving, not to mention the ripple effects that could've occurred in my social life. </p>
<p>The other fear is coming down from that. Startup founders (especially the more eccentric ones) sometimes believe that they will build something that will change the world. Along with that, their identities start to merge with their company. There's nothing wrong with that, but I also think it's exceptionally tragic to come down from that. It's not just dealing with failure and getting back up on your feet, it's losing a part of your identity. </p>

</h3>
<p>Being a good engineer seems underrated for being a good startup founder. Not just being able to code fast, but being able to make good engineering decisions, conduct good technical interviews and attract talent. Some engineering skills can't be worked around with "I am very smart and can learn fast" and require extended time and practice. With that, I also think prospective founders also overestimate the amount of learning on the job that can be done on the engineering side, mostly because it's harder to learn when you're in a rush to release features than if you could take your time on a course project. It's true that founders will learn more than they will in school, but the technical development may not be as strong. My model is that the best schooling experience is better technical education and the best founding experience. </p>

<p>Lots of huge, ground-breaking products have been lead from within a large company. Examples include email client <code>hey.com</code>, Chromebooks, and countless amazing dev tools. </p>
<p>Starting these things in a large company has the benefit of security, resources and recruiting already done for you. Downsides include beaurocracy, not being able to recruit on your own accord and dealing with PR policy. There is also high barriers to starting something within a company, like being senior enough to do so and being at the right company at the right time. </p>
<p>The alternative is starting a project on the side. <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig">Ziglang</a> was started as a side project and is now a very promising programming language. The creator has since then left his job to work on Zig, but it is also possible to "own" something significant without even having to leave your job. Examples includes Julia Evan's <a href="https://jvns.ca/">blog</a> (not actually a work-side-project) and line of zines, Cassidy William's <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-dsa-astrolokeys-keycaps-by-sailorhg-and-cassidoo">keycap line</a>, Nick Frosst's successful and awesome <a href="https://goodkidofficial.com/">band</a> and many more. I understand that it's not the extent of "oh yeah Google? I built that", but I think the expected value is much higher in creating and owning something that isn't a startup. </p>
<h3 id="getting-rich">Getting Rich<a href="#getting-rich" aria-label="Anchor link for: getting-rich"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A lot of people claim that startups are less money, but I find for signicant number of founders, that's not true -- not because they'll definitely have a good exit, but because they're skilled in ways that allow them to raise enough money to pay themselves like they would at a big company. If that applies to you, then going to a startup probably is your best shot at getting rich! For other people, the expected value of industry (particularly joining a well-founded early-stage startup) is usually higher. </p>

</h3>
<p>This seems like a valid reasons for the average CS student. School is a place where you answer to professors who don't always understand industry and do homework assignments that no one will care about. However, it seems like all of these problems can be significantly if not fully solved by building a better school experience for yourself. </p>
<p>A better program can improve many things, such as <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin College of Engineering</a> that has a project-based curriculum, <a href="https://www.makeschool.com/">Make School</a> that is a two year applied-engineering degree program or <a href="https://devdegree.ca/">Dev Degree</a>, where you can work at Shopify and take more applied courses taught by Shopify throughout your degree. These programs are small and selective, but probably not harder than a semi-successful startup. Dev Degree also happens to be more financially sound, with Shopify paying for your tuition and a salary, and Make School tuition is 70k for the entire degree. </p>
<p>Another alternative is to just be worse at school and learn on the side and/or to morph your silly school assignments into productive skills and useful outputs. The <a href="http://coconut-lang.org/">Coconut Programming Language</a> was built by someone while they were in school. Some things like dynamic programming that are often deemed useless theoretical things can have <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/06/17/tree-diffing/">industry applications</a>. People have also taken mundane school projects like this compiler that almost every school will have you build in a compilers course and end up with <a href="https://thume.ca/2019/04/29/comparing-compilers-in-rust-haskell-c-and-python/">educational findings for engineers in general</a> (also see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20192645">HackerNews thread</a>). In five weeks, my friend Maas was able to launch <a href="https://medium.com/@maaslalani/launch-5d02cc5e05f5">five relatively successful products</a> while enrolled in Dev Degree. </p>
<p>School is already a powerful environment of hardwork, fun and learning. I think it is a more cohesive …</p></section></article></main></div>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth. Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1259084270854905856">link</a> after <a href="https://www.longevity.vc/">link</a> after <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15174-3">link</a> after <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/11/researchers-able-to-improve-reverse-age-related-diseases-in-mice/">link</a> on the topic.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Six years ago, a lifetime in the aging field, the mere suggestion that aging could be reversed was enough to have your colleagues &amp; donors screw up their noses.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>OTTAWA -- 
	As U.S. members of Congress push Canada to reopen its shared border with the United States, Canadians are pushing back — both in government and on social media.</p>
<p>
	In an <a href="https://higgins.house.gov/sites/higgins.house.gov/files/6-3-20%20NORTHERN%20BORDER%20LETTER.pdf">open letter</a> addressed to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, 29 bipartisan members of Congress called on the Canadian government to plan a phased reopening of the Canada-U.S. border and to consider easing existing measures.</p>
<p>
	"We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions," read the letter, which was published on Western New York Congressman Brian Higgins' website on July 3.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank"><strong>Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The members of Congress, who represent the northern states along the border, also implored the Canadian government to consider easing restrictions on family members and property owners impeded by the border closure.</p>
<p>
	"We understand the importance of prioritizing the safety of our communities as we all navigate the complex calculation of minimizing public health risks and resuming economic activity. However, the social and economic partnership between our two nations necessitates a clear pathway forward," the letter read.</p>
<p>
	They crafted the letter following the latest joint Canada-U.S. agreement to extend the current border closure until July 21. This is the third time the agreement to maintain the border closure has been extended.</p>
<p>
	Despite the United States' plea, a spokesperson for Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTVNews.ca in a Friday statement that the health and safety of Canadians is "absolutely priority."</p>
<p>
	"Decisions about Canada's border are made by Canadians, for Canadians," said Freeland's spokesperson, Katherine Cuplinskas, in the statement.</p>
<p>
	"Since the beginning of this global pandemic, we have been having friendly ongoing conversations with our American partners about our shared border. Both sides agree that the current measures in place, which are set to expire on July 21st, have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded."</p>
<p>
	Freeland's office wasn’t alone in pushing back against the call. Higgins posted the open letter in full <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrianHiggins/status/1279120917134741505">on his Twitter page</a> and he was swiftly met with backlash on the social media platform.</p>
<p>
	One comment, which had three times as many likes as Higgins' original post, slammed the call.</p>
<p>
	"No thank you...clean up your backyard before you attempt to enter ours..sincerely Canada," <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelletypoQ/status/1280674509821894657">wrote</a> a user who goes by the name @MichelletypoQ.</p>
<p>
	Another user, @rachelinTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelinTO/status/1281404365954260993">wrote</a> that "most of our earliest cases came from the U.S. So...... that's a firm 'no'. Sorry, eh."</p>
<p>
	Other users called the request "disastrous" and multiple accounts said they’d only be comfortable easing restrictions after seeing improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S.</p>
<p>
	The United States reached a macabre milestone at the end of June when it became home to the world’s highest number of reported infections: more than 2.2 million. It also has the highest death toll in the world, with 120,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>
	Shortly after the news broke about the soaring cases in the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government was considering next steps for the looming deadline of the current border closure.</p>
<p>
	Speaking in a press conference on June 29, with just over three weeks until the agreement expires, he said the government will continue to assess the situation at our shared border.</p>
<p>
	"We have extended the border measures with the United States until July 21. We will continue to assess the situation and work with the Americans on what steps need to be taken into the month of August," Trudeau said.</p>
<p>
	And as COVID-19 continues to affect countries around the world, Trudeau said the health of Canadians remains the top priority when considering the loosening of any border restrictions.</p>
<p>
	"We are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders," Trudeau said.</p>
