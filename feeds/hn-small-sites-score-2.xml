I recommend you read it through the lens of “recommending Anki to a friend.” This article is about the problems of giving advice on how to learn.</p>
<h2>Spreading the “gospel” to the world</h2>
<p>If you deeply believe something, along the lines of “if everyone did it, the world would be much better off.” and have tried convincing other people to do that thing, then you will realize it’s almost impossible to change others’ opinions or behaviors.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re not that ambitious to convince everyone, so you start small: you share it with your friends, but then discovered nobody actually cares or realizes its significance. A mild version is like <a href="https://www.deathbulge.com/comics/206">showing your favorite TV show and they don’t care</a>:</p>

<p>My faith in evidence-based learning strategies is informed by my personal experience and <a href="https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2020-02-25-how-to-learn-about-meta-learning-my-resource-list">my meta-learning list</a>. I wholeheartedly believe Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) like SuperMemo and Anki is the key to effective and efficient learning. If you believe education is the future, then the knowledge about evidence-based learning strategies is one big key to unlocking that future, both individually and collectively.</p>
<h2>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</h2>
<p>Two years ago I was doing my Anki reps. One friend glanced over and was interested in what I was doing.</p>

<p>We ate lunch together while I was giving her a little presentation. I talked <em>very enthusiastically</em> about spaced repetition, basic memory science and Anki operations. Of course I had to show her the infamous forgetting curve:</p>

<p>She sounded excited about the possibility of finally mastering a second language. But at one point she was confused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I hadn’t learned it how could I recall it from memory?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I explained that assessment <strong>for</strong> learning (testing as a means of learning) is different from assessment <strong>of</strong> learning (finding out what you’ve learned). The act of “recalling from memory” is itself a learning process. Then I was aware that her confusion was probably due to a common misconception about memory: human memory works like computer memory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The functional architecture of how humans forget, remember, and learn is <strong>unlike</strong> the corresponding processes in man-made devices […] We think of ourselves as working like computers, we become prone to assuming that exposing ourselves to information and procedures will lead to storage (i.e., recording) of such information or procedures in our memories—that the information will write itself in one’s memory.</p>
<p>If we think of human memory equals to memory in a computer, we are unlikely to appreciate that retrieving information from our memory increases the subsequent accessibility of that information, while retrieving information from computer memory leaves the status of that information unperturbed. <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203842539/chapters/10.4324%2F9780203842539-6">On the Symbiosis of Remembering, Forgetting, and Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Side note: this story might give you the impression that I liked to show off what I know. No not really. I like to be convinced with evidence, and I thought others were the same. I was wrong. Also, I included the above quotes for the sake of convincing you, the reader. I didn’t obfuscate the subject matter further with phrases like assessment <strong>for</strong> learning and assessment <strong>of</strong> learning.</p>
<p>She looked… befuddled. Sort of like this:</p>

<p>I remember I was so excited and nervous at the same time that I was fumbling for words, trying to simplify it as much as I could. In retrospect, I was making things worse.</p>
<p>She’d listen to me quite intently, signaling that she was thinking and trying to figure it out, but I could tell she was still confused. And the more I explained, the deeper the rabbit hole went (like keep clicking hyperlinks in Wikipedia), and the more confused she became, so I stopped talking to stop making the whole situation uncomfortable. The following monologue is how I imagine what she was thinking at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He’s so passionate about this stuff and so sure of himself that I guess he’s right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not really sure what he means. I do want to learn Japanese but the stuff he’s talking about is so confusing…”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was indeed interested in the beginning, but I don’t really care at this point. I’m just going to pretend I understand and end this whole conversation asap.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will never forget what she said at one point,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doing this every day seems very tiring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was like “Yeah…” I never followed up on her progress. I figured if she was truly interested, when she bumped into problem she would ask for my help. As expected, we never talked about it and I never mentioned Anki again.</p>

<p>These has happened countless times. I usually look nonchalant on the outside but dying on the inside. People looked interested (probably due to my enthusiasm and it’s impolite to look otherwise) and then never actually bothered to use Anki. Some would actually try, make a few cards, do the reps for a few days and then say, “I tried and Anki doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>I’m probably over my head, but sometimes it feels like I’m personally attacked, that what I’m saying is not valuable. I understand it’s not true, but it took me years to study the learning science and to gain the experience with Anki/SuperMemo. The fact that they’re dismissing the software feels like they’re dismissing my knowledge and experience.</p>
<h2>The problems of giving advice on how to learn</h2>
<h3>#1. Nobody cares <em>that</em> much, alright?</h3>
<p>When I first discovered Anki I was like, “How come no one around me knows this?! I need to share this to everyone!” So I would tell my friends about Anki but nobody was interested. I’ve introduced Anki to people and every time it’s a very frustrating experience. (Surprise surprise, not SuperMemo. The learning curve of Anki is much lower. What chance do I have if I preached SuperMemo when they even think Anki is too hard to use?)</p>
<p>Update: I was never a missionary and randomly went out my way to tell people about Anki all the time like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://thejenkinscomic.wordpress.com/">Source</a></p>
<p>Very early on I did give unsolicited advice once to my best friend by intentionally bringing up Anki. Then I did bring up Anki on multiple occasions, but only when the opportunity presented itself, like the story above.</p>
<p>People may be interested in how you’ve developed a skill or become fluent in a foreign language, but just not <strong>that</strong> interested. And they certainly don’t expect to be suddenly lectured on how learning and memory work.</p>
<p>I never liked following up to people with questions like “So how’s Anki? Have you used it?” It feels like pushing an agenda to them. Also, since most would not even bother buying and downloading the app, their response is usually, “I forgot about it. I’ll do it later.” and the conversation would end in an awkward tone.</p>
<h3>#2. I’m not sure if I actually want it, alright?</h3>
<p>Sometimes people keep lamenting “I want to learn X or I want to get better grades.” How many times do you hear people say they want to learn a second language? This is like that friend who keeps saying “I want to lose weight”. Probably after all, they’re just lamenting and not yet ready to put in the effort to change.</p>
<p>Trying to convince others to use Anki/SuperMemo is like trying to convince your friends to go to the gym regularly. You can talk about the benefits of exercising/weight-lifting, how good you’ll feel afterwards, how much more productive you’ll be and so on. But nothing will work if they don’t try it in the first place, and it doesn’t help that spaced repetition doesn’t work in the short-term since using Spaced Repetition Software is a life-long pursuit (just as learning is):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This long term focus may explain why explicit spaced repetition is an uncommon studying technique: the pay-off is distant &amp; counterintuitive, the cost of self-control near &amp; vivid. <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Gwern’s Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>#3. Why are you so hyped about it?</h3>
<p>It’s rare if people could understand and realize the significance and application of Spaced Repetition Software in a casual 10-min chat. It’s not about the complexity (it’s not rocket science after all), but rather it’s about awareness: problems with current learning approaches and how Anki/SuperMemo could solve the problems. In other words, if I don’t see the problems, why bother changing?</p>
<p>I have a friend who was learning German. She copied German vocabulary on one side and the equivalent English on the other in a notebook. I showed her my Korean Anki cards: “Take a look at these beautiful images! Gifs! Sentence cards! Audio clips! Mass Immersion Approach! (Former: All Japanese All The Time (AJATT)), Stephen Krashen’s Input Hypothesis!” Then I had another friend who was studying to become a nurse. I told him about Anki: “Image occlusion for anatomy!” It felt wrong of me to be hiding Anki (<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155">Image Occlusion</a> to be specific) from him. Deep down I want to shove their faces to this table:</p>

<p>I was exaggerating but you get the point: it’s not possible to convey the significance and application of it all in a casual 10-min chat. With the benefit of hindsight, all my attempts could’ve been a lot better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I was so convinced and have so much faith in Spaced Repetition Software that I came off as condescending, giving off the impression like “you don’t know how to study; let me teach you.”</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the bold claims: “You’ll get 2x results with half the study time.” (How many are really true whenever you hear such claim?)</li>
<li>Maybe it’s the situation: all he or she wants is someone to listen about the difficulty of studying, not some real advice or suggestions.</li>

        We are going to skip instructing you on how to add your files for commit in this explanation.
        Let's assume you already know how to do that. If you don't, go read some other tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretend that you already have your files staged for commit and enter <span>git commit</span>
        as many times as you like in the terminal box.

    <div id="ExplainGitTag-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git tag name</span> will create a new tag named "name".
        Creating tags just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags can be deleted using the command <span>git tag -d name</span> (coming soon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span> and <span>git tag</span> commands
        to your hearts desire until you understand this concept.

    <div id="ExplainGitBranch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git branch name</span> will create a new branch named "name".
        Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit.

        Branches can be deleted using the command <span>git branch -d name</span>.

    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git checkout</span> has many uses,
        but the main one is to switch between branches.<br>
        For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch,
        I would type <span>git checkout dev</span>.
        After that, if I do a git commit, notice where it goes. Try it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. Try it.<br>
        Make a new commit and then type <span>git checkout bb92e0e</span>
        and see what happens.

      <p>
        Type <span>git commit</span>, <span>git branch</span>,
        and <span>git checkout</span> commands to your hearts desire
        until you understand this concept.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitCheckout-b-Container">
      <p>
        You can combine <span>git branch</span> and <span>git checkout</span>
        into a single command by typing <span>git checkout -b branchname</span>.
        This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitReset-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git reset</span> will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever
        you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit
        that you no longer need.
      </p>
      <p>
        This command is normally used with one of three flags: "--soft", "--mixed", and "--hard".
        The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after
        you reset, and you can read about it <a href="http://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html">here</a>.
        Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the "--hard" flag will work
        on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ref "HEAD^" is usually used together with this command. "HEAD^" means "the commit right
        before HEAD. "HEAD^^" means "two commits before HEAD", and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you must <b>never</b> use <span>git reset</span> to abandon commits
        that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository
        to become out of sync with the origin. Don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRevert-Container">
      <p>
        To undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the
        <span>git reset</span> command. Instead, we have to use <span>git revert</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>git revert</span> will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that
        was done in the commit you want to revert.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitMerge-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git merge</span> will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting
        commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a "fast-forward" method merge.<br>
        To see this happen, checkout the 'ff' branch and then type <span>git merge dev</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitRebase-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git rebase</span> will take the commits on this branch and "move" them so that their
        new "base" is at the point you specify.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should pay close attention to the commit IDs of the circles as they move when you do this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I put "move" in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with
        completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason,
        you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetch-Container">
      <p>
        <span>git fetch</span> will update all of the "remote tracking branches" in your local repository.
        Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPull-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git pull</span> is a two step process that first does a <span>git fetch</span>,
        and then does a <span>git merge</span> of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch.
        If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the argument "--rebase" was given by typing <span>git pull --rebase</span>, the second step of
        pull process will be a rebase instead of a merge. This can be set to the default behavior by configuration by typing:
        <span>git config branch.BRANCHNAME.rebase true</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitPush-Container">
      <p>
        A <span>git push</span> will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch
        on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between
        your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then
        you will be able to push again.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitClean-Container">
      <p>
        One simple example of the use of <span>git reset</span> is to completely restore your local repository
        state to that of the origin.<br>
        You can do so by typing <span>git reset origin/master</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this won't delete untracked files, you will have to delete those separately with
        the command <span>git clean -df</span>.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div id="ExplainGitFetchRebase-Container">
      <p>
        Below is a situation in which you are working in a local branch that is all your own. You want to receive the latest code
        from the origin server's master branch. To update your local branch, you can do it without having to switch branches!
      </p>
      <p>
        First do a <span>git fetch</span>, then type <span>git rebase origin/master</span>!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Lisa Carr never thought her work would lead to armed threats, a firebombing, a shooting and a conspiracy to kill her.</p>
<p>
	The Carr Law office is in a nondescript strip mall in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. It’s closed now, after the litigation lawyer says police told her they could no longer protect her.</p>
<p>
	She was shuttled to another country where she spent five long months in hiding. Carr has never before told her story, but agreed to meet for an interview as part of a W5 investigation into the shady underbelly of an industry that forced her to give up her business and almost cost her, her life: The tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	Over the last number of years, criminal elements have been battling for lucrative control of the major highways around the Toronto area. It has resulted in more than 50 arsons, multiple shootings and at least four murders.</p>
<p>
	So why is there so much violence over a couple of hundred-dollar tows at the side of the road? Because that one tow can net tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>
	Here’s how it works: The tow truck driver gets a kickback from an unscrupulous auto body shop, which then submits wildly inflated repair fees to an insurance company.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="york police" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954903!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	The insurance industry estimates that fake repair bills tally up to $2 billion a year in Canada. And that’s why Carr was in the crosshairs. She was hired by an insurance company to challenge bogus claims.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of a number of months, Carr’s law firm was the target of increasingly violent attacks. First a firebombing and then her office was set on fire.</p>
<p>
	Months later, in broad daylight, a colleague leaving work had a gun put to her head and was told, “Stop suing our friends.” Shortly after that, again in broad daylight, someone opened fire through the front door of the busy office.</p>
<p>
	Carr says it is incredible no one was struck by the flurry of bullets.</p>
<p>
	“I looked down the hall and I saw my receptionist on her hands and knees surrounded by glass. And one of the other girls came running at me saying, ‘Shots fired, shots fired. Call 911.’”</p>
<p>
	While the violence surrounding the tow truck industry has made headlines in the Greater Toronto Area, the story that has never been told is that York Regional Police (YRP) uncovered a plot to kill Carr.</p>
<p>
	It was such a credible threat that they gave her an hour to pack up her belongings and leave her home. Carr and her husband were then whisked out of the country and spent five months in hiding.</p>
<p>
	Three separate police services – YRP, Toronto Police Service and Ontario Provincial Police – joined forces to launch Project Platinum to investigate the violence associated with the tow truck industry.</p>
<p>
	They carried out a series of raids this past spring, which netted dozens of high-powered weapons and led to the arrests of 35 people who face almost 500 charges, including the attempted murder of Carr.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="weapon" src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4954983!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_960/image.jpg"></p>
<p>
	Now back in Canada, Carr says police have told her she is likely no longer in danger, but with one caveat.</p>
<p>
	“The police said we believe the risk is low. As long as you don't go back to work, as long as you don't restart the firm,” she says.</p>
<p>
	“So they have effectively ended my career. We lost everything. They won.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
Vectorization is when you take some minecraft-style raster image and make a crisp vector picture out of it.
    </p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg">
    
    <p>
It's especially useful when you want to turn a satellite photo into a map. Or if you want to scan some blueprint and turn it into a CAD model. Or if you want to reissue an old game and you don't want to redraw all the artwork from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
The algorithm I'm going to show you has nothing to do with all these things. It's a basic vectorization technique which, in its original form, has little to none applications in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
On the plus side, it illustrates the approach rather well. It shows how things like bilinear interpolation, gradient descent, and parametric splines work together to solve a real-world problem. At the very least, it makes learning about all these things a little more compelling.
    </p>

    <h2>
An input image
    </h2>
    <p>
A raster image is essentially a rectangular table of things. If it's a full-color RGB, then it's a table of color pixels. Color pixels are the triplets of 8-bit integer values where each value represents an amount of red, green, and blue color.
    </p>
    <p>
Medical images, such as obtained from computed tomography, are usually the tables of 12-bit or 16-bit integers. It's not a color really since the values come from invisible X-ray radiation, but they are called gray values nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
Satellite images may have a lot of channels. Apart from the colors of the visible specter they may contain ultra-violet and infra-red luminosity. Channels may be represented by integers or floating point values.
    </p>
    <p>
Our image will be a simple gray-scale bitmap.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Technically, we can already turn it into vectors rather easily. Let's just agree on some threshold, and mark the contour of all the pixels that have the values exceeding this threshold.
    </p>
    <canvas id="greyscale_canvas_contour" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Well, it's simple, but it's not what we wanted. We want curves, not corners. And for that, we have to make our image less cornery.
    </p>
    <h2>
<span id="index_image_interpolation">Image interpolation</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's say our image is not a table of values. Let's say we only know the values in the centers of the pixels, and we have to guess the values between them somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
This is called interpolation. The simplest case would be the nearest neighbor interpolation, where for every point on an image, the value is the value from the nearest pixel's center. But this simply turns it back into a table.
    </p>
    <p>
A little more advanced is the <span id="index_bilinear_interpolation">bilinear interpolation</span>. The value is the linear sum of the four neighboring values. It looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_1">// pixel value with out of bounds checks
function pixel_in(pixels, i, j) {
    if(i &gt;= pixels.length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, pixels.length-1, j);
    if(i &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, 0, j);
    if(j &gt;= pixels[0].length)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, pixels[0].length-1);
    if(j &lt; 0)
        return pixel_in(pixels, i, 0);
    return pixels[i][j];
}

// linear interpolation
function value_in(pixels, x, y) {
    var j = Math.floor(x - 0.5);
    var tj = x - 0.5 - j;
    var i = Math.floor(y - 0.5);
    var ti = y - 0.5 - i;
    return pixel_in(pixels, i, j) * (1 - ti) * (1 - tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i, j+1) * (1 - ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j+1) * (ti) * (tj)
         + pixel_in(pixels, i+1, j) * (ti) * (1 - tj);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
If we darken the pixels where the interpolated value meets the threshold, we'll get some kind of a contour.
    </p>
    <canvas id="interpolation_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    
    <p>
There are other methods. Plenty of them. But linear interpolation solves the cornery border problem just fine. Although, the border we see is just the borderline of some threshold. It's not a vector representation yet.
    </p>

    <h2>
Turning an interpolated image into a contour
    </h2>
    <p>
We can borrow an idea from the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_simplest_possible_smooth_contouring_algorithm.html">simplest possible smooth contouring</a> algorithm. We'll build an initial border from the source pixels, and then we'll use our linearly interpolated image to find the best place to put each contour point so the image value will meet the threshold value.
    </p>
    <p>
When you have a <span id="index_distance_field">distance field</span>, it's easy. A distance field is when for any point in space you can tell how far it lies from the surface you want. It's basically a function from point in space to distance.
    </p>
    <p>
You take its gradient, take the difference between the value you have and the threshold value. Since it's the distance field, the value difference is exactly the distance you should move your point for. And the gradient is the exact opposite direction. You just inverse, multiply, add — and you're there.
    </p>
    <p>
Unfortunately, we don't have a distance field. We have a continuous image which only resembles one.
    </p>
    <p>
But the principle still works. If you traverse against the gradient, you will get closer to the threshold value. And the more the difference, the further you have to go. It's just you wouldn't always get there in one try.
    </p>
    <p>
So let's try several times then. Let's make an <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/interactive_introduction_to_iterative_algorithms.html">iterative algorithm</a> out of it.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_2">// gradient
function gradient(pixels, x, y) {
    const eps = 1e-5;
    return [(value_in(pixels, x + eps, y) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps,
            (value_in(pixels, x, y + eps) - value_in(pixels, x, y)) / eps];
}

// how far should you shift the point to meet the isoline
// if value_in were a distance function
function gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, x, y) {
    var g = gradient(pixels, x, y);
    var g_norm = Math.sqrt(g[0]*g[0] + g[1]*g[1]);
    var d = threshold - value_in(pixels, x, y);
    return [g[0] * d / g_norm / g_norm, g[1] * d / g_norm / g_norm];
}

// brings a point closer to the threshold isoline
function fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, point) {
    const ok_error = 1/255;
    if(Math.abs(value_in(pixels, point[0], point[1]) - threshold) &lt; ok_error)
        return point;
    gs = gradient_shift(pixels, threshold, point[0], point[1])
    var new_point = [point[0] + gs[0], point[1] + gs[1]];
    return fit_point_better(pixels, threshold, new_point);
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
We'll move our contour points against the gradient until we're close enough to the threshold
    </p>
    <canvas id="fitting_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
        
    <p>
That's good but we can do better. Let's make the contour smooth.
    </p>

    <h2>
Cubic splines
    </h2>
    <p>
All we have to do to make the contour smooth is to turn each line segment into a parametric cubic curve.
    </p>
    <p>
It's probably sounds more complicated than it is. A parametric cubic curve is just a pair of polynomials. If you have the points and partial derivatives in this points, you can get the coefficients for them from this pair of <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/programmers_introduction_to_linear_equations.html">linear systems</a>:
    </p>
    <div><p>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dx<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Px(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = x<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = x<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Px(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>x</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dx<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p><p>
    
Py(t<sub>1</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + c = dy<sub>1</sub>/dt
<br>
Py(t<sub>1</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>1</sub> + d = y<sub>1</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>) = a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + d = y<sub>2</sub>
<br>
Py(t<sub>2</sub>)' = 3a<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2b<sub>y</sub>t<sub>2</sub> + c = dy<sub>2</sub>/dt
    </p></div>
    <p>
The curve itself will then look like this.
    </p>
    <canvas id="cubic_canvas" width="640" height="640"></canvas>
    <p>
Even more, since we get to choose the parameter range, we can make it [0..1]. This greatly simplifies our system and makes it really easy to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
Here is the function that makes one array of polynomial coefficients from two pairs of point and tangent values.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_3">// solver specific to [0..1] parametrized splines
function spline_for(p1, p1d, p2, p2d) {
//     A = [
//         [1, 0, 0, 0],
//         [0, 1, 0, 0],
//         [1, 1, 1, 1],
//         [0, 1, 2, 3]];
//     B = [p1, p1d, p2, p2d]
    return [
        p1,
        p1d,
        3*p2 - p2d - 3*p1 - 2*p1d,
        p2d + p1d - 2*p2 + 2*p1
    ];
}
    </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
The polynomial is then computed in every <i>t</i> with this function.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_4">// polynomial
function polynomial_in_t(A, t){
    var pt = 0.0;
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; A.length; ++i){

So for every line segment with tangents, we can make a parametric polynomial. There is one problem though. We don't have tangents.
    </p>
    <p>
We have the gradient, which is orthogonal to the tangent, but there are two possible tangents in every point. The tangent can be oriented left or right from the gradient.
    </p>
    <p>
But this is solvable. Let's just pick the direction we like and keep it consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
Let the curves that originally come from horizontally oriented segments always have both tangents that way that <i>dx &gt; 0</i>. And the ones that come from vertically oriented segments, will have <i>dy &gt; 0</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
It looks like we have enough parts to assemble an algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>
Creating splines from the pixels
    </h2>
    <p>
Let's split our vectorization into two parts. First, we'll get points and tangents for every line segment from the pixels. Then we'll turn it all into polynomial splines.
    </p>
    <p>
The function that does the first part looks like this.
    </p>
    <div>
    <pre id="code_5">function turn_pixels_into_points_and_tangents(pixels, threshold) {
    var points = [];
    var tangents = [];

    // "horizontal" pieces
    for(var i = 0; i &lt;= pixels.length; i += 1) {
        var old_point = [];
        var old_tangent = [];
        for(var j = 0; j &lt;= pixels[0].length; j += 1) {
            // if right, left, top, and bottom pixels have a sign change,
            // there should be a spline there
            var sign_change_on_the_right  =
                (pixel_in(pixels, i-1, j+0) - threshold) *
                (pixel_in(pixels, i+0, j+0) - threshold) &lt; 0;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3377">

<div>
<p>If you were born mid-90’s or earlier, you probably remember being bored. We used to talk to ourselves, play “make believe”, taking walks, listening to records, etc. We learned to entertain ourselves, imagine, and create.</p>
<p>Today, my children and children born into the age of the virtual world have not experienced boredom, at least not in the same way. In a sense, those who grew up in the 24-hour news cycle, with social media have never and will never experience being alone. They’ve rarely experience the <a href="https://austingwalters.com/the-last-free-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sense of freedom</a> that comes from thinking to oneself.</p>
<p>A personal concern, is that children’s personalities appear to develop in the absence of technology. They play with toys and make their world come to life. My two year old believes, with all his heart, that his toys are sentient. That our Roomba has feelings and needs to be “fed”. He’s learning reason, learning to manipulate the world, talking to us, and so much more.</p>
<h2>Tools of Gods</h2>
<p>Throughout all human history technology has been an extension of ourselves. Part of childhood is learning to use and create tools. However, today we don’t need to build tools. With phones, we have near infinite information, entertainment, and communication at our finger tips, we can connect to anyone or anything – instantly. Capture audio, video and picture with a tap. Search our memories with a voice command. Calculate any/all the math equations we can think of, etc. Our technology makes us ever more godlike.</p>
<p>To provide this godlike device to a child is irresponsible. Arguably, even in hands of adults, our devices do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The difference between adults and children, is that children need to <em>learn-to-learn</em>. It’s the most important thing a child can learn. How well a child <em>learns-to-learn </em>will shape their entire life, their potential is defined by how well they can learn. There are several important lessons in learning how to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to self-reflect</li>
<li>Nurturing curiosity</li>
<li>Defining ones goals</li>
<li>Indexing knowledge</li>
<li>Finding motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>There is probably more than goes into learning-to-learn, but that’s a good list for now.</p>
<p>For me, a defining moment was learning to sculpt my character in an effort to find motivation. I spent quite a bit of time reflecting on who I was and who I wanted to be. I defined myself and found the motivation I needed, with constant self-reflection to change. Without my time riding bikes, running, playing in the woods, soccer, walking alone, I wouldn’t be who I am today.</p>
<h2>Empathy is Derived from Self</h2>
<p>Having a godlike tool able solve most problems is a double edge sward. A phone is addictive by design. Mobile phones track us and companies learn everything about us, with that information being weaponized against us to maximize “screen time”. Is social media useful? Quite frankly, I’d argue no, social media has a net negative effect. Importantly, social media and games on your mobile device keep you constantly stimulated and often push others agenda(s)[<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>I question if most of the newer generations, born into their environment, have really learned to live in the physical world. Has the newer generation(s) learned to live with and identify themselves? Is there self-reflection and growth? Without an internal dialog, a lot of things break down: personality, autonomy, comfort with being alone, understanding alternative viewpoints… empathy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, [even more concerning] without an internal identity / dialog one doesn’t develop a “classic” ego. If a self-image is typically defined by an internal image and that internal image doesn’t develop, what guides us? Likes? Karma?</p>
<p>This would explain the rise in more extreme moral stances. Such as building a hierarchy based on gender, race, etc. Lack of empathy for others, at the same time garnering more karma, for karma is the value system people can hold themselves to. We no longer need to contemplate who we want to be, because we can receive instant feedback on our actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I suspect this optimizes for short-term gain, but long-term loss to society.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the start of the incredibly destructive cycle, where contemplating or a nuanced opinion is simply not acceptable, because others can’t relate.</p>
<center><iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cMYfxOFBBM?start=314" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<blockquote><p>I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I do.</p>
<p>– Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a firm believer that life is and should be tough. Growth comes from adaptation, confidence is derived from overcoming challenges. When life is tough, you have to create goals and blaze a trail to somewhere better. This is what it means to be “free”, free to have self-determination, which few embrace.</p>
<p>I wasn’t born to my current “class”. I would say, I was born “big-mac” rich, where you could buy a “big-mac” once a month without worrying about budget. My parents provided shelter, food and clothes, but I started mowing lawns at 12 and working a job by 14 to buy anything I needed beyond food and shelter. Yet today, (14 years &amp; a couple kids later), I’d call myself “iPhone” rich, I can buy something of equivalent cost monthly without worrying about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen in a vacuum.</p>
<p>My wife and I regularly create two and five year plans. These goals provide motivation. We can ask ourselves,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does this activity help hit our five year objective?</p></blockquote>
<p>If the answer is no, then it’s probably not worth doing it. We work hard, we reflect regularly and we try to improve; always iterating towards something better.</p>
<p>To have self-determination, people need to think for themselves. They need to contemplate what they want from life. They need to talk to themselves. Self-determination requires goals, it also requires grappling (or ignoring) others and importantly saying “no” and “yes” based on <em>objectives</em> not <em>desires</em>. In the end, this will make people happier.</p>
<p>It all starts with talking to ones-self, spending time alone and deciding what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<h2>A Bleak Outlook</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the god-like tools we’ve all grown accustom to (especially, when given to kids), seem to disrupt the ability to talk to one-self. In a sense, our phones, media, and general virtual world has taken all our time; this leaves us without time for self-reflection, self-thought, self-actualization. In this stunted world, the AI which manipulates our news replaces the ego we once had.</p>
<p>Complex discussions, real empathy, motivation — are going to be something most of us lose. I’m not sure if society is ready for what we created. It’s a mob of people who’ve never experienced real hardship, who’ve learned a social system designed by virtue signaling (aka trying to game the “karma” systems) and not really learning to live in the real world. Then again, these people will be shaping the real world, for better or worse.</p>

, I structured my lessons around primary sources such as the Bitcoin white paper and the Ethereum yellow paper.</p><p>This way, my students learned not only what I know, but also what’s the source of the knowledge. Now that they’re graduated, they know where to look for when they have questions.</p><p>Even though the course was four weeks long for each batch I could not answer some excellent questions in detail. Instead, I had to resort to black boxes.</p><p>How do digital signatures work? A black box.</p><p>What about ZK-STARKs? Another black box.</p><p>Black boxes help to teach a subject. Not so much for understanding in detail.</p><p>To understand Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more on a deeper level, one should know the pillars they are built on.</p><p>You understand the strength of the Bitcoin network when you know how does SHA-256 work.</p><p>You understand how your contracts run once you know the inner-working of the EVM.</p><p>You understand the security of the protocols you invest in when you, well, know a lot.</p><p>Thus, as you understand these subjects, you will realize how important blockchain really is. You will probably want to contribute to these exciting projects.</p><p>The more you will know, the more you will be able to participate in the governance of blockchains.</p><p>What should be the block size?</p><p>What’re your opinions on various layer 2 protocols?</p><p>How can you help us approaching the open questions on scalability?</p><p>All you need to do is to join the conversations, as long as you know about the subject in depth.</p><p>I recently realized that the most technical issues are getting the least participation.</p><p>Then, I decided to create this blog series with the goal of having new voices on the future of blockchain governances.</p><p>New voices that understand the contemporary issues very well.</p><p>This is one of the best things I can do for crypto.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One bull market to learn the lesson. Second bull market to make retirement money. Third bull market to ask not what crypto can do for you but what you can do for crypto.</p>— Qiao Wang (@QwQiao) <a href="https://twitter.com/QwQiao/status/1299500501604667396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2020</a></blockquote><h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2><p>The series will demand the reader to be comfortable with computer science papers. In fact, the content will be the papers.</p><p>My job is to curate the papers, explain their contexts in the blockchain space, and clarify them with my reading notes.</p><p>Ultimately, the series will offer a fundamental understanding of blockchain technologies to eager readers, be it economics students or CS professors.</p><h2 id="the-papers">The Papers</h2><p>I’m proud to present you 67 primary sources on the science of blockchains.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="str-vOKpYe5nW" data-connect-field="content"><p>Spreadsheet services like Google Sheets or Airtable have already used by many people, teams, and companies. What makes them more interesting is, they introduce non-tech users to the no-code movement, open doors for interesting possibilities.</p><p>No-code is like Starbuck, a kind of coffee also for people who don’t drink coffee. What great about Starbuck isn’t the taste, but it allows more people to enjoy coffee. In other words, <strong>no-code is a programming language for non-programmers</strong>.</p><p>Recently, I’ve examined using Google Sheet as a database service when integrating to <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Inverr</a> — a no-code builder. It can possibly operate for sites or apps with less than 5M visits/month, with big enough data storage for small apps. Though, it comes with some limitations.</p><p>In this post, I’ll address a few technical issues when using Google Sheets as a database service, its effects, and how to overcome it.</p><h3 id="1-search-is-inconvenient">1. Search is Inconvenient</h3><p>The main functions of the database are store, retrieve, and search for data. While Google Sheets is doing excellent at storing and retrieving data, the searching part in Google Sheets is a bit tricky.</p><p>On many apps, search provides discoverability. For example, when you’re building a movie discovery app, users search a movie by name, filter by a category, or popularity. Without search, the movie app is no different than a movie list.</p><p>To use the searching feature, Google Sheets APIs provide a property called “developerMetadata”. It’s an additional data on each cell, and invisible to Google Sheets users. When searching, it will use these additional data.</p><p>“developerMetadata” has a <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fsheets%2Fapi%2Fguides%2Fmetadata%23metadata_storage_limits">limit</a> of 30,000 characters for each spreadsheet. It’s too small to do anything great. Though, you can optimize for sentence, paragraph by only store important terms.</p><h3 id="2-quota-and-storagenbsplimits">2. Quota and Storage&nbsp;Limits</h3><p>Google Sheets has a storage limit at 5,000,000 cells (including blank ones), and up to 256 columns per sheet.</p><p>Let’s take an example as a movie discovery app, it needs at least 6 properties (id, title, description, release date, rating, category). As a rough estimation, you can only store up to 5,000,000 / 6 = <strong>~833k movies</strong>. Since there are currently <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fpressroom%2Fstats%2F">555,913 movies</a> released, in theory, it’s still acceptable.</p><p>Another limitation when using Google Sheet APIs is its request quota. Starting at 500 requests per 100 seconds (or 5 requests per second), and start charging when excessed. In many cases, using proper caching techniques will reduce the number of requests to Google Cloud APIs services.</p><h3 id="3-acceptable-performance-on-a-largenbspdataset">3.

It took around 2 seconds when getting 100k cells all at once, which 100k / 6 = ~16k movies. This is acceptable performance, and grows as the number of cells grows.</p><h3 id="4-no-schema-and-proper-restriction">4. No Schema and Proper Restriction</h3><p>Google Sheets is like a database with its own presentation. For example, you have a spreadsheet for monthly expenses. It contains a list of expenses, their category. And in the end, it can have a <strong>total expense value</strong> by the sum of all expenses in the month.</p><p>The layout freedom is convenient when using it as a spreadsheet, but a nightmare for a database. Because there is always some kind of fixed layout that the database follows. It allows the database engine to calculate the distance and navigate between rows of data. And no database designed without a layout.</p><p>Besides, unless you decided that no-one will ever touch the spreadsheet, someone might accidentally screw it up by renaming the tab or remove it.</p><hr><p>To conclude, Google Sheets is widely used as a tool. But as a database, it comes with some limitations. With proper caching and optimization, it is safe to use it as a database for webs/apps with &lt; 5.000.000 visits monthly.</p><p>Besides, its search limitation can be a huge bottleneck in many scenarios. You can use “developerMetadata” to enable data lookup. With 30k characters limits, it’s a good practice to store only “meta” data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finverr.com">Try to build a website with Google Sheet, or your own database →</a></p></div></div>]]>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes I would get some interesting questions from my friends about internet security, such as whether it is possible to leak the bank account password when logging to the online bank via an untrusted network, whether it is possible that the message you received from someone via an untrusted network got modified maliciously, and whether it is possible that someone pretends to be you and send messages in your name. My answers to those questions are as long as your computer and cell phone are uncontaminated they are almost impossible thanks to our modern public-key crytosystems and digital signatures.</p>



<p>There are a couple of introductions to the public-key crystosystems and digital signature available online. However, I think most of them are incomplete or hard to understand. In this blog post, I am going to describe the public-key crystosystems and digital signatures using extremely simple math, so that there would be no ambiguity at all.</p>

<h3 id="usages">Usages</h3>

<p>The modern cryptosystems are public-key encryption systems in which everyone has a public-key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public-key is seen by everyone, but the private is only accessible by the owner. The public-key encryption systems could also generate digital signatures which could be used to verify whether the message you received is unmodified and truly sent from the sender.</p>



<p>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a typical algorithm for the public-key cryptosystems used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. However, we are not going to introduce the RSA algorithm in this blog post. Instead, we would describe the public-key cryptosystems and digital signatures at a high level.</p>

<h3 id="essential-features">Essential Features</h3>

<p>Each user has their own encryption and decryption functions, $E$ and $D$, using public-key and private key respectively. We use $M$ to represent the message to be encrypted and sent. There are four features that are essential to a public-key cryptosystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decrypting an encrypted message gives you the original message (Of course!). Specifically,</li>
</ul><p>

\[D(E(M)) = M\]

</p><ul>
  <li>Encrypting a decrypted message gives you the original message (Hmm…). Specifically,</li>
</ul><p>

\[E(D(M)) = M\]

</p><ul>
  <li>
    <p>$E$ and $D$ are easy to compute. This means the encryption and decryption process should be fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$. This means you could hardly find a way to decrypt the encrypted message, even if you know how to encrypt the message.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We would ignore how to satisfy the four features in this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="message-encryption-and-decryption">Message Encryption and Decryption</h3>

<p>Suppose we have two people, Alice and Bob. Both of them are using the same public-key cryptosystems. This means Alice and Bob both have their private keys stored secretly and have their public key published to some authorities. From the authorities, we could find the public keys of Alice and Bob unambiguously. We denote encrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s public keys to be $E_A$ and $E_B$ respectively, and decrypting the message using Alice and Bob’s private keys to be $D_A$ and $D_B$ respectively.</p>



<p>One day, Alice wanted to send a private message $M$ to Bob. Alice found the public key of Bob, encrypted the message $M$ using Bob’s public key. The encrypted message for Bob is denoted as $C$.</p><p>

\[E_B(M) = C\]

</p><p>Once Bob received the encrypted message $C$, he could decrypt $C$ using his private key.</p><p>

\[D_B(C) = D_B(E_B(M)) = M\]

</p><p>Even if the network was compromised and someone intercepted $C$, it is still almost impossible to decrypt $C$ because of that $D_B$ is unknown and the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” for public-key cryptosystems.</p>



<p>The message content is safe because of the public-key encryption systems. However, it does not provide any assurance about the sender. For example, James could send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. If there is no author verification procedure and Bob is not careful enough, Bob might actually think the message is sent from Alice. In some other scenarios, James might have intercepted the encrypted message $C$ sent out from Alice to Bob, prevented the message transmission to Bob, replaced the original message to $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, encrypt it using $E_B$, and send it to Bob. Bob might also be convinced that the message content $M^\prime$ was actually the original message Alice has sent. Specifically,</p><p>

\[E_B(M^\prime) = C^\prime \\
D_B(C^\prime) = D_B(E_B(M^\prime)) = M^\prime\]

</p><p>Digital signatures, derived from the public-key cryptosystems, are designed to solve these authentication problems.</p>

<h3 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>In addition to the encrypted message $C$ that Alice sent to Bob, Alice would also have to send her digital signature $S$ to Bob. Namely,</p><p>

\[E_B(D_A(M)) = S\]

</p><p>Alice could find $E_B$ using Bob’s public key and $D_A$ using her private key.</p>



<p>Once Bob received both $S$ and $C$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key. Specially,</p><p>

\[D_B(C) = D_B(E_B(M)) = M \\
E_A(D_B(S)) = E_A(D_B(E_B(D_A(M)))) = E_A((D_A(M))) = M\]

</p><p>We found actually the two decrypted messages from $S$ and $C$ are exactly the same. This is expected if the message was sent from Alice and the content of the message was not modified. Let’s further see what will happen if someone pretends to be Alice to send a message to Bob, or the content of the message has been modified.</p>



<p>James, again, wanted to send Bob a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice, or had intercepted an encrypted message $C$ from Alice, blocked it and created a message $M^\prime$ which specifically says the message is from Alice. To make the message readable by Bob, James encrypted $M^\prime$ using $E_B$, send the encrypted message $C^\prime$ to Bob.</p><p>

\[E_B(M^\prime) = C^\prime\]

</p><p>Because Bob does not accept any message without a signature, James had to make up a signature. However, because James knew nothing about Alice’s private key, he used a decryption function $D_J$ which is different from Alice’s secrete $D_A$. The signature James generated would be</p><p>

\[E_B(D_J(M^\prime)) = S^\prime\]

</p><p>Once Bob received both $S^\prime$ and $C^\prime$, he could decrypt both $S$ and $C$ using his private key and Alice’s public key as usual. Specially,</p><p>

\[D_B(C^\prime) = D_B(E_B(M^\prime)) = M^\prime \\
E_A(D_B(S^\prime)) = E_A(D_B(E_B(D_J(M^\prime)))) = E_A((D_J(M^\prime))) = M^{\prime\prime}\]

</p><p>In this case, Bob would see the two decrypted messages are not the same. Bob would then realize that there is something unusual happened and he should not trust anything about the message.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-the-public-key-cryptosystems">Hacking the Public-Key Cryptosystems</h3>

<p>As long as the four features of the public-key cryptosystems hold, cracking it is almost impossible. If somedayy, when the almighty quantum computer is available, the feature “the publicity of $E$ does not compromise the secrecy of $D$” would be compromised, therefore the modern public-key cryptosystems would no longer be reliable. I may talk about this topic in the future.</p>



<p>There is another way to send fake messages to Bob in name of Alice, without using a quantum computer. If James could somehow crack the account name and password of Alice on the web application, replace the Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, when Bob tried to retrieve Alice’s encryption function, he would get $E_J$ instead of $E_A$. The decryption of signature $S^\prime$ would become $M^\prime$ instead of $M^{\prime\prime}$ then. Concretely,</p><p>

\[E_J(D_B(S^\prime)) = E_J(D_B(E_B(D_J(M^\prime)))) = E_J((D_J(M^\prime))) = M^{\prime}\]

</p><p>In this case the two decrypted messages match. Bob would be convinced that the message is from Alice and it has not been modified.</p>



<p>It should be noted that James was replacing Alice’s public encryption function from $E_A$ to $E_J$, instead of replacing his private decryption function from $D_J$ to $D_A$. In principle, $D_A$ would only be kept on Alice local computer and not anywhere else. Even if James has Alice’s account name and password on the web application, he would not get a copy of $D_A$ unless he specifically hacked Alice’s physical computer.</p>



<p>This reminds us that actually keeping our password safe is the most important.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<p>
Floating-point numbers are fine. They are decently designed and well standardized, they provide a good compromise between performance and precision. They work great most of the time. Until the day when they suddenly don't and nobody knows why.
	</p>
	<p>
For me, that day came when I encountered a bug in the Taubin estimator. <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-01-fall/Papers/taubin-smoothing.pdf">Taubin smoothing</a> takes a triangle mesh, a pair of magic numbers called λ and μ, a little time to think, and it makes the input mesh smooth. It also makes sure that the mesh isn't reduced to a perfectly smooth but rather uninteresting sphere or a point.
	</p>
	<p>
The first magic number λ is something between 0 and 1. When it's 0 — nothing happens at all, and when it's 1 — nothing good happens either. It should be somewhere in between. Nobody really knows how to pick this number but an experienced engineer can at least make an educated guess. 
	</p>
	<p>
The second magic number governs shrinkage compensation. It's a negative number slightly greater than λ in its absolute value. Nobody knows how to pick it either but this time even an educated guess is a challenge.
	</p>
	<p>
That's why you need an estimator. Something that picks the μ for you. And we have one. And it was bugged. And I was the one to fix it.
	</p>
	<p>
The first day of the investigation showed that the estimator is in fact entirely correct. The second day of the investigation  showed that the tests covering the bug are correct just as well. The third day of the investigation brought a promising hypothesis that the whole story is just a bad dream and all it takes to solve the mystery is to wake up. The fourth morning killed that hypothesis and left me completely clueless.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily I have a friend who is smarter than me and he advised to fuzz the input a little and see what happens then. I did. And something happened. The bug didn't go away but the μ changed a lot. Way unproportionally to the small changes in the input. Fascinating!
	</p>
	<p>
We can expect a computation to work with some error. It's fine, we get input data from sensors and they embed some error, to begin with. We print out our finished models, and the printers have some limited precision as well so a small error doesn't upset anyone. It's all good while the error is small. But what if it isn't?
	</p>
	<p>
As it turns out, in my case, a completely correct algorithm had a computational error of about 1. Not 1e-16 or 1e-5 but 1. Just 1. So if you expect your μ to be somewhat close to -0.7, and the estimator says it's 0.3, it is in fact correct. It is still a correct estimation within its error range.
	</p>
	<p>
Correct but entirely useless.
	</p>
	<h2>
Challenge your intuition with a “Guess the Error” game
	</h2>
	<p>
Ok, so it's not the computational error per se that causes trouble but only the unexpected and unpredictable error. Can we predict it though?
	</p>
	<p>
Well, of course, we can. There is a whole field of numerical error analysis for that but let's be honest, most of the time we use our intuition instead. So how good is our intuition exactly?
	</p>
	<p>
I propose a game to find out. Let's take a cubic equation solver. It's a relatively complex computation with a very simple way to validate its precision. We will pick some roots first and then we will generate the cubic equation for these roots. Then we'll make the cubic solver find our roots back through the computation. The difference between the original and the computed value for each root will be our measurable error. This error divided by the original value will be our relative error.
	</p>
	<p>
Here is the exact code for the experiment. It's also <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/blob/master/exp/rational_bounds/rationale/cubic_solver_example.cpp">available on GitHub</a>.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
Now if we pick our roots as 1, 2, and 3, the equation produced will be:
	</p>
	<p>
(x - 1) (x - 2) (x - 3) = 0
	</p>
	<p>
Expanding the brackets we get this:
	</p>
	<p>
x<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 11x - 6 = 0
	</p>
	<p>
And when we run our solver we get:
	</p>
	<p>
x = 1, x = 2, x = 3
	</p>
	<p>
Well, yes. On the equation this simple there is no error whatsoever. The computation works flawlessly. So let's start making it worse.
	</p>
	<h2>Round 1</h2>
	<p>
The slider below lets you pick an interval in the logarithmic scale. The interval may start at 10<sup>-12</sup> and end at 10<sup>12</sup>. It's impossible to predict the exact error up to a single number so you should just pick an appropriate interval that covers the error<span id="shown_note_1"><u onclick="show('note_1')">*</u>.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say we have the roots of 0.001, 2, 3 000. So to which interval, in your opinion, the maximum relative error for a cubic solver belongs?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_1" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 2</h2>
	<p>
Now let's make our roots even more diverse in magnitude. How about 1e-6, 2, and 3e6?
	</p>
	<p>
Where do you think the error might be?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_2" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	

	<h2>Round 3</h2>
	<p>
And what about 1e-9, 2, and 3e9?
	</p>
	<canvas id="interval_3" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	
	
	<h2>Meet the <span id="index_rational_bounds">rational bounds</span></h2>
	<p>
It's not the error per se that is bad. Error is omnipresent. Every measuring device has its error, every 3D printer and every milling machine has its maximal precision. The error is fine.
	</p>
	<p>
It's only the unpredictability that makes it unpleasant.
	</p>
	<p>
People address errors in multiple ways. In metrology, a measured value is supplemented with its absolute error. You don't say that the temperature outside is 10°, you say it's 10° ± 0.5°. This might seem redundant since this is a small error for the weather outside, but in some other context, this very error might become significant. If you're measuring body temperature, a 1-degree difference is enough to tell a sick person from a perfectly healthy one. You can not afford a whole 1-degree error in this scenario.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have this input error written down, you can pull it through your computation to see if the resulting error is still tolerable. To do that, you need to exchange your measured numbers for intervals. A number with error becomes an interval: 10° ± 0.5° becomes [9.5, 10.5]°.
	</p>
	<p>
You can sum these intervals just as you add numbers:
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_4" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
+
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_5" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_6" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
You can multiply them as well.
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_7" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
×
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_8" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
=
	</p>
<canvas id="interval_9" width="608" height="84"></canvas>
	<p>
So with intervals, you can accommodate the input error. You can drag it through the computation and see how it plays with other values with their own error. In the end, you will have your computed value within some interval and the size of this interval will indicate the output error. But what about the error of the computation itself?
	</p>
	<p>
A computational error occurs when we can't store the operation result in the same types we keep our operands in and we're forced to throw some data away. Let's say we have Python-style “unlimited” length integers. This means that if our computation only consists of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, we would never face any computational error.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, with division, things get a little bit different. E. g. we can't store <nobr>16 ¾</nobr> in integers so we have to truncate it into 16. In this case, the whole fractional part becomes our error.
	</p>
	<p>
We can use pairs of integers to represent rational numbers. This will solve the division issue. However, this type of rational number, while does not accumulate errors, accumulates digits. The more digits it has, the slower the computation goes. At some point, it may simply become impractically slow. Just like with the uncontrollable error, uncontrollable size becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
We want a compromise. Some entity that grows error controllably yet still operates in constant speed. And we can get it, for example, by merging two ideas: intervals and rational numbers together.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's say, we want to write a number as an interval of its tenths. We can do that most intuitively by throwing away all the digits after the first one.
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td>≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Just like we can do this with decimal fraction, we can do this with any rational number. We can put it between a pair of rational numbers made by finite integers. In this case, every integer is in the range [0, 1, ..., 99].
	</p>
	<table><tbody><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	<td rowspan="2">≤</td>
	<td></td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	</tr></tbody></table>
	<p>
Ok, this is not entirely true. If the number is greater than 99, then we can't really store it in our tiny rationals but we can say that it's larger than 99 by assigning the 0 divisor to its upper bound. Of course, it's just a dirty hack but let's leave it like that.
	</p>
	<p>
Now if we want to accommodate both input error and computational error, all we have to do is to represent an input interval in its finite rational numbers. A finite rational lower bound of this interval and a finite rational upper bound of the same interval.

	<p>
This entity — a pair of finite rational bounds, represents a real number along with both its input error and representational error. It also grows computational error explicitly while the size of the entity remains constant.
	</p>
	<p>
The implementation example is <a href="https://github.com/akalenuk/wordsandbuttons/tree/master/exp/rational_bounds/sketch_in_cpp">available on GitHub</a>. Please note that it's just a proof of concept and not the best possible solution in terms of neither error minimization nor speed.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
The computational error may become a problem at the least appropriate moment. Both rational numbers and intervals are well-known alternatives for floating-point numbers when the error becomes an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
Rational bounds, being a chimeric product of both ideas, let you manage both measurement error and computational error in a coherent way without compromising performance all that much.

As it's the NAT or firewall that opens the destination port, this bypasses any browser-based port restrictions.</p><p>This attack takes advantage of arbitrary control of the data portion of some TCP and UDP packets <i>without</i> including HTTP or other headers; the attack performs this new packet injection technique across all major modern (and older) browsers, and is a modernized version to my original <a target="_blank" href="https://samy.pl/natpin/">NAT Pinning technique from 2010</a> (presented at DEFCON 18 + Black Hat 2010). Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>

<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed

<li>POST data is "stuffed" to exact TCP segment size / packet boundary, then “SIP packet” appended and posted via web form</li>
<li><b>victim IP stack breaks the POST into multiple TCP packets, leaving the "SIP packet" (as part of POST data) in its own TCP packet without any accompanying HTTP headers</b></li>
<li>if browser alters size of multipart/form boundary (Firefox) or packet size changes for any other reason, size change is communicated back to client and client auto-resends with new size</li>
<li>when opening UDP port, SIP packet is sent over TURN protocol inside specially crafted <code>username</code> field forcing IP fragmentation and precise boundary control</li>
</ul></li>
<li>victim NAT sees proper SIP REGISTER packet on SIP port (with no HTTP data), triggering ALG to open any TCP/UDP port defined in packet back to victim
<ul>
<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP packet </li>

</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting desination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia ala Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application-level_gateway">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>In the context of computer networking, an application-level 
gateway consists of a security component that augments a 
firewall or NAT employed in a computer network. It allows 
customized NAT traversal filters to be plugged into the 
gateway to support address and port translation for certain 
application layer "control/data" protocols such as FTP, 
BitTorrent, SIP, RTSP, file transfer in IM applications, etc. 
In order for these protocols to work through NAT or a 
firewall, either the application has to know about an address/
port number combination that allows incoming packets, or the 
NAT has to monitor the control traffic and open up port 
mappings (firewall pinhole) dynamically as required. 
Legitimate application data can thus be passed through the 
security checks of the firewall or NAT that would have 
otherwise restricted the traffic for not meeting its limited 
filter criteria.</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="router-investigation--firmware-dumping">Router Investigation / Firmware Dumping</h2>

<p>I'd first like to see how common gateways actually treat packets and multi-port protocols like FTP, SIP, etc. To do this, we’ll want to reverse engineer the firmware from common routers. We could dump the flash from physical routers, however if we can get unencrypted firmware from the manufacturers, we’ll be able to investigate more router models and much faster.</p>

<p>We'll start with a common router, the Netgear Nighthawk R7000. A <a target="_blank" href="http://bfy.tw/NjZh">quick search</a> helps us …</p></div></div>

              <p>Whether you’re using logistic regression or a neural network, all models require data in order to be trained, tested, and deployed. Managing and creating the data sets used for these models requires lots of time and space, and can quickly become muddled due to multiple users altering and updating the data.</p><p>This can lead to unexpected outcomes as data scientists continue to release new versions of the models but test against different data sets. Many data scientists could be training and developing models on the same few sets of training data. This could lead to many subtle changes being made to the data set, which can lead to unexpected outcomes once the models are deployed.</p><p>This blog post discusses the many challenges that come with managing data, and provides an overview of the <strong>top tools for machine learning and data version control</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png" alt="Summary Comparison Table" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1000w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-01-at-20.03.51.png 1897w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Summary Table - read further for a more detailed comparison</figcaption></figure><p>Managing data sets and tables for data science and machine learning models requires a significant time investment from data scientists and engineers. Everything from managing storage, versions of data, and access require a lot of manual intervention.</p><h2 id="storage-space">Storage Space</h2><p>Training data can take up a significant amount of space on Git repositories. This is because Git was developed to track changes in text files, not large binary files. So if a team's training data sets involve large audio or video files, this can cause a lot of problems downstream. Each change to the training data set will often result in a duplicated data set in the repositories’ history. This not only creates a large repository but also makes cloning and rebasing very slow.</p><h2 id="data-versioning-management">Data Versioning Management</h2><p>When trying to manage versions, whether it be code or UIs, there is a widespread tendency— even among techies—to “manage versions,” by adding a version number or word to the end of a file name. In the context of data, this means a project might include data.csv, data_v1.csv, data_v2.csv, data_v3_finalversion.csv, etc. This bad habit is beyond cliché, with most developers, data scientists, and UI experts in fact starting out<em> </em>with bad versioning habits.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Nine Eight Seven" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1600&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517490232338-06b912a786b5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@steve_j?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Steve Johnson</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h2><p>When working in a production environment, one of the greatest challenges is dealing with other data scientists. If you’re not using some form of version control in a collaborative environment, files will get deleted, altered, and moved; and you will never know who did what. In addition, it will be difficult to revert your data to its original state. This is one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to managing models and datasets.</p><p>Data versioning is one of the keys to automating a team's machine learning model development. While it can be very complicated if your team attempts to develop its own system to manage the process, this doesn’t need to be the case.</p><p>Let’s explore six great, open source tools your team can use to simplify data management and versioning.</p><h2 id="dvc">DVC</h2><p><a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a>, or Data Version Control, is one of many available open-source tools to help simplify your data science and machine learning projects. The tool takes a Git approach in that it provides a simple command line that can be set up with a few simple steps. DVC doesn’t just focus on data versioning, as its name suggests. It also helps teams manage their pipelines and machine learning models. In the end, DVC will help improve your team's consistency and the <a href="https://thegradient.pub/independently-reproducible-machine-learning/">reproducibility of your models</a>.</p><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight, open-source, and usable across all major cloud platforms and storage types.</li><li>Flexible, format and framework agnostic, and easy to implement.</li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li>DVC version control is tightly coupled with pipeline management. This means if your team is already using another data pipeline tool, there will be redundancy.</li><li>DVC is lightweight, which means your team might need to manually develop extra features to make it easy to use.</li></ul><h2 id="delta-lake">Delta Lake</h2><p><a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake</a> is an open-source storage layer to help improve data lakes. It does so by providing ACID transactions, data versioning, metadata management, and managing data versions.</p><p>The tool is closer to a data lake abstraction layer, filling in the gaps where most data lakes are limited.</p><h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3><ul><li>Offers many features that might not be included in your current data storage system, such as ACID transactions or effective metadata management.</li><li>Reduces the need for hands-on data version management and dealing with other data issues, allowing developers to focus on building products on top of their data lakes instead.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3><ul><li>Delta Lake is often overkill for most projects as it was developed to operate on Spark and on big data.</li><li>Requires using a dedicated data format which means it is less flexible and not agnostic to your current formats.</li><li>Tool’s primary purpose is to act more like a data abstraction layer, which might not be what your team needs and can detour developers in need of a lighter solution.</li></ul><h2 id="git-lfs">Git LFS</h2><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs">Git LFS</a> is an extension of Git developed by a number of open-source contributors. The software aims to eliminate large files that may be added into your repository (e.g., photos and data sets) by using pointers instead.</p><p>The pointers are lighter weight and point to the LFS store. Thus when you push your repo into the main repository, it doesn’t take long to update and doesn’t take up too much space.</p><p>This is a very lightweight option when it comes to managing data.</p><h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3><ul><li>Integrates easily into most companies' development workflows.</li><li>Utilizes the same permissions as the Git repository so there is no need for additional permission management.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3><ul><li>Git LFS requires dedicated servers for storing your data. This, in turn, eventually leads to your data science teams being locked in as well as increased engineering work.</li><li>Git LFS servers are not meant to scale, unlike DVC, which stores data into a more general easy-to-scale object storage like S3.</li><li>Very specific and may require using a number of other tools for other steps of the data science workflow.</li></ul><h2 id="pachyderm">Pachyderm</h2><p><a href="https://pachyderm.io/">Pachyderm </a>is one of the few data science platforms on this list. Pachyderm’s aim is to create a platform that makes it easy to reproduce the results of machine learning models by managing the entire data workflow. In this regard, Pachyderm is “the Docker of data.”</p><p>Pachyderm leverages Docker containers to package up your execution environment. This makes it easy to reproduce the same output. The combination of both versioned data and Docker makes it easy for data scientists and DevOps teams to deploy models and ensure their consistency.</p><p>Pachyderm has committed itself to its <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/dsbor/">Data Science Bill of Rights</a>, which outlines the product’s main goals: reproducibility, data provenance, collaboration, incrementality, and autonomy, and infrastructure abstraction.</p><p>These pillars drive many of its features and allow teams to take full advantage of the tool.</p><h3 id="pros-3">Pros</h3><ul><li>Based on containers, which makes your data environments portable and easy to migrate to different cloud providers.</li><li>Robust and can scale from relativity small to very large systems.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-3">Cons</h3><ul><li>More of a learning curve due to so many moving parts, such as the Kubernetes server required to manage Pachyderm’s free version.</li><li>With all the various technical components, it can be difficult to integrate Pachyderm into a company’s existing infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="dolt">Dolt</h2><p><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/">Dolt</a> is a unique solution as far as data versioning goes. Unlike some of the other options presented that simply version data, Dolt is a database.</p><p>Dolt is an SQL database with Git-style versioning. Unlike Git, where you version files, Dolt versions tables. This means you can update and change data without worrying about losing the changes.</p><p>While the app is still new, there are plans to make it 100% Git- and MySQL-compatible in the near future.</p><h3 id="pros-4">Pros</h3><ul><li>Lightweight and partially open source.</li><li>SQL interface, making it more accessible for data analysts compared to more obscure options.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-4">Cons</h3><ul><li>Dolt is still a maturing product in comparison to other database versioning options.</li><li>Dolt is a DB, which means you must migrate your data into Dolt in order to get the benefits.</li><li>Built for versioning tables. That means that it won’t cover other types of data (e.g images, freeform text).</li></ul><h2 id="lakefs">LakeFS</h2><p><a href="https://lakefs.io/">LakeFS</a> lets teams build repeatable, atomic, and versioned data lake operations. It's a newcomer on this scene, but it packs a punch. It provides a Git-like branching and version control model that is meant to work with your data lake, scaling to Petabytes of data.</p><p>Similar to Delta Lake, it provides ACID compliance to your data lake.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <article>
<p>It’s halloween and time for another Gleam release! This time it’s an extra
special release as it also includes the first version of <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp">Gleam’s type safe
actor system</a>, compatible with Erlang’s OTP.</p>

<h2 id="mutual-recursion">Mutual recursion</h2>

<p>Historically functions in Gleam had to be defined in a module prior to being used.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>helper</span><span>()</span> <span>// Compile error! Function `helper` not found</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>helper</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>0</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has proven to be an annoyance as even though our code <em>should</em> compile
(all the required functions have been defined in the module) the compiler
won’t succeed unless we carefully maintain a specific order of functions in
the module.</p>

<p>This limitation also forced the programmer to write any helper functions at
the top of the file, before the functions that make use of them. Many people
like to write their code in the opposite order with their entry-point at the
top (such as a <code>main</code> function), and then helper functions below. That way
the module reads top-to-bottom, introducing new functions in the order they
are used.</p>

<p>Lastly it also meant that two functions could not call each other, making
useful techniques such as mutual recursion impossible.</p>

<p>With this release statements in a module can be written in any order, and
they still don’t require any type annotations to be fully type checked.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>barry</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"To you!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>paul</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>paul</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"To me!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>barry</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s the only major change to the language this time. For a full list of
changes see the <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0120-rc4---2020-10-31.">compiler changelog</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, Gleam’s new type safe actor system!</p>

<h2 id="gleam-otp">Gleam OTP</h2>

<p>Gleam’s actor system is built with a few primary goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full type safety of actors and messages.</li>
  <li>Be compatible with Erlang’s OTP actor framework.</li>
  <li>Provide fault tolerance and self-healing through supervisors.</li>
  <li>Have equivalent performance to Erlang’s OTP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two notable non-goals are that we are not explicitly supporting the BEAM’s
hot code upgrades, and we do not provide type safety for distributed
computing where two BEAM nodes on different computers send messages to each
other.</p>

<p>The core concepts of Gleam OTP are processes, channels, actors, and
supervisors. Let’s take a look at each of them.</p>

<h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>

<p>The core concurrency primitive in Gleam OTP is the process, which is a
lightweight green thread implemented by the BEAM virtual machine. These
processes are extremely cheap to create and run, and a single BEAM instance
can happily run millions of processes at the same time. It’s highly
sophisticated preemptive scheduler will ensure they make full use of all the
cores of the CPU, and no malicious or buggy process can block others from
running.</p>

<p>There’s a wealth of information online about the BEAM’s processes so we won’t
cover it all here, but know that Gleam’s actor system performs well thanks to
decades of excellent work by the Erlang community.</p>

<p>Use processes in Gleam we import the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/"><code>gleam/otp/process</code></a> module which
provides functions for creating and working with them.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the new process!"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>

  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this code snippet we create a new process using the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#start"><code>process.start</code></a> function, before printing a message to
the console.</p>

<p>The newly created process also prints a message, but because the two
processes run asynchronously (and likely run on different CPU cores) we don’t
know which will be printed first. It could be the new one first, or it could
be the parent, and it could be different each time the program runs.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is that there’s no need for an <code>async/await</code>
syntax or callbacks. Asynchronous code in Gleam looks exactly the same to
regular synchronous code and doesn’t require any special types such as
futures or promises.</p>

<p>This should hopefully feel familiar to people familiar with concurrent
programming in languages such as Erlang, Elixir, and Go.</p>

<h3 id="channels">Channels</h3>

<p>It’s not good enough to merely be able to create processes, we need processes
to be able to communicate and cooperate. Erlang and Gleam don’t have mutable
state so locks and shared mutable state is not an option- instead Gleam uses
channels.</p>

<p>Channels allow one process to send a message to another in a type safe
fashion, and they may be familiar to Go and Rust programmers.</p>

<p>A channel is made of a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#Sender"><code>Sender</code></a>, which messages as sent into,
and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#Receiver"><code>Receiver</code></a>, which messages are pulled out of by the
channel owner process.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Create a new channel owned by the current process</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>tuple</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>receiver</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.new_channel</span><span>()</span>

  <span>process</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the new process!"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// Send a message to the parent process</span>
    <span>process</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>"Done"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>})</span>

  <span>// Receive a message from the child, waiting up to 100ms</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.receive</span><span>(</span><span>receiver</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>// This returns Ok("Done")</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the code has been updated to use a channel to coordinate the processes.
The parent process creates a channel and waits for the child to send a
message over the channel before printing. Because of this we know that the
child process will now always print to the console before the parent does.</p>

<p>Here we’re just using a simple string message to synchronize processes but
any type we want can be sent over channel, enabling sharing of data in
concurrent programs.</p>

<p>The Gleam compiler can full type check channels. Because the message sent
with the sender is a <code>String</code> the compiler knows messages pulled from the
receiver must also be strings and will print a helpful error with any program
that doesn’t use these messages correctly.</p>

<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>

<p>In programs written in Erlang using OTP we tend to not use raw processes
frequently, instead we use a higher level abstraction called <code>gen_server</code>
that builds upon a process to provide additional features making it more
suited to being used in a long-lived Erlang application. Gleam is similar,
though our higher level abstraction is called <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/actor/"><code>actor</code></a> and
differs in design to <code>gen_server</code> in order to provide type safety.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>io</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>actor</span>
<span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>Sender</span><span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Message</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Request</span><span>(</span><span>reply_channel</span><span>:</span> <span>Sender</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>actor</span> <span>=</span> <span>actor</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>handle_message</span><span>)</span>

  <span>// Send a message to the child and wait for a response</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.call</span><span>(</span><span>actor</span><span>,</span> <span>Request</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>// This returns Ok("Done")</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello from the parent process!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>handle_message</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>:</span> <span>Message</span><span>,</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>io</span><span>.println</span><span>(</span><span>"The actor got a message"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>process</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>.reply_channel</span><span>,</span> <span>"Done"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>actor</span><span>.Continue</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the code has been adapted to use an actor rather than a low-level
process, and instead of explicitly creating a new channel we use the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/0.1.1/gleam/otp/process/#call"><code>call</code></a> function. This function is similar to Erlang’s
<code>gen_server:call</code> in that it provides a way to send a message to a process
and then wait until a reply is received.</p>

<p>Since an actor is being used here rather than a raw process it doesn’t shut
down after running the function once, instead the handler function is called
once per message received and the actor continues to run until either it is
requested to shut down or it returns <code>actor.Stop</code> from its handler function.</p>

<p>Any of OTP’s debug or system messages sent to the actor are automatically
handled by the actor implementation, while they would need to be manually
handled when using a raw process.</p>

<h3 id="supervisors">Supervisors</h3>

<p>Supervisors are special actors that start other actors and then monitor them
to ensure they are healthy. If one of the children crashes the supervisor
restarts it along with any younger children, restoring the program to a
healthy state now that any transient problems have ended.</p>

<p>If the problem is not transient and the child continues to crash then the
supervisor will shut down and then the supervisor’s supervisor can attempt a
restart now that more possibly invalid or corrupt state has been reset.</p>

<p>By using this supervision functionality OTP applications can achieve high
reliability by shedding state in an incremental fashion until the program
self-heals. This is kind-of similar to how Kubernetes and other container
orchestrators handle failure in microservices, though faster and more precise
thanks to it being integrated at all levels of the program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>gleam</span><span>/</span><span>otp</span><span>/</span><span>supervisor</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>add</span><span>,</span> <span>returning</span><span>,</span> <span>worker</span><span>}</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span><span>/</span><span>monitoring</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span><span>/</span><span>database</span>
<span>import</span> <span>my_app</span><span>/</span><span>web</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>supervisor</span><span>.start</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>children</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>children</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>.start</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>monitoring</span><span>.start</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>worker</span><span>(</span><span>web</span><span>.start</span><span>))</span>
  <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we have a supervisor for a pretend Gleam web application. It has 3
children of the type <code>worker</code>, a database connection, an actor responsible
for monitoring, and a HTTP handling actor. If we were adding a supervisor
child we could use the <code>supervisor</code> function instead of <code>worker</code>.</p>

<h3 id="going-forward">Going forward</h3>

<p>Gleam OTP v0.1 is the result of approaching 2 years of research and
implementation, mostly focusing on how to strike a good balance between type
safety and compatibility with existing Erlang OTP patterns.</p>

<p>Rather than build on top of Erlang’s <code>supervisor</code> and <code>gen_server</code> Gleam OTP
has a small core written in Erlang which implements the <code>Receiver</code> half of
channels, and the rest is implemented in Gleam. Thanks to this we can have
greater confidence in the viability of the core abstractions as they have
been sufficient to implement the rest of Gleam OTP in a type safe fashion.</p>

<p>These APIs (particularly supervisor) are experimental and open to breaking
changes as we discover new ways to improve them, but we’ve reach a point
where we can start writing programs using it.</p>

<p>If you write something using Gleam OTP please do get in touch and let us know
how you find it!</p>

<h2 id="discord-chat">Discord chat</h2>

<p>Lastly, we’ve got a new home for the community! The Gleam IRC channel has
been replaced by the Gleam Discord chat server to great success. Since
opening we’ve seen a big increase in activity and lots of new exciting Gleam</p></article></article></div>

<section>
	<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The idea of hypertext preceded the World Wide Web by decades. But nearly all hypertext systems worked on local files. Tim Berners-Lee wanted to create a system that would work across networks so that people could link from a file on one machine to another file on another machine.</p>
		<p>WorldWideWeb wasn't just a programme for browsing files. It was a browser and editor. The introductory text reads:</p>
		<blockquote>HyperMedia Browser/Editor, An excercise in global information availability by Tim Berners-Lee</blockquote>
		<p>Today it's hard to imagine that web browsers might also be used to create web pages. It turned out that people were quite happy to write HTML by hand—something that Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues never expected. They thought that some kind of user interface would be needed for making web pages and links. That's what the WorldWideWeb browser provided. You could open a document in one window and "mark" it. Then, in a document in another window, you could create a link to the marked page.</p>
		<p>You'll notice as you use the WorldWideWeb browser that you need to double-click links to open them. That's because a single click was used for editing.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Browsing</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The user interface of the WorldWideWeb browser somewhat blurred the lines between documents on your own computer and documents out on the network. To "browse" directly to a document out on the network, you need to know its URL. But you can't simply type that URL into an address bar; there is no address bar. Instead you have to follow a sequence of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Document".</li>
			<li>Now from the newly-opened "Document" menu, select "Open from full document reference".</li>
			<li>Type the URL into the field marked "reference".</li>
			<li>Press the "Open" button</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a web-based document (or web page, as we would say today) open in WorldWideWeb, you can navigate by double-clicking on links. Every link you double-click will open in a new window.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Linking</h2>
	<div>
		<p>At its heart, WorldWideWeb is a word processor …but with links. And just as you <em>can</em> use a word processor purely for reading documents, the real fun comes when you write your own. Especially when you throw hyperlinks into the mix.</p>
		<p>To create a document:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "New File..."</li>
			<li>Type the name of the file you want to create e.g. example.html</li>
			<li>In the boilerplate document, click on the heading to edit. Same with the text.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Once you've got a document written, it's time to turn from regular text into <em>hyper</em>text:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the "WorldWideWeb" menu, select "Links"</li>
			<li>To link to another document, you need to have that other document open in another window. Click on its title bar to focus it.</li>
			<li>With that document in focus, select "Mark all" from the "Links" menu.</li>
			<li>Now switch back to your example.html document and highlight the text you want to be a link.</li>
			<li>From the "Links" menu, select "Link to marked".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You can even save your new document on to your hard drive. Click on "Save a copy offline" under the "Documents" menu.</p>
		<p>Once you've downloaded the file to your computer, you can open it up with a text editor to see what the HTML would have looked like.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<div>
	<p>To edit any document, whether it's one you created, or a page on the world wide web:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the text you want edit.</li>
		<li>Edit it.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>That's it.</p>
	<p>If you want to keep a copy of the edited document, choose "Save a copy offline" from the "Documents" menu.</p>
	</div>

<p>
Computers used to be fun. Programming felt magical – it gave you the
ability to create something out of nothing. Over the last few decades, personal
computers have become increasingly impersonal, and programming has lost much of
that magic.
</p>
<p>
But some still recognize that programming can be a creative endeavor, undertaken
for its own sake. In fact, there are thriving communities working to create
elegant, empowering tools for the next generation of tinkerers. In this article,
I want to highlight some of my favorite projects that are working to bring magic
back to programming.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" rel="nofollow">PICO-8</a>
is a <i>fantasy console</i> – an emulator for a Commodore 64-era computer
that never existed. You can just boot it up and start typing in commands from
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual" rel="nofollow">the manual</a>.
PICO-8 is perfect for people who are new to programming, and its constraints make
it a fun challenge even for experienced programmers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://pharo.org/" rel="nofollow">Pharo</a>
is a living descendant of the legendary Smalltalk-80 system. Describing it as a
programming language would be inadequate – it's like a world inside a
computer. Pharo is expansive, yet playing around in it feels cozy. Spending a
few weekends with this environment has enriched my appreciation for what
programming can be.
</p>
<p>
Few things are more satisfying than bootstrapping an entire programming language
from scratch.
<a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth" rel="nofollow">Jonesforth</a>
is a complete
implementation of the Forth programming language in
<a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S" rel="nofollow">a couple thousand lines of thoroughly commented assembly code</a>.
Forth sits somewhere in the space between genius and insanity. It's weird and
beautiful, and well worth tinkering with.
</p>
<p>
If you want to go a level deeper, Andreas Kling is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AndreasKling/videos" rel="nofollow">documenting the process of building an entire operating system in C++</a>.
His videos about
<a href="http://serenityos.org/" rel="nofollow">SerenityOS</a>
show just how much work goes into building an operating system – but also
demonstrate that such a feat is remarkably achievable.
</p>
<p>
Modern computers are complicated, but the principles behind them don't have to
be.
<a href="https://eater.net/" rel="nofollow">Ben Eater's</a>
video series in which he
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&amp;list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU" rel="nofollow">builds his own computer on a breadboard</a>
is a must watch, even if you're not planning to follow along yourself. He
explains the process so elegantly that it almost seems obvious.
</p>
<p>
But you don't need an interest in electronics or operating systems to enjoy
programming. Web development has a reputation for being needlessly obtuse, but
at its best, the Web is one of the most amazing technologies we have. It lets
you create something that anyone, anywhere can start using the moment you put it
out there just by clicking a link.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://glitch.com/" rel="nofollow">Glitch</a>
boils Web development down to its basics. With one button click, you get your own
little server on the web where you can build anything you want. There's no
deployment, source control or build pipelines – just code.
</p>
<p>
And the
<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/" rel="nofollow">Small Web</a>
is home to hundreds of little communities, existing outside the big bubble of
commercial social media. If you want your own space on the Web, there's
<a href="https://neocities.org/" rel="nofollow">Neocities</a>,
<a href="http://tilde.club/" rel="nofollow">tilde.club</a>
and
<a href="https://special.fish/" rel="nofollow">Special Fish</a>
to name a few. Why should you have to sell your data just because you want to
connect with people?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
If programming is getting stale, I encourage you to check out some of the
projects on this list. Try to create something unoriginal, useless and
unfinished – and have fun doing it. You don't need a reason to write a
program or build a website. It's okay to create something just because it's
fun to create.

Programming can still be magical.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Many applications are automatically tested on each commit inside a GitLab pipeline. If your application relies on a database such as PostgreSQL, it can be tempting to use an in-memory database such as H2 for tests because it is easier to set up and destroy for each execution of your test suite. While this works for simple applications, it is no longer possible once you rely on vendor-specific SQL features (e.g., usage of column types not available in H2).</strong></p><p><strong>In this article, I will demonstrate how you can easily set up PostgreSQL in your GitLab pipeline for Spring Boot applications and improve the quality of your unit and integration tests.</strong></p><h3>Setting Up PostgreSQL in your .gitlab-ci.yml</h3><p>Gitlab allows the definition of (network accessible) <em>services</em> that are linked to your application containers when the pipeline is executed. Databases are perfect examples of such services. They are defined in the <code>services:</code> section of your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">services:

The service can be accessed by its image name (where everything after the : is stripped): <code>postgres</code>.</p><p>The database credentials can be defined using the <code>variables:</code> section:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">variables:
  POSTGRES_DB: my_database
  POSTGRES_USER: bernhard
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "somepassword"
  POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust</pre><h3>Configure your application to use the database</h3><p>You can connect to the database the same way you would connect to any database on a network. In Spring Boot, it is best practice to define the database connection via your <code>application.properties</code> file or directly via environment variables.</p><p>For the above credentials, your configuration would look like this:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="generic">spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/my_database
spring.datasource.username=bernhard
spring.datasource.password=somepassword</pre><p>As stated above, the host name of your database service is <code>postgres</code>, which is why your jdbc connection string connects to <code>postgres:5432</code> (which is the default port of PostgreSQL).</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Yes, it is really that easy to use a real PostgreSQL database in your unit and integration test pipeline. By matching the exact database version that is also used in production, you can avoid many subtle errors that may not be apparent when relying on an in-memory database.</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions or whether you found this useful in the comments section.</p></div></div>]]>

  <time datetime="2020-10-30T00:00:00+00:00">30 Oct 2020</time>
  <p><em>Credits: The solution described in this post is based on <a href="https://github.com/alexeagle">Alex Eagle</a>’s suggestion in: <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/773">https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/issues/773</a></em></p>

<p>While migrating the Nexar backend mono-repo to use Bazel as our main build-system I encountered a particularly painful challenge of compiling Go packages with C dependencies, such as <a href="http://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go">confluent-go-kafka</a> or <a href="https://github.com/paulsmith/gogeos">libgeos</a>. For others who will hit this issue, this will be a short and practical post showing what I finally came up with.</p>

<h3 id="first-try-let-gazelle-figure-things-out">First try: let Gazelle figure things out</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle">Gazelle</a>  is a really great project from the Bazel community that helps us automatically generate BUILD files for our Golang Bazel projects. It can look at our <code>go.mod</code> files that describe our external dependencies and translate them for us into <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go">rules_go</a>’s <code>go_repository</code> invocations that will fetch external dependencies into our WORKSPACE and create a BUILD file for them. For 99% of our mono-repo’s dependencies this worked smoothly; all we had to do is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bazel run //:gazelle -- update-repos -from_file=go.mod -to_macro=deps.bzl%go_dependencies
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And Gazelle would generate a macro that contains invocations to <code>go_repository</code> for each of our module’s dependencies. In this post, I focus on the few dependencies that this did not work well with, and document my way around those edges.</p>

<p>Our <code>go.mod</code> file contains a dependency on:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>require (
	github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go v1.4.2
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gazelle analyzes our dependencies and emits this block in the <code>deps.bzl</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>go_repository(
    name = "com_github_confluentinc_confluent_kafka_go",
    importpath = "github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go",
    sum = "h1:13EK9RTujF7lVkvHQ5Hbu6bM+Yfrq8L0MkJNnjHSd4Q=",
    version = "v1.4.2",
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Trying to build we get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ bazel build @com_github_confluentinc_confluent_kafka_go//kafka:kafka

<h3 id="compiling-cmake-projects-from-within-a-bazel-workspace">Compiling CMake Projects From Within a Bazel Workspace</h3>

<p>We need to compile our C dependencies into a static library (.a file) in order to provide it to the go linker. We could try to create new Bazel BUILD files on top of that project, but that would require us to deep dive into that dependency and mimic anything it’s authors have done in the original build, wouldn’t it make sense to try and invoke the CMake build from within Bazel? A crude way to do this is using a <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/general.html#genrule">genrule</a>, which allows us to invoke any arbitrary command as part of our action graph, but it turns out there’s a great project called <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc">rules_foreign_cc</a> which are “<em>[Bazel] Rules for building C/C++ projects using foreign build systems inside Bazel projects.”</em></p>

<p>We add it to our WORKSPACE file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>strip_prefix</span> <span>=</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc-master"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/archive/master.zip"</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>load</span><span>(</span><span>"@rules_foreign_cc//:workspace_definitions.bzl"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rules_foreign_cc_dependencies"</span><span>)</span>

<span>rules_foreign_cc_dependencies</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So instead of figuring out an elaborate, specific  BUILD file for the C library we are using, we can simply use the foreign dependency rules to invoke the original CMake build and integrate it natively with our action graph.</p>

<p>We add this to our WORKSPACE:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"librdkafka"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>build_file_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""load("@rules_foreign_cc//tools/build_defs:cmake.bzl", "cmake_external")

filegroup(
    name = "sources",
    srcs = glob(["**"]),
)

cmake_external(
    name = "librdkafka",
    cache_entries = {
        "RDKAFKA_BUILD_STATIC": "ON",
        "WITH_ZSTD": "OFF",
        "WITH_SSL": "OFF",
        "WITH_SASL": "OFF",
        "ENABLE_LZ4_EXT": "OFF",
        "WITH_LIBDL": "OFF",
    },
    lib_source = ":sources",
    static_libraries = [
        "librdkafka++.a",
        "librdkafka.a",
    ],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
"""</span><span>,</span>
    <span>sha256</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ae27ea3f3d0d32d29004e7f709efbba2666c5383a107cc45b3a1949486b2eb84"</span><span>,</span>

    <span>urls</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/archive/v1.4.0.tar.gz"</span><span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s break it down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We use <code>http_archive</code> to pull in a resource from the internet into our Bazel project.</li>
  <li>We provide a custom BUILD file for Bazel to use to build this target.</li>
  <li>the invocation of <code>cmake_external</code> tells Bazel how to invoke CMake (<code>cache_entries</code> is the CMake input arguments), and what output files it provides (<code>static_libraries</code>) so this target can be depended on downstream in the Bazel action graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can now build our header files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ bazel build @librdkafka//:librdkafka

INFO: Analyzed target @librdkafka//:librdkafka (3 packages loaded, 530 targets configured).
INFO: Found 1 target...

INFO: Elapsed time: 3.959s, Critical Path: 0.13s
INFO: 0 processes.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 2 total actions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my specific use-case, I wanted to link the my build of the confluent-go-kafka library with zlib, so I could avoid getting this error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/external/librdkafka/librdkafka/lib/librdkafka.a(rdgz.c.o):rdgz.c:function rd_gz_decompress: error: undefined reference to 'inflateGetHeader'

....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To do that I did a very similar thing to what I’ve done with the <code>librdkafka</code> library, adding to the WORKSPACE:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>http_archive</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"zlib"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>build_file_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""load("@rules_foreign_cc//tools/build_defs:cmake.bzl", "cmake_external")

filegroup(
    name = "sources",
    srcs = glob(["**"]),
)

cmake_external(
    name = "zlib",
    cache_entries = {

    },
    lib_source = ":sources",
    static_libraries = ["libz.a"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
"""</span><span>,</span>

    <span>],</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I could now build it:</p>

For more information have a look at the <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Bitcoin energy consumption index</a>, as at October 2020 the energy consumption is <strong>22.6% of the UK power consumption.</strong> </p><figure><img src="https://blog.dovu.earth/content/images/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-23-at-15.47.51.png"><figcaption>Bitcoin’s energy consumption relative to countries <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">see reference link</a></figcaption></figure><p>Although this is a known problem and there is a range of solutions that solve the "energy" problem including using <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake">Proof of Stake</a> but there is an ICO issue.

October 31, 2020 | https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Why-Clojure/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One piece of unattributed wisdom that's stuck with me is "don't take more than one technology bet". At <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ladder</a>, our big bet is using <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder is hiring! If you're interested, please check out our job description <a href="https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2>Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2>Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2>Developer experience</h2>
<p>When I’ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>It’s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespace’s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2>Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Programming is a game of abstractions, and we programmers traffic in ideas.
When I find an idea that resonates with me, I turn into an evangelist for it to
everyone who works with me.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorites. There’s a recency bias; I can’t remember some of
the formative essays from my early years as a programmer. </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">Ben Kuhn</a> for this idea!</p>
<h3>Essays</h3>
<p>Jeff Atwood, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/">The First Rule of Programming: It’s Always Your Fault</a>. I
like to answer questions on Stack Overflow, and an amazing amount of questions
on that website have a title like “Found a bug in React?” paired with an
introductory sentence: “I’m brand new to React.” It’s human to assume there’s a
problem with your tools or materials. To me, this essay’s point is that it’s
more profitable to assume the opposite, because your code hasn’t stood up to
anything close to the scrutiny of the code from a popular software project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you truly aspire to being a humble programmer, you should have no qualms
about saying “hey, this is my fault— and I’ll get to the bottom of it.”
— Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Shawn Wang, <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>. Be public, leverage the encouragement and
criticism of others, and build a footprint for yourself on the internet. There
are a bunch of detours you can take as a junior developer that waste time and
potentially graduate you to <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">expert beginner</a> status; one of
them is hiding your work in an attempt to avoid criticism. I think one of the
smartest parts of argument this can be summed up in the adage: “The fastest way
to get the right answer to a question is to post the wrong answer on the
internet.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People think you suck? Good. You agree. Ask them to explain, in detail, why
you suck. You want to just feel good or you want to be good? No objections, no
hurt feelings. Then go away and prove them wrong.
— Shawn Wang</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Elisabeth Hendrickson, <a href="https://testobsessed.com/2020/02/momentum-urgency/">Momentum &gt;
Urgency</a>. I found this post
recently, and it describes the best teams I’ve worked with. Effective teams
focus on process, not outcome. Managers of such teams know that a team member
being blocked isn’t a frustrating detail that that team member will have to
remedy, but rather a process failure that was luckily exposed while many more
remain hidden. They’ll use their managerial clout to fight with you against
that obstacle, considering it a top priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’ve learned is that if we want things to go fast, a sense of momentum
is much more effective than a sense of urgency.
— Elisabeth Hendrickson</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Scott Hanselman, <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">Do they deserve the gift of your
keystrokes?</a>.
This post isn’t just for programmers, but the statistical nature of it
resonated with me. Since reading it, I often consider the reach of my chosen
communication method, and whether I’m making efficient use of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming you want your message to reach as many people as possible, blog it. You only have so many hours in the day.
— Scott Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Joel Spolsky, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/">The Iceberg Secret,
Revealed</a>.
Programmers know that what we can see on a web page can represent a small
fraction or none of the true functionality, completeness, and complexity of the
application. People who don’t write software don’t automatically know that.
Factor this into all communication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Customers Don’t Know What They Want. Stop Expecting Customers to Know What
They Want. It’s just never going to happen. Get over it.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand that any demos you do in a darkened room with a projector are
going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that
unfinished parts look unfinished.
— Joel Spolsky</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="http://xyproblem.info/">XY Problem</a>. When you’re asking for programming help
from someone, start by easing them into your situation, stating the problem,
your assumptions, and what you’ve tried and learned. Give them the chance to
poke holes in your logic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn’t be asking for help right?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Jon Evans, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/why-the-new-guy-cant-code/">Why The New Guy Can’t
Code</a>. The truth
of this argument has confirmed itself to me over and over again. I think that I
became a programmer on the job. But you can become a programmer right now by
doing just one hard thing: committing to a meaningful project, no matter how
small, and finishing it, in spite of the obstacles you will face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what should a real interview consist of? Let me offer a humble proposal:
don’t interview anyone who hasn’t accomplished anything. Ever. Certificates and
degrees are not accomplishments; I mean real-world projects with real-world
users.
— Jon Evans</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Paul Slaughter, <a href="https://conventionalcomments.org/">Conventional comments</a>. I
believe in code reviews as a technique to raise quality, share information, and
help people grow. But they can go wrong in so many ways and have an almost
opposite effect. This technique– labeling comments to help the recipient
contextualize your feedback– has had a positive impact on several teams I’ve
been a part of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Labeling comments saves hours of undercommunication and misunderstandings.
They are also parseable by machines!
— Paul Slaughter</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Zed Shaw via Abhishek Nagekar, <a href="https://www.nagekar.com/2018/06/advice-from-an-old-programmer-zed-shaw.html">Advice From An Old Programmer</a>. There will
likely come a day when you find programming to be a little bit boring. It will
cease to be joyful as a pure exercise. What do you do then? It’s a question I’m
grappling with. I’m choosing to use that skill to build things I care about,
and help others become programmers through volunteering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good
job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food
joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another
profession.
— Zed Shaw</p>

Business does not. Copying is a zero-sum game and all participating players will compete profits away until they reach a Nash-equilibrium, where a further lowering of price, and thus margins, is unsustainable.

There are certain guidelines successful businesses seem to use but in the end, you’ll still have to go with your gut and make a judgment call according to your own ethical values.</em></p><p>Arguably, replicating findings is one of the best tools we have in our scientific arsenal in order to test the validity of a conclusion.</p><p>Which is why the psychology community was not amused when the methodological crisis now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" target="_blank">Replication crisis</a> started, where it was discovered that many studies weren’t replicable (Nosek et al., 2015).</p><p>Even some of the most cited and well-known studies such as the study that power posing makes you act bolder (Carney, Cuddy &amp; Yap, 2010).</p><p>Which, incidentally, is why it’s so important to not just reference research (instead of parroting some YouTube influencer or blogger) but to also carefully analyze the literature and its limitations yourself. *1</p><p>This doesn’t guarantee perfection, but it does decrease obvious and preventable mistakes.</p><p>JP Ioannidis pointed out serious problems with published research in ‘’Why most published research findings are false.’’</p><blockquote><p>‘’ Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.’’ (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/" target="_blank">Ioannidis, 2005</a>).</p></blockquote><p>Methodological issues aside, replication matters.</p><p>Well, that’s all fine and dandy weren’t it for the pesky fact that our field relies on innovation.</p><p>Even if you extract all the knowledge from the brains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Systrom" target="_blank">Kevin Systrom</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krieger" target="_blank">Mike Krieger </a>and build Instagram, you’d get the complete opposite result because Instagram already exists.</p><p>Even Kevin and Mike can’t replicate it because the variables have changed.</p><p>The entire environment and current social climate (regarding privacy, advertising, users as the product, and social media addiction) are different, and even if it weren’t, no user is gonna switch to an IG clone when IG already exists.</p><p>There are some guidelines that most successful companies seem to follow, however, you can’t formulate a step-by-step plan for the reasons laid out above.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" target="_blank">Peter Thiel</a> was one of the first to point out this distinction between companies that go from 0 to 1, innovation, and companies that go from 1 to n (copying), in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One</a>.</p><p>Companies that do copy and thus employ a formula they copied from another company open themselves up to fierce competition.</p><p>As more players participate in this zero-sum game, the fixed pie of users and profits will get competed away because there are too many mouths to feed with finite resources. *2</p><p>If you copy each other with no (or no meaningful) distinctions then price will be the only thing you can compete on, which is exactly what we see in commodity markets.</p><p>Player B will lower prices in order to steal market share from Player A. Player A lowers them still. Player C lowers it below both of them.

What did you mean by that?</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong>Groupon started out with these really tight principles about how the site was going to work, really being pro-customer. And as we expanded people in the company would say, “Hey, why don’t we try running two deals a day?” “Why don’t we start sending two emails a day?” And I’d think, <em>That sounds awful. Who wants to get two emails every single day from a company. </em>And they’d be like, <em>Sure, it sounds awful to you. But we’re a data-driven company, so why don’t we let the data decide? Why don’t we do a test?</em> And we’d do a test, and it would show that maybe people would unsubscribe at a slightly higher rate, but the increase in purchasing would more than make up for it. You’d get in a situation where it doesn’t feel right, but it does seem like a rational decision.</p><p>The problem was when you’re in hypergrowth like this, you don’t have time to see what is going to happen to the data in the long term. The churn would catch up with you. People would unsubscribe at higher rates, and then, before you know it, the service has just turned into something — if you look at Groupon now, it’s just this vestige of what it once was. There’s no real copywriting. It’s a marketplace of coupons. It’s still a service that a lot of people get a lot of value out of, but it doesn’t have the spirit it once did.</p><p>There are certain things you have to be religious about in the company. That’s what I’ve taken away from that: There are some things where you have to say, “I’m sorry. I’m not going to look at the data on that. This is just what we’re going to do. We know that it’s right, and there’s nothing that’s going to shake us from that.” (Blumberg, 2018).</p></blockquote><p><em>*1 The fact that almost everyone is lazy and assume others have done their homework vs. doing the hard work of checking it themselves is a cognitive error known as </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank"><em>diffusion of responsibility</em></a><em>. ‘’The individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.’’</em></p><p><em>*2 This is often …</em></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <td colspan="3">
            
            <div id="content">
              <p>I have a couple of different stationary computers. A
                custom-built PC running Windows, an iMac G3 running Mac
                OS 9 and an old HP microtower running Alpine Linux,
                acting as a home server of sorts. Out of all these, I
                spend most of my time on the Windows PC. I use Windows
                for the majority of my work, including a large part of
                the programming that I do.<br>
              </p>
              <p>Even though I mainly use Windows, most of my
                web/software development is grounded in or at least
                inspired by Unix in some way: most obviously, I use Git,
                which is a tool designed for the Unix shell. This turns
                out to be a rather awkward match: on the one hand, I use
                Windows Explorer to manage the files; on the other hand,
                I have a command prompt open to manage the repository.</p>
              <p>For my workflow, it would be much better if the Git
                commands were integrated into Explorer itself. So I
                added what amounts to the following code to <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/">my AutoHotKey
                  script</a>: <br>
              </p>

              <p>(The actual code is contained in <a href="http://git.ankarstrom.se/ahk.git/tree/tt.programs.explorer.ahk">this

                  file</a>, most of it near the bottom.) </p>
              <p>This adds a bunch of hotkeys to any Explorer window:</p>
              <dl>
                <dt><b>Alt-A</b></dt>
                <dd>"git add" the selected file; then "git status"<br>
                </dd>

                <dd>"git diff", comparing the previous and current
                  commit</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-I</b></dt>
                <dd>"git diff" the selected file, comparing the previous
                  and current commit</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-L</b></dt>
                <dd>"git log"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-Shift-L</b></dt>
                <dd>"git log" the selected file<br>
                </dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-P</b></dt>
                <dd>"git push"</dd>
                <dt><b>Alt-R</b></dt>

                <dd>"git status"</dd>
              </dl>
              <p>All of these hotkeys open a new command prompt window,
                displaying the results of the Git command, which the
                user can close by pressing any key.</p>
              <p>In my experience, these hotkeys make it incalculably
                less bothersome to work with Git on Windows, and I think
                it shows how incredibly useful even very simple
                AutoHotKey scripts can be. If you have any suggestions
                on other hotkeys, please write a comment below.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We started this series with <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">an overview of the CPython VM</a>. We learned that to run a Python program, CPython first compiles it to bytecode, and we studied how the compiler works in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">part two</a>. <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">Last time</a> we stepped through the CPython source code starting with the <code>main()</code> function until we reached the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. The main reason why we spent time studying these things was to prepare for the discussion that we start today. The goal of this discussion is to understand how CPython does what we tell it to do, that is, how it executes the bytecode to which the code we write compiles.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h3>Starting point</h3>
<p>Let's briefly recall what we learned in the previous parts. We tell CPython what to do by writing Python code. The CPython VM, however, understands only Python bytecode. This is the job of the compiler to translate Python code to bytecode. The compiler stores bytecode in a code object, which is a structure that fully describes what a code block, like a module or a function, does. To execute a code object, CPython first creates a state of execution for it called a frame object. Then it passes a frame object to a frame evaluation function to perform the actual computation. The default frame evaluation function is <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Python/ceval.c#L889">Python/ceval.c</a>. This function implements the core of the CPython VM. Namely, it implements the logic for the execution of Python bytecode. So, this function is what we're going to study today.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> works, it is crucial to have an idea of what its input, a frame object, is. A frame object is a Python object defined by the following C struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// typedef struct _frame PyFrameObject; in other place</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>_frame</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject_VAR_HEAD</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_lines</span><span>;</span>         <span>/* Emit per-line trace events? */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_trace_opcodes</span><span>;</span>       <span>/* Emit per-opcode trace events? */</span>

    <span>/* Borrowed reference to a generator, or NULL */</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>f_gen</span><span>;</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>f_lineno</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* Current line number */</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>f_iblock</span><span>;</span>               <span>/* index in f_blockstack */</span>
    <span>char</span> <span>f_executing</span><span>;</span>           <span>/* whether the frame is still executing */</span>
    <span>PyTryBlock</span> <span>f_blockstack</span><span>[</span><span>CO_MAXBLOCKS</span><span>];</span> <span>/* for try and loop blocks */</span>

<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>f_code</code> field of a frame object points to a code object. A code object is also a Python object. Here's its definition:</p>

<p>The most important field of a code object is <code>co_code</code>. It's a pointer to a Python bytes object representing the bytecode. The bytecode is a sequence of two-byte instructions: one byte for an opcode and one byte for an argument.</p>
<p>Don't worry if some members of the above structures are still a mystery to you. We'll see what they are used for as we move forward in our attempt to understand how the CPython VM executes the bytecode.</p>
<h3>Overview of the evaluation loop</h3>
<p>The problem of executing Python bytecode may seem a no-brainer to you. Indeed, all the VM has to do is to iterate over the instructions and to act according to them. And this is what essentially <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> does. It contains an infinite <code>for (;;)</code> loop that we refer to as the evaluation loop. Inside that loop there is a giant <code>switch</code> statement over all possible opcodes. Each opcode has a corresponding <code>case</code> block containing the code for executing that opcode. The bytecode is represented by an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, one integer per instruction. The VM keeps track of the next instruction to be executed using the <code>next_instr</code> variable, which is a pointer to the array of instructions. At the start of each iteration of the evaluation loop, the VM calculates the next opcode and its argument by taking the least significant and the most significant byte of the next instruction respectively and increments <code>next_instr</code>. The <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()</code> function is nearly 3000 lines long, but its essence can be captured by the following simplified version:</p>

        <span>}</span>

        <span>// ... error handling</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... termination</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a more realistic picture, let's discuss some of the omitted pieces in more detail.</p>
<h4>reasons to suspend the loop</h4>
<p>From time to time, the currently running thread stops executing the bytecode to do something else or to do nothing. This can happen due to one of the four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are signals to handle. When you register a function as a signal handler using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.signal"><code>signal.signal()</code></a>, CPython stores this function in the array of handlers. The function that will actually be called when a thread receives a signal is <code>signal_handler()</code> (it's passed to the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html"><code>sigaction()</code></a> library function on Unix-like systems). When called, <code>signal_handler()</code> sets a boolean variable telling that the function in the array of handlers corresponding to the received signal has to be called. Periodically, the main thread of the main interpreter calls the tripped handlers.</li>
<li>There are pending calls to call. Pending calls is a mechanism that allows to schedule a function to be executed from the main thread. This mechanism is exposed by the Python/C API via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_AddPendingCall"><code>Py_AddPendingCall()</code></a> function.</li>
<li>The asynchronous exception is raised. The asynchronous exception is an exception set in one thread from another. This can be done using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc"><code>PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc()</code></a> function provided by the Python/C API.</li>
<li>The currently running thread is requested to drop the GIL. When it sees such a request, it drops the GIL and waits until it acquires the GIL again.</li>
</ul>
<p>CPython has indicators for each of these events. The variable indicating that there are handlers to call is a member of <code>runtime-&gt;ceval</code>, which is a <code>_ceval_runtime_state</code> struct:</p></div></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_time#Statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American survey,</a> children&nbsp;between the ages of 8-12 and 13-18 spend a daily average of 4 hours, 44 minutes and 7 hours, 22 minutes respectively, staring at screens.</p>
<p>The data for these numbers were collected in 2019. For adults, this figure is higher and according to an article on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/screen-time-iphone-coronavirus-quarantine-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post </a>earlier this year, the amount of screen time increased considerably during the quarantine period due to <strong>COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Today, mobile devices take a large percentage of the amount of time people spend staring at screens, this is why there is a need for applications to have a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> option for its users.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> according to <strong>Wikipedia,</strong><em> is a color scheme that uses light-coloured text, icons, and graphical user interface elements on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design.</em></p>
<p>Now, let us look at the 5 reasons why <strong>Dark Mode</strong> really matters for the end-users of an application!<br>
<a name="reasons-for-dark-mode"></a></p>
<h2>Reasons For Dark Mode</h2>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg" alt="visual appeal" width="1055" height="703" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/visual_apeal.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px"><br>
<a name="visual-attraction"></a></p>
<h3>1). Visual Attraction</h3>
<p><strong>Dark Mode</strong> when applied in the right manner always looks really appealing to the eye. It provides the opportunity to present a unique user interface to the end-users of an application.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of data presentation for graphical contents like dashboards that contain graphs and charts, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> brings out the elegance in the design as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png" alt="Dark Mode" width="1106" height="575" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-300x156.png 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-1024x531.png 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/darkmode-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px"></p>
<p>Unlike the drab white look that most applications have, the above image shows how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> can bring a significantly deeper and more attractive visual perception to an application.<br>
<a name="user-experience"></a></p>
<h3>2). User Experience</h3>
<p>Providing the users of a product with the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is a good business decision, especially if the application requires users to spend lots of time on the application. A streaming site, for example, implementing a dark mode feature is a good business decision.</p>
<p>Streaming a video in <strong>light-mode</strong> under a dark environment or at night may not be a good experience for the eyes. Hence, applications that require people spending lots of screen time should provide an option for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> for a better user experience.</p>
<p>Above all, it is worthy to note that context is a key factor in making decisions on whether to implement the option of a <strong>Dark Mode</strong>.<br>
<a name="eye-strain"></a></p>
<h3>3). Eye Strain &amp; Blue Light Removal</h3>
<p>By default, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce overall screen brightness. Although no study has outrightly confirmed that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> reduces eye strain, it can, however, be effective in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> helps to reduce exposure to <strong>Blue Light.</strong>&nbsp;Blue light is a high-frequency colour in the “visible light spectrum” that can be seen by the human eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg" alt="blue-light" width="990" height="660" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-768x512.jpg 768w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blue-light.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px"></p>
<p><strong>Blue Light&nbsp;</strong>can be found almost everywhere, from smartphones to computers and other digital devices. Another source of Blue Light is the sun, so by stepping out of your house, you are exposed to a certain degree of blue light.</p>
<p>Too many exposures to Blue Light can lead to digital eye strain.</p>
<p>Since not everyone can see well with <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, some mobile devices provide the option for Blue Light filters. This can be found in the display settings area and can be easily adjusted to the level of blue light exposure you want.<br>
<a name="reduction-of-photophobia"></a></p>
<h3>4). Reduction of Photophobia</h3>
<p>Photophobia is a symptom of abnormal intolerance to the visual perception of light. The source of this light could be any form of light source including sunlight.</p>
<p>There are so many things that can cause photophobia, some of which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive light entering the eyes</li>
<li>Eye infection</li>
<li>Medications</li>
<li>Meningitis</li>
<li>Lack of eye pigment (Albinism)</li>
<li>Wearing contact lenses for an extended period of time, or wearing it wrongly.</li>
<li>Post Eye Surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>Photophobia usually disappears once the underlying cause is treated. A good way to deal with photophobia is making use of the <strong>Dark Mode </strong>of a mobile device or an application. This helps to reduce the amount of bright light that goes directly into the eyes.</p>
<p>An extension you may consider installing on your desktop browser is &nbsp;<a href="https://nighteye.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Night Eye</a>. It is supported by almost all major web browsers. It helps you enable <strong>Dark Mode </strong>and other features across almost all the websites you view, to help cope with the light sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, if light sensitivity persists, you may want to see your doctor!<br>
<a name="battery-saver"></a></p>
<h3>5). Battery Saver</h3>
<p>Another positive impact of <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is the impact it has on the battery life of mobile devices. <strong>Dark Mode </strong>can significantly help reduce the battery drain on devices which use OLED(Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg" alt="battery-saver" width="952" height="1393" srcset="https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-205x300.jpg 205w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-699x1024.jpg 699w, https://thecodeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/battery-saver-768x1125.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></p>
<p>Numerous studies have confirmed the fact that <strong>Dark Mode</strong> saves battery life. In an<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UljafaxRcEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Android Dev Summit</a> in November of 2018, Google also confirmed that themes on android devices have a significant impact on the battery life of a mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are using an Android device, you should consider using <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, especially at night. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but it also helps save your battery life.<br>
<a name="factors-to-consider"></a></p>
<h3>Factors To Consider When Selecting Dark Mode</h3>
<p>In as much as <strong>Dark Mode</strong> seems trendy, it is necessary to consider some factors before deciding to implement it in an application. Some of these factors are discussed below:</p>
<p><strong>Readability and Visibility:&nbsp;</strong>Readability simply means the ease at which a reader can easily understand or perceive a written text. Applications that contain lots of text in their interface will have to be careful about how <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is implemented.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is not well implemented, this will lead to a poor user experience with the users struggling to read the texts. This defeats one of the purposes for which <strong>Dark Mode</strong> is created and could lead to eye strain.</p>
<p>Lots of research must go into how the backgrounds, text colour and font will work together.</p>
<p><strong>Test Before Implementation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Testing helps to discover the strength and weakness of the Color scheme used in an application. <strong>Dark Mode</strong> does not work well for all applications. A website that contains lots of elements(text, images, tables) may make it difficult for <strong>Dark Mode</strong> to be implemented.</p>
<p>Other factors to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of the target audience</li>
<li>Providing an option to switch between Light Mode and Dark Mode</li>
<li>The Environment</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The decision to always use <strong>Dark Mode </strong>should always be a relative one. For users of an application, knowing when to use light mode and <strong>Dark Mode </strong>at different times of the day is very essential for the eye.</p>

            <p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After a very, very long delay, here comes finally another development report about the <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/BIM_Workbench">BIM tools</a> for <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>. Awfully sorry about the black-out during these last months, lots of things <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/liege/detail_circuit-de-spa-francorchamps-80-millions-d-investissements-et-le-retour-de-la-moto?id=10604892">happened</a> (all the 3D&amp;BIM done with FreeCAD and Blender) and  of course the pandemic didn't ease things either. Anyway, that doesn't mean nothing happened on the FreeCAD front, on the contrary, bugs still get addressed, things get fin-tuned, ideas get discussed, and FreeCAD gets everyday better.</p>
<p>This last month we also had a hectic turnover, because Autodesk changed the terms of the free version of  their <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview">Fusion360</a>. There is a full load of new limitations that restrain much the use for personal/hobby users. For example, the g-code you export from Fusion360 to CNC machines (that cut objects out of a block of material), is now making the machine running slower (and therefore raising the production costs), for no apparent reason other than nagging the users into buying a subscription. As a result, we saw a massive migration of users to FreeCAD, and it's really thrilling to see people discovering FreeCAD and learning it and liking it.</p>
<p>Thanks once more to everybody who contributes to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yorikvanhavre">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://liberapay.com/yorik/">Liberapay</a> campaigns, I'm really grateful you guys didn't just drop me away when I fail to write for 3 months.</p>
<p>Also, for who didn't notice, FreeCAD now has a proper <a href="https://liberapay.com/FreeCAD/">Liberapay teams account</a> where all money received is divided equally between the FreeCAD developers registered there (currently 7). This account has seen a huge raise of donations these last weeks (it receives around 1000 USD/month at the moment), thanks to the flow of new ex-Fusion360 users, and the impressive job Kunda1 is doing on <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeCADNews">the official FreeCAD twitter account</a> (subscribe to it if you are a twitter user, that account used to be just a mirror of the FreeCAD Facebook page, but is now very, very well maintained) and the campaigning of other people (special thanks to my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/beatnikqueen">girlfriend</a>, the most awesome person in the world).</p>
<p>So, no more loitering, to the news! Here is what we got this month:</p>
<h3>Customizable section color</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SetMaterial">Materials</a> now have a new <strong>Section Color</strong> property, which allows to give a different color when the material is viewed and when it is cut through. So for example you can now have your walls appear white when viewed, but black when cut and seen on a TechDraw page.</p>
<p>This is a small improvement so far, but it laid the structure to have more advanced things, such as supporting hatch patterns. The main problem for this, is that, although the SVG format has an excellent support for hatch patterns (anything can become a hatch pattern, even bitmap images), the Qt implementation of the SVG format lacks support for it (it has its own <a href="https://doc.qt.io/Qt-5/qbrush.html#details">system</a> but it's not very practical to make that compatible with SVG). Therefore at the moment we have no clear idea of how to go further.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_Module">TechDraw</a>'s implementation of hatch patterns internally recreates OpenCasCade geometry, which works very well but might be heavy for large BIM models. In any case, that's a track I'm <a href="https://github.com/yorikvanhavre/FreeCAD/tree/td-makedrawgeomhatch">exploring</a> too.</p>
<h3>Default windows are now openable</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another very small fix, but the default door and windows created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Window">Door and windows tools</a> now have a hinge edge defined, so their <strong>Opening</strong> property now works out-of-the-box. It might not open in the direction you want, though, so you might still need to tweak this. But next items on my list are adding a couple of controls to easily switch opening directions.</p>
<h3>Default pattern size option</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Draft patterns system is now working again (hatch patterns can be added to all closed Draft objects such as rectangles, polylines, circles, etc). I also added a preferences option under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Visual settings</em> to set a default hatch pattern scale, which is useful when you always work with objects of a similar size range, for example building plans. I still have to experiment a bit (0.0025 seems like a very good default setting for BIM), but will add that to the BIM setup screen once I found a couple of good settings.</p>
<h3>Section plane label</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_SectionPlane">Section planes</a> now have a <strong>Show Label</strong> property, which, when turned on, show the section plane label on the plane in the 3D view. This is useful to easily identify these section planes when there are many in your document. The text size currently depends on the arrow size, but I'll make all this better customizable later on.</p>
<p>We have further plans too for the section planes, such as be able to double-click or activate them somehow, and find yourself in a separate 2D view with all needed geometry cut or turned off, where you can still work on the model in a 2D environment. This would be a bit like an intermediary step between the full 3D model and a TechDraw view. You can see a first draft of that coded by Carlo Pavan on the experimental tools palette in the BIM workbench.</p>
<h3>TechDraw tools in BIM workbench</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Among the annotation tools on the BIM workbench, you'll now find two TechDraw tools, <strong>Create page</strong> and <strong>Create view</strong>. The first one is the same of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_PageTemplate">Create page from template</a> TechDraw tool, except that it remembers the last template you used and gets you right there when you use the tool again, so it gives a little bit faster workflow. The second tool is currently the same as the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/TechDraw_ArchView">TechDraw ArchView tool</a> but I plan to make it a bit more flexible in the future so it would become a mix of TechDraw's ArchView and DraftView tools, depending on the selected objects.</p>
<h3>TSV export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Arch_Schedule">Schedule</a> tool has been extended to now allow to export results to the .tsv (Tab-Separated Values) format, which is basically the same as the .csv (Comma-Separated Values) format, but using tab characters to separate columns, instead of commas. The big problem of csv, of course, is if there are commas in the columns texts. Usually spreadsheet apps are pretty tolerant with .csv files, they will usually ask you what character to consider as column separator on import, but others (for example GitHub) doesn't display them correctly if they don't use a comma as separator. So from now on there is a correct way to please everybody <i></i></p>
<h3>Blender exporter upgrade</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/yorikvanhavre/029f6fcce9f4d0e62fb6163804b7f80d">FreeCAD exporter for Blender</a> has seen several small fixes, it now automatically adds the .FCStd extension to the generated file if you haven't added it yourself, it now correctly handles object rotation and scaling, and it applies modifiers before exporting. It now also supports faceless objects (wireframe objects).</p>
<p>This coupled with the <a href="https://blenderbim.org/">BlenderBIM</a> improvements, it now becomes increasingly easy to work on BIM models in Blender, or parts of BIM models, and when needed, integrate everything seamlessly in FreeCAD. There are many more joint FreeCAD/Blender developments going on, such as the new <a href="https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?style=4&amp;t=51069&amp;p=438881">Sverchok nodes</a> that use FreeCAD internally, literally creating a kind of new interface for FreeCAD withing Blender.</p>
<h3>Detect and suggest development version</h3>
<p>The BIM workbench will now detect your FreeCAD version on the setup screen, and suggest you to install a development version if you are not using one. This will help people to be aware of the existence of development versions, and become more used to them and how to install and mange them.</p>
<h3>Grid extension setting in Working Plane panel</h3>
<p>The overall size of the grid is now settable directly from the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_SelectPlane">Working Plane</a> task panel.</p>
<h3>Multiple custom folders on start page</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-08.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Start_Workbench">start page</a> can now show multiple custom folders. To achieve that, go to the start page preferences under menu <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Start</em> and instead of choosing one custom folder, type manually several folder paths, separated by ;;</p>
<p>For example: <code>/home/yorik;;/home/yorik/Examples;;/home/yorik/FreeCAD/Examples</code></p>
<h3>Image Plane scaling</h3>
<p><img src="https://yorik.uncreated.net/images/2020/freecad-09-09.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Draft_Scale">Draft Scale</a> tool now support image planes created with the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Module">Image workbench</a>. So it is now easy to import reference images such as scanned floor plans, position them on a common reference point, and scale them to the desired size.</p>
<h3>Unit and Show Unit in Draft dimension preferences</h3>
<p>You can now set default value for these two settings under <em>Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Draft -&gt; Dimensions and Texts</em>, that will affect all newly created dimensions.</p>
<h3>Manual upgrade</h3>
<p>And last but not least, I started upgrading the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual">manual</a> to FreeCAD 0.19, and this time I intend well to produce a printed book with it. To be continued!</p>
<p>That's it for this month I guess, I promise to do everything I can to resume posting once per month!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Yorik</p>

Or, switch off video."</p><p>"I need to take a break, and have enough time to play one game of FIFA."</p><p>"How the hell is she so motivated and well dressed every day? I can hardly get out of bed and brush my teeth before the first meeting."</p><p>"I am tired already, will anyone notice if I log off at 2 PM?"</p><p>👆 is a snapshot of the thoughts I've had in the last 30+ weeks of work from home. The actual list is much longer, but let's not go there.</p><p>For almost six weeks now, I have felt that my productivity is lesser than what it was earlier. But the thing with productivity is that there is no scientific measure for it, nor is there a universal scale to determine how productive is productive enough for a superstar PM. (Yes, I think of myself as a superstar PM 😛)</p><p>To give some meaning to the said feeling, I decided to investigate further.</p><p>The goal was to design a system to measure my productivity, identify factors that negatively affect it and develop a method to keep it high.</p><p>TLDR:</p><ol><li>My mood at the end of the workday is a representation of how productive I was on that day - &nbsp;good mood equals a highly productive day. A low <em>task completion rate</em> and <em>high task completion time</em> negatively affected my productivity and my mood.</li><li>I lose focus more easily working from home than working from the office. This has a direct impact on the completion rate and completion time. I, then, identified the triggers that lead me to lose focus. [Read questions at the top.]</li><li>I researched productivity hacks and shortlisted the ones that I think could work for me.</li></ol><p>Deep dive:</p><h2 id="how-to-measure-productivity">How to measure productivity?</h2><p>There is no easy way for me to estimate productivity objectively. And that doesn't worry me. So I chose to limit the measures to subjective criteria like work-related mood and a sense of achievement at the end of the day.</p><p>I am the only one measuring my productivity. There are no external persons who can influence the measurement. Most importantly, I have no incentive to cheat or to justify it to anyone. Hence, this system works. It helps me track directional changes to productivity. As long as I am progressing in the right direction, I am happy.</p><h2 id="why-do-i-lose-focus-more-often-at-home-vs-the-office">Why do I lose focus more often at home vs the office?</h2><p>There are too many variables at home. [Read questions at the top.]</p><p>There is no standard start and end to my day. I start 15 minutes before my first meeting and only stop when I am exhausted. Not having an end time makes me more lenient about micro deadlines. And that leniency triggers the part of the brain which prefers getting distracted.</p><p>This was very different in a physical office.</p><ul><li><strong>The 20-minute commute to the office</strong> helped me prepare for my day, and the commute back helped me unwind and shutdown. The commute primed me to switch on and off, with enough prep time on both ends.

I highly recommend it. I am more efficient with my tasks when there is a timer counting down. For those who are not aware - the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It breaks down work into intervals of 25 minutes in length. Each interval, known as the Pomodoro, is separated by a short break (typically of 5 minutes).</li><li>I am not fond of being late. Ever. I use that to my advantage by <strong>creating and advertising time-bound goals</strong>. For example, suppose the engineers need a document by Friday. In that case, I commit (in front of the entire team) to deliver it by Wednesday. The ambition to fulfil my commitments keeps me focused for longer periods of time.</li><li><strong>Having something to look forward to at the end of the day</strong> keeps me efficient all day. I play football on Wednesday evenings, and miraculously I am the most productive on Wednesdays.</li><li><strong>A comfortable home office is quintessential. </strong>The most important part of the home office - something that I learned the hard way - is a comfortable chair. If you don't already have one, buy one right now. Thank me later.</li><li><strong>Keep your home office organized and clean</strong>.

October 31, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1978 Japan's <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E7%9C%81">Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry</a>
established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still
serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the
JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the
added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant
or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These
are what came to be known as the ghost characters
(<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97">幽霊文字</a>).</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/ghostcanvas.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/ghostcanvas.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>Be careful what you write. <a href="http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1312837">via the NDL</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>For a long time the ghost characters remained an unexplained and mostly
forgotten curiosity, but in 1997 an investigation was launched to discover
where they had come from.  While all characters in the JIS standard were
supposed to have a record of their sources, even when it existed it
wasn't very specific, typically just listing the document it was sourced from.</p>
<p>You'd think that listing the source would make tracking down the origins of the
characters easy, but it's important to clarify what counts as a "source" - one
of the more common sources for the ghost characters was the "Overview of
National Administrative Districts" (国土行政区画総覧), a comprehensive list of
place names in Japan. You might, as I initially did, imagine this to be a kind
of atlas, an oversize book with at most a few hundred pages. It turns out the
<a href="http://kokudo.or.jp/books/index.html">latest edition</a> is a seven volume set
with each volume having roughly nine hundred pages. Imagine tracking down a
single character without a page reference.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulty, the investigation into the ghost characters was
successful in discovering their origins - mostly. By interviewing the
catalogers involved in the creation of the standard, the investigators
established that some characters were inadvertently invented as mistakes in the
cataloging process. For example, 妛 was an error introduced while trying to
record "山 over 女". "山 over 女" occurs in the name of a particular place and
was thus suitable for inclusion in the JIS standard, but because they couldn't
print it as one character yet, 山 and 女 were printed separately, cut out, and
pasted onto a sheet of paper, and then copied. When reading the copy, the line
where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to
the character by mistake. The original character
(<a href="https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%A1%9A%B4">𡚴</a>) was not added to JIS or
Unicode until much later and doesn't display on most sites for me.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/yuureimoji.png"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/yuureimoji.png.l.png"></a><figcaption>The core ghost characters: 妛挧暃椦槞蟐袮閠駲墸壥彁
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the end only one character had neither a clear source nor any historical
precedent: 彁. The most likely explanation is that it was created as a
misreading of the 彊 character, but no specific incident was uncovered.</p>
<p>Following the general adoption of the JIS standards these characters all made
their way into Unicode, which has its own <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK%E7%B5%B1%E5%90%88%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97#%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97">separate set of ghost
characters</a>
introduced during CJK unification.</p>
<p>To sum up - in 1978 a series of small mistakes created some characters out of
nothing. The errors went undiscovered just long enough to be set in stone, and
now these ghosts are, at least in potential, a part of every computer on the
planet, lurking in the dark corners of character tables.</p>
<p>At this rate they'll presumably be with humanity forever. Ψ</p>

So that’s very concrete,” he said. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>“Everyone is enthusiastic. People are thinking this is the light at the end of the tunnel. Let’s go for it,” Levi added.</p><p>Several thousand staff at the University College London Hospitals, which Levi leads, are participating in the Phase 3 study of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Levi himself also got an injection. “I had pain in my arm for two days, muscle pain. Thirty percent of people get a little fever, like the flu. That is why it is also advisable to take paracetamol before vaccination. But the staff are doing well,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who has any major complaints.”</p><p>In the Western world, the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer are the furthest along in developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Levi said that “everything indicates that these two vaccines have a good immune response against the <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/your-cough-cloud-is-7-to-23-times-larger-when-youre-not-wearing-a-mask/">coronavirus</a> and are safe.”</p><h2>Calculated risks</h2><p>“I don’t think it’s rocket science,” <a href="https://www.ad.nl/wetenschap/doe-niet-zo-krampachtig-en-breng-het-coronavaccin-nu-al-op-de-markt~a1526f7c/">Levi told the newspaper</a>. “AstraZeneca’s Oxford vaccine is now being tested on 50,000 people, and one person has experienced a serious side effect but has also recovered. Contrast that to the many hundreds of people who die every day, to hospitals that are filling up. And the only remedy we have now is shutting down society. Shouldn’t we have the courage to say: we will release it?”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>“You take a certain risk by releasing the vaccine now. But it is a limited, very small risk,” he said. “And you take that because the alternative is much worse. Let’s assume there’s a 1 in 50,000 risk of a serious side effect with the Oxford vaccine. The chance that you will have a traffic accident in the Netherlands is 1 in 1000 per year. Nobody is talking about that. You have to put things in perspective.”</p><p>In the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.government.nl/government/members-of-cabinet/hugo-de-jonge">Health Minster Hugo de Jonge</a> has taken a more cautious approach. He has said that a vaccine is unlikely to become available in the Netherlands before the first months of 2021.</p><p>“If there are images from England of rows of people getting vaccinated,” Levi said, “then I think it will happen everywhere, including in the Netherlands.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>I feel like I should start off this blog post by mentioning that I am a Product Designer with little to no development skills, so I heavily rely on no-code tools to get my side projects up and running.</code></p>
<p>The idea of creating something that thousands of users could potentially use was just so exciting to me. Over the course of just shy of a year, I worked on 2 projects that made me less than $20, <strong>combined</strong>, so I feel like it's safe to say I can share my experience with you guys and hopefully you'll learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p> <img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604131920818/D9DxXPfJk.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Custom Size – 3.png"></p>
<p>Oof, designtarget was a wild ride. On 18-8-2019, god knows what happened but I just hopped on Namecheap and purchased the domain <a href="http://designtarget.org/" target="_blank">designtarget.org</a> with no prior experience in web development. I was just so into the idea of creating the 'ultimate design directory' that I really didn't think anything through. How would I monetize the platform? Do I even have a list of resources that I can work with? Where will I market the website? So many questions, and little to no answers.</p>
<p>I remembered seeing an ad for a visual editor plugin on Wordpress called Elementor, it seemed intuitive so I go to Namecheap's cPanel and install Wordpress, purchase a year's subscription to Elementor and I get building. Literally next day I was done, I didn't think the design through, I just wanted to get an MVP out right away, and this atrociousness was born, but I was proud of it. I had no web development knowledge and I made a website, and it felt great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132243316/TKr68CyWaA.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Web 1920 – 1.png"></p>
<p>Naturally, I wanted people to see what I had built, so I go on Reddit and post the website on /r/webdev - no it wasn't a Saturday(you can only post your work on Feedback Saturday on /r/webdev), yes the post was locked. But that doesn't matter, why you ask?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604132936013/UONs_j1_Z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p>8.5k visitors in less than 2 hours of being on reddit when I wasn't supposed to. I knew I was onto something, but a little after the hype died down, it dawned on me, I just missed a huge chance to build an audience. I rushed creating the website that I missed some essentials such as <strong>creating a newsletter sign up</strong> or even just a <strong>blog</strong>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward a few months, I eventually create a newsletter, Instagram page, and even a blog. </p>
<p>📧 ~300 newsletter subscribers.</p>
<p>📸 ~400 Instagram followers.</p>
<p>and most importantly, my blogs were ranking on Google. I don't have Search Console screenshots but I had ranked around ~11th or so for a few articles. </p>
<p>I had solved the traffic problem of any side project, but monetization was where this project went downhill. I simply had no monetization plan whatsoever. And this is where the story of designtarget, ends, well, I sold off the project for a measly amount but that was it.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 No matter how excited you are, keep cool and think things through.</p>
<p>👉 Traffic is easy, business is hard. </p>
<p>👉 Think things through, but also do not spend much time working on an MVP.</p>
<p>👉 It is fine to not know what you're doing.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604133785236/39YjxeLlg.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="screencapture-moeminm-github-io-goodcode-2020-10-31-10_42_27.png"></p>
<p>This one is close to my heart, it really is. You can read my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">post on IndieHackers</a> to know why I stopped working on Good Code.</p>
<p>The idea originally came to me when I discovered  <a target="_blank" href="http://frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a>, by then I had learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript and wanted to improve my skills. I liked FEM, but the free templates were just not the level of design I wanted to work on, queue Good Code.</p>
<p>This time, I was ready, monetization plan was straight-forward, content was ready, community building was in place, newsletter was in place. I cook up a static version of the website using HTML and CSS and release it on Github Pages, you can view Good Code  <a target="_blank" href="https://moeminm.github.io/goodcode">here</a> and straight to reddit I go (and IndieHackers this time as well). </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604134249747/BPvkUcJ5j.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 2.png"></p>
<p>September 3rd, to September 15th. I was onto something, again. Shortly after launching, I view my Gumroad page only to find 2 customers have purchased templates for a total of $10. My first internet money! </p>
<p>I also had people posting their solutions on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCodeChallenge/">subreddit</a>  I created just for this website, it felt great.</p>
<p>I really wanted to continue working on Good Code, as it stands, it's only hosted on GH Pages, so there's a good chance there <em>could</em> have been more sales had it been on an actual domain. I might resume working on Good Code in a future date, but for now, I'm pausing for reasons listed in the  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/good-code/temporarily-pausing-work-on-good-code--MKnKtlnidKMGLMQAuyr">IndieHackers post</a>. </p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned:</h3>
<p>👉 Spin ideas. I could have just released this as just another website selling Adobe XD templates, but I feel like the 'improve your HTML and CSS skills' twist was what brought this to life.</p>
<p>👉 Create a community for your side-project.</p>
<p> 👉 Don't be afraid to shut down.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, had I not started designtarget, I wouldn't have learned how to code (albeit being bad at it), had I not learned how to code, I wouldn't have started Good Code and made my first $ from a side-project, who knows what my next had I not started is going to be, but I feel like it might be success.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last years I’ve been working on very different operating
systems. Operating systems are usually incredibly complex beasts. I
think there are mainly three drivers of this complexity. Surprisingly
enough, neither of these is having to deal with hardware.</p>

<p>The first one is resource <strong>discovery</strong>, i.e. figuring out how the
computer the OS is running on actually looks like. On x86, this
involves parsing countless bitfields, tables, executing byte code
provided by the firmware, probing individual features, etc. The most
painful example of this I’ve seen so far is figuring out which
interrupt a particular PCI interrupt line is routed to. It’s worth a
set of posts, but until then, feel free to checkout <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/501912/">this
description</a>. (If it’s down, it’s
also cached by
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:CXZUV61m7hwJ:https://habr.com/en/post/501912/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk">Google</a>.)</p>

<p>The second issue is <strong>resource management</strong>. Essentially, how do you
hand out and eventually reclaim all the resources you discovered. For
some workloads performance matters here, so this code is usually
written with speed in mind.</p>

<p>The third reason is that at compile time the <strong>workload</strong> is
unclear. So the kernel has to assume the worst. It must be ready to
start a couple of hundred VMs or create a thousand TCP sockets in a
blink of an eye, because there is no way to know what’s going to
happen or what the actual requirements are.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to checkout the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/virt/kvm/kvm_main.c#L739">KVM code for creating
VMs</a>. Try
to follow
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/x86.c#L9904">the</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.1/source/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c#L7059">code</a>
to where the actual VM is created in hardware. <em>Spoiler:</em> There is
none. It’s all figuring out what the platform can do and then setting
up a bunch of spinlock, mutexes, lists, arrays, structs, …</p>

<p>I don’t want to pick on KVM in particular. I think it’s pretty ok as
far as Linux kernel code goes. Operating System kernel code is mostly
like this: A lot of really mind numbing platform discovery and
resource management code written for speed assuming the worst case
requirements in a language that doesn’t do parsing, resource
management or concurrency well (among other things).</p>

<p>People take this all for granted. But when I look around, I see many
systems that don’t need this complexity and where it is only a safety
and security burden. Consider most appliance-type products, e.g. a
Wi-Fi router. Or a system that runs one service on a cloud VM. You
know everything in advance!</p>

<p>If you read until this point, you are probably asking yourself, where
I am going with this. If you think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_kernel">separation
kernel</a>, you are
right. My rough plan to write a couple of more posts to flesh out the
idea of doing all the complicated OS parts at compile time and how
this results in an incredibly simple, secure, and efficient system at
runtime. There will be <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>,
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> content.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

October 31, 2020 | https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<p><small>Compiled on the basis of the original list presented here: <i><a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of genius and creativity</a></i>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> (2001)</small>
</p>
<h2><span id="How_to_become_a_genius">How to become a genius</span></h2>
<p>A majority of people carry the potential to become a genius. There are factors that are far <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_formula_for_high_intelligence" title="Simple formula for high intelligence">more important than genes and IQ</a>. I have compiled a checklist that I believe should work, when followed. All you need to begin with is to be free and reasonably healthy. I try to list the factors that prevent many people from accomplishing their greatest potential. The list begins with the stumbling blocks that are most likely to occur on one's road to genius. Some factors need to be balanced against each other, and some factors overlap. For example, the first three preconditions of genius are strongly related: freedom from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a>, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">good sleep</a>, and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. They may provide the key to answering why we are not (yet) a planet of geniuses. I listed individual points separately on the basis of their ability to motivate and inspire. Before you start reading, however, remember what Herbert Simon said about genius: it takes about ten years to develop it. Not only will you have to meet all the criteria listed below, but lots of hard work and patience will be required before you climb that summit!
</p>
<p>If you follow these rules religiously, you will be amazed by how much progress you can make in a decade</p> 
<p>If I scare you with a decade-long time-frame, remember that chances are good that you will love your self-transformation in weeks. The younger you are, the 'messier' your life, the less you know about your future, the more powerful the effect.
</p>
<h3><span id="Eliminate_stress">Eliminate stress</span></h3>
<p>Stress is understood here as rapid change resulting in an increase in stress hormones (catecholamines, ACTH, cortisol, etc.). Stressful change can come from conflict, illness, the death of a relative, or unemployment. Stress can also result from seemingly happy events such as a wedding or a hasty vacation. A simple test here is to make sure that creative problems circulate in your mind while you are brushing your teeth. You will fail the test if, instead of creative thinking, you are preoccupied with problems at work or in the family. Stress will dramatically cut down your creative efficiency. Most of all, it will affect your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>: another cornerstone of genius. In addition, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress" title="Chronic stress">chronic stress</a> will result in excess cortisol, increased activity in the sympathetic system, and a resulting inhibition of neurogenesis, memory consolidation, creativity, and more. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">Stress resilience</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Sleep">Sleep</span></h3>
<p>Make sure to always get as much quality sleep as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">your brain requires</a>. The simplest first step is: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Kill_the_alarm_clock" title="Kill the alarm clock">throw away your alarm clock</a>! Lack of sleep delivers a quadruple whammy: (1) it suppresses memory consolidation, (2) it prevents <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">memory optimization</a>, (3) it makes you unwilling to exert mental effort, and (4) it undermines your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">self-discipline</a>. Submit to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle" title="Natural creativity cycle">natural creativity cycle</a>. For more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">Science of sleep</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</span></h3>
<p>Lack of self-discipline aggravated by stress and a lack of sleep is the number one cause of low productivity. The trick to achieving good self-discipline is to make incremental progress, and convert discipline into a habit and then into the pleasure of productivity (for more see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline" title="Self-discipline">Self-discipline</a>).
If you develop healthy self-discipline habits early, your life is likely to take an entirely different course. If you believe you are lacking in this field, try the following exercise: as soon as a valuable activity comes to your mind that you are really unwilling to do, <b>do it</b>. Within the scope and in agreement with human biology, your rational brain must be the master of your decision making. Stand over a pool of cold water. Do you hate jumping in? The more you hate it, the sooner you should jump. And in the end you will <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Winter_swimming" title="Winter swimming">love it</a>. A cold shower is a minor inconvenience once you experience the volitional power of the brain. You need to master the skill of perfect execution of your own plans. The more precise your plan, the harder it is to execute, yet the more tangible the results. Learn to delay gratification. If you focus on your long-term goals, your daily inconveniences will be more bearable or even pleasurable. A strenuous quest towards the goal is the best reward for a genius mind. Minor awards of laziness do not befit a true genius. Think of self-discipline daily. Even the strongest minds can relax it all too easily. Remember about stress and sleep. Stress and sleepiness are chief factors that undermine self-discipline. Self-discipline cannot quarrel with biology. In extreme cases, it can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks" title="War of the networks">undermine your genius</a>. If you are sick, stop working. If you are sleepy, go to sleep. For comfort, you should know, that with each passing year, self-discipline will gradually transform into a pleasure. Not only will you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Plan" title="Plan">execute your plans instinctively</a>, you will also reap the benefits of your earlier efforts to steer your life in a good direction. In later years, you will not need much self-discipline to employ your genius mind to do good things.
</p>
<h3><span id="Learn_day_and_night">Learn day and night</span></h3>
<p>Knowledge is the substance you <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">convert to great ideas</a>. Although it is possible to learn in stress or in a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deficit</a>, learning is listed here behind stress, sleep and self-discipline. This is because humans exhibit <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">inborn curiosity</a> that makes them crave learning. TV, tabloid press, and social media thrive on this need for learning. Most people understand the importance of learning but are prevented from executing their plans due to stress, lack of sleep or lack of self-discipline. To breed genius, your whole life should revolve around learning. You should use every single little opportunity to learn important things. This could be reading Einstein's biography or talking with a homeless person. Read, talk, watch, surf, and keep on thinking. Do not avoid hard subjects (e.g. mathematics). Mold your learning strictly to your creative needs, but do not fail to explore a wide range of topics. Touch all the bases and avoid tunnel vision! Remember that your success in learning will require appropriate <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">knowledge representation</a> and timing of review (as in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>). Are you lacking a university education? <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_dropouts" title="School dropouts">Never mind</a>. Look at Edison, Lincoln, or Leibnitz to see the power of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-learning" title="Self-learning">self-instruction</a>. All the seemingly contradictory requirements listed above can be reconciled if you structure your learning with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>. See: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Advantages_of_incremental_reading" title="Advantages of incremental reading">Advantages of incremental reading</a>
</p>
<h3><span id="Abstract_knowledge">Abstract knowledge</span></h3>
<p>Except for a great deal of learning, you will need to pay attention to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">quality of knowledge</a> and its general <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a>. You cannot just memorize thousands of facts. You have to consciously explore areas such as logic, probability, statistics, game theory, decision theory, computing sciences, optimization, as well as other branches of mathematics and sciences. You have to develop a love for logical thinking, the scientific method, and skepticism. Even if you are a movie critic, you will still need quality logic to frame your judgment. Remember that all knowledge is volatile and may be subject to falsification at any time. Keep your mind open to new truths even if they seem to turn your present vision of the world upside down
</p>
<h3><span id="Knowledge_representation">Knowledge representation</span></h3>
<p>The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">quality knowledge</a> in a way that is <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">easy to remember</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">easy to use</a>. A genius mind can see complex things in a simple form. It looks at the same text or picture and sees a dozen times more than an average individual. An average reader will say: <i>"I understand, so what?"</i>. A genius reader will say: <i>"Eureka!"</i>, and list several applications of the just acquired piece of knowledge. Geniuses simplify while learning. They <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization" title="Generalization">generalize</a>. They build <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract models</a>. They develop abstract languages for representing knowledge. Those representation skills can also be developed by training. Have you ever tried to learn Kanji (Japanese language symbols)? If you see Kanji as a tangle of confused sticks, you are a typical beginner. Over time, however, Kanji symbols should begin to sing to you and talk to you in their own language. Once you pass the first few hundred, the next thousand should go smoothly. The same happens if you learn the 20x20 multiplication table. With time you learn simple tricks for running simple and repetitive calculations. Instead of memorizing 20x20 combinations, you limit yourself to a standard 10x10 table (just 25% of all combinations) and add to this a few rules for manipulating numbers in your <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Working_memory" title="Working memory">working memory</a>. The best way to develop good representations is to (1) understand the way the memory works (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules" title="20 rules">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>), (2) consciously modify representations in the learning process (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a> supports this process naturally) (3) work on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> (the more you learn the easier it becomes), and (4) get <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep" title="Good sleep">good sleep</a> to employ <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Neural optimization in sleep">neural optimization in sleep</a>. If you encounter a difficult problem in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading" title="Incremental reading">incremental reading</a>, postpone it. With luck, some other information source will present to you a better representation that is easier to assimilate.
</p>
<h3><span id="Health">Health</span></h3>
<p>Take obsessive care of your health! Keep your blood pressure down (high blood pressure damages your brain), do not <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Impact_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Impact of alcohol on sleep">abuse alcohol</a> (any dose that visibly affects your mental performance may be poisonous to your brain), use medication only when absolutely necessary, exercise, stay away from smoking or illicit drugs, learn medical sciences!!! Your brain is a highly sensitive organ that needs a healthy environment to operate in. Health and understanding of the biological needs of your brain may dramatically affect your performance in the long run. Don't waste time on <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Formula_for_common_cold_prevention" title="Formula for common cold prevention">colds and flu</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>October 25, 2020</p></header><section><h3>Problem</h3>
<p>It’s very common while building any project we use certain third party libraries, in the case of Javascript; <code>npm packages</code>, which recursively use more packages, and eventually your code includes a huge chunk of third party code.<br>
There is nothing wrong with it, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. We include the required library, make our code work, write tests. Deploy to a staging environment, pass through automation and finally deploy to production.  </p>
<p>The problem is when a library tries to load remote content on our website. It can be an image, font, style, or even Javascript. This content bypasses all our tests, checks, and is executed directly on production. Even worse we don’t know where the content is being served from.</p>
<h3>Content Security Policy</h3>
<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/">W3C specification</a> that helps to avoid <code>XSS</code> attacks. CSP enables developers to define rules for fetching the resources(images, javascript, fonts, etc.) on the client browser. Developers can define policies to allow/restrict loading any resource, restrict resources to load only from certain domains, and disallow from any other domain. For example, you can write a CSP to restrict browsers to load images only from <code>example.com</code>, any images from other domains will be not loaded and would throw errors. In addition to resources, CSP also offers control over the embeds.<br>
In the following example, the CSP forces to load images/scripts only from self domain and prevents the loading of images from other domains.</p>

    </span></p>
<p><em>From the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/">W3c specification</a> docs:</em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the CSP goal is to mitigate the risk of content-injection attacks by giving developers fairly granular control over</p>
<ul>
<li>The resources which can be requested (and subsequently embedded or executed) on behalf of a specific Document or Worker</li>
<li>The execution of inline script</li>
<li>Dynamic code execution (via eval() and similar constructs)</li>
<li>The application of inline style</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>CSP can be implemented in following two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Specify in <strong>HTTP headers</strong> </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: __Policy__</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify in <strong>META tags</strong> </p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>meta</span> <span>http-equiv</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Content-Security-Policy<span>"</span></span> <span>content</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span> __Policy__ <span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Defining a policy</h4>
<p>The Policy is the accumulation of directives which defines the allowed location of each resource, no directive means allowed for all. Some of the useful directives are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>default-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all types of resources.</li>
<li><em>script-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all javascript, from where javascript can be loaded.</li>
<li><em>img-src</em> : This defines the loading policy for all images, from where images can be loaded. </li>
</ul>
<p>List of directives for the other resources is <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp#policy_applies_to_a_wide_variety_of_resources">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples of policies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow resources only from the same domain, and all other resources will fail to load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: img-src example.com;</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow images only from <code>example.com</code>, and all other images will fail to load.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src example.com;</code></pre></div>
<p>This would allow any resources to load only if from the same domain, except images which can be from <code>example.com</code> too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>CSP also provides a way to send violation reports, in case any logging is required, via <code>report-uri</code> directive. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.com/cspfails` </code></pre></div>
<p>The reports will be sent as POST request and with following JSON: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
 <span>"csp-report"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>"document-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com/"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"referrer"</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"blocked-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http://example.com/some_malware.js"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"violated-directive"</span><span>:</span> <span>"default-src self"</span><span>,</span>
   <span>"original-policy"</span><span>:</span> <span>"default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.com/cspfails"</span>
 <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<br>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>Before defining a CSP you should be completely aware of all the resources and respective origin required for your webapp, else some vital resources may be blocked and eventually random bugs.
In case you are not sure what all resources are being required for running your web page smoothly, you can implement the CSP in reporting mode, in this way the violations will be reported but no resource will be blocked, once you are sure what are the resources really required, you can implement CSP. To do this instead of <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> we need to use <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: __Policy__ + report-uri</code></pre></div>

  2020-10-31
</p>
<p>I recently released <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/release/0.8.3/">Oil 0.8.3</a>, and it's the biggest release in
recent memory!  What's new?</p>
<ul>
<li>Many changes to the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil expression language</a>, including
Python compatibility and legacy syntax removal.</li>
<li>Changes to the <strong>word</strong> syntax, e.g. the <code>@</code> sigil.</li>
<li>Keyword changes, like the removal of <code>pass</code>.</li>
<li>New <strong>functions</strong>, like <code>_match()</code> to access <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a> matches.</li>
<li>Enhancements to <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=shell-builtin#shell-builtin">shell builtins</a>, including <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>
support in <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>.</li>
<li>The comprehensive <code>errexit</code> overhaul, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html#reliable-error-handling">mentioned in the last
post</a>.</li>
<li>Many new docs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first of two posts that describe the language changes.  Separately,
I plan to write "the ultimate guide" to error handling in shell.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Oil, see the <strong>new</strong> <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/language-influences.html">Language
Influences</a> and  <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language
Idioms</a> docs, as well as posts tagged
#<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">oil-language</a>.</p>
 
<a name="help-wanted"></a>
<h2>Help Wanted</h2>
<p>If you're interested in Oil, now is a great time to get involved.  Recall that
the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/10/osh-features.html">last post</a> said that OSH would have four significant
fixes, but the rest of the project was too much work.  <strong>The work described
here is what I need help with</strong>!</p>
<p>Toward the end, I recently updated these pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil#important-we-accept-small-contributions">We Accept Small Contributions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Asking questions and leaving feedback about the language on
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zulip#zulip">Zulip</a> is also appreciated!  Several people have influenced the
language design this way.</p>
<a name="operators-expression-mode"></a>
<h2>Operators (Expression Mode)</h2>
<p>The expression language lets you talk about typed data with operators and
literals.  Let's review those changes first.</p>
<a name="return-to-python-compatibility"></a>
<h3>Return to Python Compatibility</h3>
<p>Last year, Oil had some "cleanups" of the Python expression language, but I
decided that the unfamiliarity isn't worth it.  I reverted them, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer division <code>div</code> is back to <code>//</code></li>
<li>Modulus <code>mod</code> is back to <code>%</code></li>
<li><code>xor</code> is back to <code>^</code></li>
<li>Exponentiation <code>^</code> is back to <code>**</code></li>
</ul>
<p>(The <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> has some rationale for this.)</p>
<a name="to-concatenate-and-to-match-globs"></a>
<h3><code>++</code> to concatenate, <code>~~</code> and <code>!~~</code> to match globs</h3>
<p>The <code>++</code> operator is for string and list concatenation.  That is, <code>a + b</code>
always does <strong>math</strong>, and <code>a ++ b</code> always does concatenation.</p>
<p>This is to support Awk-like auto-type conversion.  Similarly, comparison
operators like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> will only work on numbers, and we'll use a
different syntax for strings.  (Yes, I realize the danger with such type
conversion!)</p>
<p>The <code>~~</code> and <code>!~~</code> operators are for glob matching.  They deprecate <code>[[ x == *.py ]]</code> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.</p>
<a name="literals-expression-mode"></a>
<h2>Literals (Expression Mode)</h2>
<a name="dicts-are-not"></a>
<h3>Dicts are <code>{}</code>, not <code>%{}</code></h3>
<p>This is another return to Python compatibility.</p>
<p>We used sigils like <code>%{foo: 42}</code> in dict literals because Oil uses <code>{ }</code> for
C-like statement  blocks, and it lacks semicolons.</p>
<p>Making the tokens distinct is one way to avoid a subtle parsing issue.  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22706645">This
Hacker News comment</a> about the
Dart language describes some of the difficulties with using <code>{}</code>  in both
expressions and statements.</p>
<p>However, Oil's problem  is not as hard as Dart's, and I solved it by simply
including newlines in the grammar.  A key-value pair can be on a line:</p>
<pre><code>var mydict = {
  server: "www.example.com"  
  port: 80
}
</code></pre>
<p>But you can't split it across lines</p>
<pre><code>
var mydict = {
  server:
    "www.example.com"
}
</code></pre>
<p>without either <code>()</code> or <code>\</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var mydict = {
  
  server: (
    "www.example.com"
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>It was bugging me that lists are just <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, while dicts were <code>%{key: 'value'}</code>.  This is now fixed!</p>
<p>(<a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/121540-oil-discuss/topic/Expression.20Language.20Improvements/near/212235586">Good Zulip Feedback on Line
Breaking</a>.
I'm still looking for more feedback.)</p>
<hr>
<p>I also removed the <code>%[]</code> syntax , which was an overly ambitious idea for typed
array literals.  We already have <code>%(one two)</code> for shell-like arrays, and
<code>['one', 'two']</code> for Python/JS-like lists.</p>
<p>(Aside: Perl and Ruby have <code>qw(one two)</code> or <code>qw[one two]</code> which is like our
<code>%(one two)</code>.)</p>
<a name="blocks-are-echo-pwd"></a>
<h3>Blocks are <code>&amp;(echo $PWD)</code></h3>
<p>Oil's Ruby-like blocks are "first class".  Normally they're passed to procs as
the last argument:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp {
  echo $PWD
}
</code></pre>
<p>But we also need them in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/command-vs-expression-mode.html">expression
mode</a>.
I decided on the syntax <span><code>&amp;(echo $PWD)</code></span>.</p>
<p>This may seem inconsistent at first, but it's consistent with command subs:</p>
<pre><code>var b1 = $(echo $PWD)  
var b2 = &amp;(echo $PWD)  
</code></pre>
<a name="chars-are-u012345"></a>
<h3>Chars are <code>\u{012345}</code></h3>
<p>Character literals <strong>stand alone</strong> in the expression language, like</p>
<pre><code>var x = \u{3bf}  
</code></pre>
<p>That is, you don't need quotes.  They're for both "code point literals"
("runes" in Go) and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=eggex#eggex">eggex</a> char classes.</p>
<p>This syntax is now consistent within C-escaped strings like <code>$''</code> and <code>c''</code>,
and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>, which leads us into the next section.</p>
<a name="tightened-up-string-literals"></a>
<h2>Tightened Up String Literals</h2>
<p>Shell has a rich string literal syntax.  Oil inherits all of its power, but (as
of this release) removes unnecessary flexibility.</p>
<a name="c-style"></a>
<h3>C-Style</h3>
<p>Here are some C-style strings:</p>
<pre><code>echo $'C-style'
echo $'\n \i'               
echo $'\0123 \x01 \x1'      
echo $' \u1234 \U00012345'  
</code></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>\n</code> is a valid char escape, but <code>\i</code> is an <strong>invalid</strong> one.  Bash accepts
it and prints <code>\i</code> literally.</li>
<li>Octal escapes and hex escapes can express exactly the same bytes.</li>
<li>Hex escapes can be abbreviated <code>\x1</code> instead of <code>\x01</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I made the following changes to simplify this syntax:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disallow invalid char escapes.</li>
<li>Disallow <strong>all</strong> octal escapes.</li>
<li>Disallow single char hex escapes.  Must be <code>\xHH</code>.</li>
<li>Disallow the two unicode escapes in favor of the QSN/Rust style <code>\u{12345}</code>,
which I added support for.</li>
</ol>
<p>As usual, <strong>we do a dance to avoid breaking existing code</strong>, while preventing
legacy from creeping into the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In command mode, <code>shopt --unset parse_backslash</code> enables all these syntax
errors.  This is the default in <code>bin/oil</code> (option group <code>oil:all</code>).</li>
<li>In expression mode, they're always disallowed, even when running <code>bin/osh</code>.
Legacy shell scripts don't have expressions, so this is OK!</li>
</ul>
<a name="a-superset-of-qsn"></a>
<h3>A Superset of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <code>\u{12345}</code>, we have an interesting property: any <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>
string is now an Oil string!  Though you have to add a <code>$</code> sigil:</p>
<pre><code>echo $'QSN and Oil \\ \n'    

var mystr = $'\x01 \u{3bf}'  
var mystr = c'\x01 \u{3bf}'  
</code></pre>
<a name="double-quoted"></a>
<h3>Double Quoted</h3>
<p>Here are some doubled quoted strings:</p>
<pre><code>echo "double quoted"
echo "\$ \i"         
echo "\\ \ ."        
echo "\$ $ ."        
echo "old: `hostname`, new: $(hostname)"  
</code></pre>
<p>Oil makes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parse_backslash</code> makes <code>\i</code> and <code>\</code> a syntax error.  Add the
<code>\</code> to fix it.</li>
<li><code>parse_dollar</code> makes <code>$</code> a syntax error.  Ditto.</li>
<li><code>parse_backticks</code> makes the old command sub style a syntax
error.  Use the new style.</li>
</ul>
<p>These options are <strong>unset</strong> in the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/oil-options.html">option group</a>
<code>oil:all</code>.</p>
<p>Aside: our <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=lexing#lexing">lexing style</a> is awesome for making these
changes!</p>
<a name="word-syntax-command-mode"></a>
<h2>Word Syntax (Command Mode)</h2>
<p>I made similar changes to <strong>unquoted words</strong>.</p>
<a name="parse_at_all-reserves-words-beginning-with"></a>
<h3><code>parse_at_all</code> Reserves Words Beginning With <code>@</code></h3>
<p>In the <code>oil:basic</code> option group, we allow this syntax, but we only break the
bare minimum:</p>
<pre><code>echo @myarray
</code></pre>
<p>But the <code>oil:all</code> option group reserves <strong>any</strong> word beginning with <code>@</code>, like:</p>
<pre><code>@{} @[] @// @'' @""
</code></pre>
<p>This will be useful for future language extensions.  That is, creating more
syntax errors lets the language <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>
<p>I also expect <code>shopt --unset parse_dollar</code> to have this benefit.  It allows us
to parse inline eggexes like <code>$/ digit+ /</code>.</p>
<a name="parse_dollar-again-for-strictness"></a>
<h3><code>parse_dollar</code> Again, For Strictness</h3>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>No:</p>
<pre><code>echo $
echo "$"
</code></pre>
<p>Yes:</p>
<pre><code>echo \$
echo "\$"
</code></pre>
<p>TODO: We also need to support <code>strict_backslash</code> in unquoted words.</p>
<a name="next"></a>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>This post got long, so I split it into two parts.  The next part will review
changes in Oil keywords, stdlib functions, shell builtins, and documentations.</p>
<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jle86e/big_changes_to_the_oil_language/?">Let me know</a> what you think of these changes!</p>

<a name="appendix-the-tea-language"></a>
<h2>Appendix: The Tea Language</h2>
<p>One reason to be more Python compatible is that I have a quixotic plan to
self-host Oil and expose the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metalanguage#metalanguage">metalanguage</a> to users.  That is, our DSLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=opy#opy">OPy</a> / <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mypy#mypy">MyPy</a> subset</li>
<li>Zephyr <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zephyr-asdl#zephyr-asdl">ASDL</a></li>
<li>A dialect of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=regular-language#regular-language">regular languages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>should be combined into one language, which I'm calling "Tea".</p>
<p>Against my better judgement, I brought this up <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/jb5i5m/help_i_keep_stealing_features_from_elixir_because/g8urxou/">on
Reddit</a>
and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/4hx42h/assorted_thoughts_on_zig_rust#c_mqpg6e">on
lobste.rs</a>.
Briefly, Tea can be described as <strong>statically-typed Python with sum types</strong>
— which someone asked actually for!</p>
<p>And it should have <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=metaprogramming#metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> features to express the equivalent
of Oil's use of textual code generation.</p>
<p>I wrote a working grammar to design Tea's syntax (*), but that's the only
implementation so far.  It would be a large project, but it's also a concrete
one, because we have 30K-60K+ lines of working code as a use case.</p>
<p>If you want to work on a statically typed language, let me know!  I don't know
how to write a type checker, and can use help.</p>
<p>Even if Tea doesn't get done, Oil will be useful either way.  We can continue
using these DSLs for a long time.</p>
<hr>
<p>(*) The entire language is expressed in the grammar as a big expression, using
a single <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=lexer-modes#lexer-modes">lexer mode</a>.  It's nowhere near as complicated as
shell!</p>

<p><b>LIL</b> (stands for <b>L</b>ittle <b>I</b>nterpreted <b>L</b>anguage)
is a small highly dynamic scripting language inspired by Tcl and
unix shells. LIL has two implementations, one written in <b>C</b>,
which consists of a pair of <tt>.c</tt> and <tt>.h</tt> files
and one in <b><a href="http://freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a></b>,
which consists of a single <tt>pas</tt> file (a unit). Also a
<a href="http://lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus</a> package for the
latter is provided.</p>

<h2><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h2>

<p>LIL is currently available as source code snapshots of both
the C and the Free Pascal version combined in a single ZIP file.
These snapshots are versioned using their release date. Note that
the interpreter's reflect version command will report <i>0.1</i>
regardless of date versioning. Both of these will change at some
point in the future to provide proper versioned releases.</p>

<h3><a name="latestversion"></a>Latest version</h3>

<p>The latest version of LIL is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lil20190821.zip">lil20190821.zip</a>
(159KB). This is an extract from my private Fossil repository
(the files are mostly the same as the older archives, but this
also includes a full changelog from the repository going back
to 2010 and the LIL logo as an XCF image which can be opened with
GIMP).</p>

<p>Please note that <b>20190821</b> contains slightly altered
behavior for line breaking during list parsing that <i>could</i>
affect some scripts, especially with lists that contain code inside
square brackets, however the previous behavior was completely
broken (e.g. having multiple commands inside brackets in a list
would merge all commands into a single one and if a semicolon
was used for the multiple commands, the entire command wouldn't
be parsed properly). Because of that i expect any reliance on
the previous behavior to be accidental (and in practice i do not
really expect any such script to even exist). Also in the same
version a Bash script is introduced to check the differences between
different executables by running the same scripts under both and
comparing the results, which show that FPLIL contains a few incompatibilities
with C LIL. At this moment FPLIL doesn't implement the changes
mentioned so far - all these incompatibilities and changes will
be fixed in a later release.</p>

<h3><a name="olderversions"></a>Older versions</h3>

<p>Some older versions are also available in case you need them.
LIL should be mostly backwards compatible (see below), but right
now there is no promise for strict API or ABI compatibility.</p>

<h3><a name="winlil"></a>WinLIL</h3>

<p>If you are using Windows you can also download <b>WinLIL</b>,
a small Windows-based environment with editor, console and extra
graphics functions that can be used to experiment with LIL. It
is self-contained in a single executable, including the LIL documentation.</p>

<p>The latest version is <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil14.zip">WinLIL 1.4</a>
(204KB) based on <i>C LIL 20190821</i>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil.png">Here
is a screenshot</a> of it in action. Also a small doodle program
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.lil">downloaded here</a> and a <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/doodle.gif">screenshot
seen here</a>. <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190821231511.zip">This archive</a>
(45KB) contains the source code, but note that it uses the original
Borland C++ Builder and to compile with a newer version (such
as the free Community Edition) you'll need to recreate the project
file and make a few modifications to the code.</p>

<p>Older versions of WinLIL can be found in these files: <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil13.zip">winlil13.zip</a>
(1.3 binary), <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/winlil20190524200539.zip">winlil20190524200539.zip</a>

(source).</p>

<h3><a name="lilgui"></a>LILGUI</h3>

<p><b>LILGUI</b> is an experimental API specification for GUI
applications that provide scripting functionality through LIL
to expose a simple GUI API. It is mainly intended for creating
embeddable GUIs (e.g. a panel in a sidebar) although it can also
be used for popup windows and dialogs. Currently the only implementation
for LILGUI is <b>LazLILGUI</b>, which is a component for Lazarus
that uses LCL to provide the actual GUI functionality.</p>

<p>The latest version of LILGUI files (which include the API spec,
LazLILGUI and a couple of examples) can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/lilgui20190708215135.zip">downloaded
here</a> (85KB). A 64bit windows binary for <b>LazLILGUI Notepad</b>,
a text editor that provides a sidebar to try out LILGUI code,
can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepad20190708.zip">downloaded here</a> (1.3MB).
Also you can see the screenshots of program in action under <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadwin.png">Windows</a>, <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadlin.png">Linux</a>
and <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgnotepadosx.png">Mac OS X</a> and also the <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgcce.png">Custom Control Example</a> under Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>API stability and compatibility</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, both the C and Free Pascal implementation
APIs are stable <i>for the most part</i>. The <b>C API</b> was
broken only once in middle 2010 when <code>lil_command_t</code>
was renamed to <code>lil_func_t</code> and the <b>C ABI</b> for
the Windows DLL is also backwards compatible since late 2010.
The <b>Free Pascal</b> implementation has a less stable API but
as Free Pascal itself does not support ABI stability, this is
less of a concern.</p>

<p>In the foreseeable future the C API should be stable, but i'd
recommend <i>against</i> building a system-wide shared version
of the library before a proper versioned release is made. Once
a versioned release is made, both the API and ABI will remain
stable for as long as it is technically possible.</p>

<p>Script code should be backwards compatible even as new commands
are introduced since scripts and host applications will redefine
any conflicting functions anyway. The only time script code was
broken was in 2012 when the multiline comments were introduced
so any script that used a comment line like <code>#####</code>
was broken. This was addressed in a fix in 2014 that added a special
check for such cases so that multiline comments can only start
and end with two <code>#</code>s but not three or more (while
this could have broken any script that used three or more <code>#</code>s
to start and end multiline comments, the chances for such a script
are very slim).</p>

<p>Like with the C API, the script backwards compatibility currently
is mostly stable, but minor changes (like the multiline comment
changes mentioned above) might be made until a versioned release
is made or fixes to the script behavior to be closer to what is
described in the documentation or simply fix broken behavior.
At that point no changes will be made that may affect backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>LILGUI and LazLILGUI are more experimental and may see backwards
incompatible changes in the future.</p>

<h2><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Currently the only documentation is the (lengthy) <tt>readme.txt</tt>
file that <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/readme.txt">you can read here</a> or as part
of the archive containing the source code. At some point i'll
write better formatted documentation. Free Pascal has its own
API documentation <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/pasreadme.txt">readable here</a> and
also as a part of the archive containing the source code.</p>

<p>The LILGUI API can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/api.txt">found here</a> and
the documentation for LazLILGUI can be <a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/llgreadme.txt">found
here</a>. Both are also part of the LILGUI archive.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/badsectoracula/lil-presentation">an
old LIL presentation can be found on SlideShare</a>. Please note
that the URLs in the presentation are not valid anymore.</p>

<h2><a name="status"></a>Status</h2>

<p>LIL is practically <i>feature-complete</i> and i do very little
development of it. I do not plan on making it a big and bloated
library that tries to provide everything - if anything, in the
future i might add some conditionals to remove bits of the library
for users who do not need, e.g, the string or list functions.</p>

<p>Further work is mostly "around" LIL and not on the
language itself: improving the documentation, writing a test suite
(currently there are several examples which i run after making
changes and almost half of them come from bug fixes, but i'd like
somethnig more automated), fixing some issues with the Free Pascal
implementation, adding more functions on the C API to access LIL's
state, etc.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About every year or so I decide to change note-taking apps. Or at least I change <em>most</em> of my notes to a new app. This time I'm going back to an old app, but because of a "new" note-taking paradigm. The one I'm going back to is <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, but with a twist. In this post, I hope to look at some of the new ideas in note-taking and some of the apps available.</p><p>The new paradigm that I'm talking about is backlinking. It's actually not a new idea at all of course, but there have been many apps that have started to take advantage of backlinking. The one that launched off the fad was <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. Many of these tools are based on or enable, a note-taking method called Zettelkasten.</p><p>Zettelkasten is a technique of note taking and indexing popularized by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist from the middle of the 20th century. Zettelkasten, literally "slip box", was a note-taking method in which small slips of paper were ID'd and linked to one another, creating a linked system of knowledge that Luhmann could then use in his books, research, and papers. As the links were maintained in two directions, ideas could be backward linked to other ideas. Ideas from various sources could then form a new network and hopefully, new links could be formed between information. There's more to it, such as the idea that each note should be an atomic, well-formed idea. For more information, and because I'm failing to explain it, visit <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">https://zettelkasten.de/</a>.</p><p>I won't pretend to be an expert in Zettelkasten, and all of this is new to me. Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Zettelkasten method would be useful to me as I need longer form notes on many of the things that I do. But the idea of backlinking notes so that you can refer to notes that refer to the note that you're on seems extremely powerful. It feels like the next innovation in note-taking, beyond simple outlining or linking, precisely because you're essentially forming a distributed network of notes.</p><h2>Backlinks</h2><p>Let me give you an example. Say that I'm working on Kubernetes and can't remember the name of a tool that I had used. I can just pull up the Kubernetes note and look at the backlinks and see which notes are tagged as Kubernetes. Why couldn't I just create a link on the Kubernetes note? Well, of course, I could, but that would require opening that note and adding a link that may have nothing to do with the context for the primary Kubernetes notes.</p><p>Or another example, I am taking notes on a sermon being preached on John 3. I can then dive into John 3's note and look at all other sources tagged with John 3, including sermon notes, book notes, or personal devotional notes. From there I could dive into individual topics such as love or the kingdom of God.</p><p>At least, that's how I hope it will work in practice. Again, I'm just getting started</p><p>It seems that with the release of Roam Research, there have now been a plethora of tools in development that work off of the idea of backlinks, as well as atomic thoughts. I've done a lot of research in the last week, and have formed some opinions about some. Let's start first with the note-taking app I'm coming from:</p><h2>Notion</h2><p><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> seemed to take off in 2018-2019 as the premiere note-taking app. Indeed, Notion has introduced backlinks in a recent release.</p><p>I like Notion, and will both keep paying for it and taking notes there. It has a lot of power in organizing and reorganizing notes, as well as pulling in other content such as code, videos, images, etc. It even goes so far as to include database-like tables and Kanban-style boards.</p><p>Backlinks in Notion seem to primarily work at the "page" level, rather than the block//heading level like Roam Research. And while I love Notion as a clean interface for notes, I'm not wild about its lack of capabilities in making TODOs and alerts and finding notes after the fact. Its search is great but basic.</p><h2>Roam Research</h2><p><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> seems like a really powerful system, particularly for a research-style Zettelkasten. I honestly have not tried it, both because I didn't get into the trial, but now because of the cost and the concern of people losing notes and the lack of good backups. Most of the posts I've seen about note stability have disappeared, but you can see one graveyard here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/">https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/hsrg0z/lost_all_my_notes_need_recommendations_for/</a>. There was even a post today about it: <a href="https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/">https://jeffchen.dev/posts/Recovering-Lost-Roam-Notes/</a></p><p>Frankly, I prefer open source and being in control of my own content and notes. I know Notion doesn't fit into that well, but it also seemed ahead of its time to me.</p><h2>TiddlyWiki</h2><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> has been around a while and was the note system I used before Notion. TiddlyWiki is many things, but at its heart, it was a single file HTML that you could download and make changes to in wiki syntax. TiddlyWiki has had backlinks for a while, possibly even before Roam Research, but recently the community has released some versions specifically for backlinking: <a href="https://akhater.github.io/drift/">Drift</a> and <a href="https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch/">Tiddly Research</a> are two that I've tried out.</p><p>They're great, but there are a few problems that I've had with TiddlyWiki that just make me hesitant. I had a lot of notes in it as I was working in Seminary, wrote a custom Bible linking plugin, etc, but updating it was a nightmare on the node version with my customization. For each upgrade, I'd have to manually diff my plugin changes against the upgrades. Of course, this may have just been me not knowing what I was doing, but it still wasn't fun. Also, just the speed of entering notes and using the mouse doesn't appeal to me. Being a Vim guy, I like my keyboard.</p><h2>Obsidian</h2><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a recent and gorgeous option for note-taking. It was actually my first introduction to backlinking and this whole area of decentralized notes. It's a commercial-style app (more on that below), but also works off of just a directory of markdown files. So you get to keep your content regardless. It feels great to use, I like its editor (not as well as <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> or Notion though), and it's fast, responsive, and the keyboard shortcuts are great. It even has a basic Vim mode.</p><p>My only hangups are: if you use it for commercial purposes, the license becomes a pay-as-you-go SAAS license. The free license is just for personal use. Also, it's not open source, so there's always the risk that the company could go under and disappear, or worse, that they start charging way after I'm invested in it. Sure, they're just markdown files...I could make my own note-taking app if that were the case...but I don't have that much time or interest. Also, the backlinks seem to just be at the note level, but I didn't mind that as much in this app.</p><p>Still, if you're looking for a personal note-taking app that's easy to get into, supports backlinks, has the graph, uses markdown, is modern-looking, and is nice to use, totally give Obsidian a try.</p><h2>Joplin</h2><p><a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> is one that I've just tried a little bit. It looks fine as far as an editor, has nice backlinking, etc. The one hangup that made me put it down quickly is that links are always based on note ID, so you have to find a note to get its ID and insert it. It didn't seem nearly as fast or practical as I wanted. It is open source though, and worth a look.</p><h2>Trilium</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium</a> is an app I see recommended often. It's also free and open source. It claims to have automatic markdown conversion, but I couldn't get it to work. I gave up pretty soon after that.</p><h2>Zim</h2><p><a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a> is a desktop wiki that I've used quite a lot in the past. It also has a backlinks plugin. It works great, is open source as well, and is very quick for taking notes. The negatives for this one are that it looks old and that it uses a custom wiki syntax that I don't like as well as markdown or Org.</p><h2>MindForger</h2><p><a href="https://www.mindforger.com/">MindForger</a> kind of does its own thing. It's difficult to explain, but worth checking out. It kind of has backlinks in that it has notes that are related to each other, but in more of an AI/intuitive way than in a manual way. It takes the headlines of Markdown files and makes them notes, but for each note lets you embed other top headlines/etc. It's weird but worth checking out. For a great intro, watch the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlW2e1X3O-I</a>.</p><p>MindForger is open source and seems really powerful. I'm going to keep playing with it. The only negative is that it's got the whole split-screen preview/markdown editor like many of the others on this list, but there's no graphical component to the editor at all. The keyboard shortcuts are multi-key and not configurable as well, but they're intuitive.</p><h2>Foam</h2><p><a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a> is a plugin to Visual Studio code that emulates many features from Roam/Obsidian. It has backlinks, a graph, and looks decent.</p><p>Honestly, though, I don't like Visual Studio code, it's not the greatest editing experience, and the backlinks seem majorly delayed from saving. But maybe that was just my experience. This is one that has a lot of promise and I would keep my eye on in the future, but seems it has a little ways to go.</p><p>I'll give an honorable mention to <a href="https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron">Dendron</a>, which seems to be at least on par with Foam. It also has a hierarchical system but seems to keep all of the files in the same directory using a dot-separated notation. Also worth checking out and watching, but also had delayed backlink processing and note a great markdown editing experience.</p><h2>Org-roam</h2><p><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a> is where I landed for now. Org-roam is an extension of the famous <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> for Emacs. I used Org Mode a LOT when I was new to Emacs. It's really crazy how deep the rabbit hole goes for Org Mode. Org Mode is best described as an outliner, journal, day planner, calendar, TODO list, kanban board, interactive coding tool, TODO capture tool (including linking to source code lines, a browser, or even against a pdf as you're reading it), and presentation software. I'm sure there are a dozen or two things I'm missing too.</p><p>I'll caveat this though...you have to be a little crazy to use org-mode. Configuring it alone can be a trial in insanity, but once you master …</p></div></div>

But what does it take to secure one of these highly sought-after positions? Like any job in technology, machine learning positions require candidates to go through a rigorous series of technical interviews. </p><p id="viewer-43gc5">What is the structure of these interviews? What topics are covered? Are these interviews similar to software engineering? (Spoiler: sorta, kinda) Who is paying for lunch? </p><p id="viewer-781mt">There are a lot of questions, but not a lot of answers out there. This is largely because the field of machine learning is still young and learning to stand on its own two feet. </p><p id="viewer-cemkd">This article is intended to be the missing guide for what to expect in a machine learning interview. The observations in this post are born out of collective experiences interviewing for machine learning engineer and scientist positions, comprising over 90 hours of interview time across 80+ interviews at big (FAANG) companies, small (just out of Y-Combinator) companies, and everything in-between.</p><p id="viewer-522i9">Let's get started.</p><h3 id="viewer-32gml"><strong>Machine learning interviews are diverse...sometimes</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ecirs">The machine learning landscape is constantly evolving. If you were entering the world of machine learning ~4 years ago, the most in-demand skill would be the ability to build and debug deep learning models. Today with the rise of tools like PyTorch and Tensorflow, a bigger issue is not so much how to build machine learning prototypes but rather how to take them all the way to a deployed system in production (also called the last-mile problem). </p><p id="viewer-63ac7">What this means is that over the course of several years of interviewing for these positions, we've learned that the nature of these assessments can be incredibly diverse. For example, the following are examples of real interview types/questions that we've had:</p><p id="viewer-ac86k">	1) Read a recent paper on unsupervised learning for noise reduction and whiteboard extensions to the techniques proposed in the paper</p><p id="viewer-aj8c3">	2) Explain the nodes in the Tensorflow computational graph for a feedforward layer of a neural network</p><p id="viewer-5lue8">	3) Give an hour-long talk about some machine learning project you have done and get grilled on its details</p><p id="viewer-4bjvl">	4)  Describe how you would implement Google's autocomplete </p><p id="viewer-2p8og">	5) Explain why L1 regularization encourages sparsity in features</p><p id="viewer-5hjhh">Sound like these questions are all over the place? Don't get overwhelmed: they are.</p><p id="viewer-53d1i">Does that mean you will have to know how to do all of the above for your interview? No, definitely not. This variety is only meant to illustrate that many things are fair game depending on the company you are applying to and what they expect your responsibilities will be. </p><p id="viewer-3hihv">For example, if you are applying to a more research-intensive machine learning position, you may be asked to explain research-caliber work (either yours or that of others). Or if you are going to be a machine learning engineer at a young company, you may have to be more familiar with the internals of a framework or technology stack that is in high-demand. It really depends.</p><p id="viewer-7annu">That being said, as the field has matured, we've seen that the responsibilities of these positions are getting more well-defined leading to more standardized assessment structures.</p><p id="viewer-ciu37">Nowadays for most machine learning engineer positions, you can expect your interview journey to look something like the following:</p><ul><li id="viewer-6irq6"><p>First screening call with a recruiter</p></li><li id="viewer-edt1j"><p>Technical phone interview covering some software engineering and machine learning theory</p></li><li id="viewer-e1103"><p>Onsite (~4-5 interviews)</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-esrfv">                - Software engineering principles (~2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-62fec">                - Machine learning theory (~1 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-2ugbd">                - Machine learning system design (~1-2 interviews)</p><p id="viewer-es0je">                - Interview with management (cultural fit check, typical in startups)</p><p id="viewer-73jhi">This can be subject to change depending on the company, but we've largely seen that common format across interviews today. Now let's discuss what to expect in terms of specific skills being evaluated.</p><h3 id="viewer-avlia"><strong>Know your machine learning theory</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dob3m">When applying for machine learning jobs you will always be asked about machine learning theory. In a sense, this a "well duh" moment but the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>machine learning</u></a> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>theory</u></a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>literature</u></a> is vast so knowing what to focus on rather than working through multiple 1000-page textbooks is the key question.</p><p id="viewer-et0di"> Conceptual questions are asked in one of two forms: 1) in the context of some larger problem (i.e. while describing a system design, discuss model tradeoffs) or 2) in isolation (i.e. spend 30+ minutes describing how your favorite supervised learning algorithm works).</p><p id="viewer-t28k">In either case, the types of questions and concepts you'll be asked about stay pretty consistent. Our survey of past machine learning interviews has shown that you will tend to be tested on topics such as the following:</p><p id="viewer-5srhm">	1) What is the bias-variance tradeoff?</p><p id="viewer-fo0au">	2) What is overfitting/underfitting and how do you know when your model is suffering from those issues?</p><p id="viewer-bg784">	3) How do you evaluate model performance (which metrics are used and why)?</p><p id="viewer-b17gt">	4) Can you explain how some classical machine learning models work (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, etc.)?</p><p id="viewer-2o3la">	5) What are common techniques for unsupervised learning?</p><p id="viewer-3sb7r">	6) How do you pick the best features for your model?</p><p id="viewer-b7b5m">That being said, because the collection of potential theory topics is so large, we've distilled the key concepts seen in interviews into a <a href="https://www.confetti.ai/assets/ml-primer/ml_primer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>primer with practice exercises</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-537k4"><strong>Software engineering is still important</strong></h3><p id="viewer-8v5gq">While the focus of machine learning jobs isn't just software engineering, you should still expect to be asked some more traditional coding and algorithms questions. These questions will be very similar, if not identical, to those you would be asked in a standard engineering interview. </p><p id="viewer-27v4b">Although this may seem unrelated to what you would think a machine learning practitioner does, when you are on the job knowing <em>how</em> to theoretically build a model is not the same as doing the actual building. This is true whether or not you are applying to be a machine learning scientist or a machine learning engineer. You need to be proficient in coding, debugging, and thinking through algorithms exercises. As an example of topics you can expect to be asked about:</p><p id="viewer-eal72">	1) Recursion and memoization (you'll basically never use recursion in the real world but 		   it's often used to evaluate your ability to think through an algorithm)</p><p id="viewer-cmind">	2) Memory and run-time complexity analysis</p><p id="viewer-d4m4q">	3) Standard data structures like trees, linked lists, hash maps, and general graphs</p><p id="viewer-9rse9">That being said, the standards for coding may not be the same in your interviews as they would be of someone applying for a pure software development position. In other words your engineering abilities might not need to be as sophisticated, especially if you are just coming out of an advanced graduate degree program in machine learning where your focus was more on pushing state-of-the-art rather than building robust training pipelines. </p><p id="viewer-dkeon">For software engineering, there are a number of popular <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>books</u></a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>services</u></a> that can help you practice these skills.</p><h3 id="viewer-76m1h"><strong>Know how to build machine learning systems</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ba220">Knowing how to architect machine learning systems is one of the most important skills you can have going into the field of machine learning. One of the big aspects of machine learning's evolution in the past 1-2 years is that companies are going all-in on integrating data-driven solutions to extract business value across their teams. At scale this can lead to <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/150-successful-machine-learning-models-6-lessons-learned-at-booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>tremendous improvements</u></a> in the quality of a service. </p><p id="viewer-2j318">When you are being brought into a team as a machine learning expert, the expectation is that you will be able to apply machine learning skills to improve some existing manual process. Oftentimes you will be presented with very vague problem descriptions (e.g. "I want these recommendations to be better") and you will have to break down and frame the problem in a form where machine learning is applicable.</p><p id="viewer-bj4et">This is the core of designing and architecting machine learning systems. This skill is among the most crucial ones that companies look for when evaluating candidates. A system design interview will involve being presented with a case study (e.g. "we want a tool that can help us detect offensive content on our platform") and then talking through how to set up a machine learning pipeline that can address the problem. Along the way you will be assessed on your ability to:</p><p id="viewer-b3dv8">	1) Gather and validate datasets needed for your models</p><p id="viewer-3ctv5">	2) Build training infrastructure</p><p id="viewer-actbm">	3) Discuss the tradeoffs among potential modelling solutions</p><p id="viewer-7bofr">	4) Know what metrics you will track for model performance</p><p id="viewer-5tid6">	5) Interpret model predictions and do error analysis</p><p id="viewer-b2nej">	6) Architect a deployment solution (e.g. cloud-based, on-device, etc.)</p><p id="viewer-3hr9b">	7) Iterate on user feedback to improve the solution</p><p id="viewer-2fn8e">The important thing to recognize in these types of interviews is that there is never one "correct" answer. Your interviewers are more interested in knowing how you think through a problem. You will be asked to justify your decisions and also adapt them based on new situations (e.g. "now imagine we don't have enough money to gather 1 million annotated images...").</p><p id="viewer-2plnr">When preparing for these types of interviews, there's no substitute for real-world experience. Build projects so you witness firsthand what tradeoffs are necessary to consider. If that's not possible, spend a lot of time reading through company use-cases and learning how others have <a href="https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>solved similar problems</u></a>. </p><h3 id="viewer-44oq9"><strong>Technical interviews are just one signal</strong></h3><p id="viewer-dmrea">The last point worth mentioning is that while technical interviews are important signals in determining whether you get the job, they are still only one of many contributing signals. In particular, many startups also place great emphasis on your cultural fit …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

Why not a text adventure!"</p><p>Now, it turns out that the way I implemented this game, I don't need the 4.1 features. I'll probably add that in the future to support more dynamic command parsing.</p><p>If you have <code>vscode</code>, you can play now with a quick <code>npm install</code> into any node project. (See below for full installation instructions.)</p><h3>So What?</h3><p>This is a level 99 typescript wizardry demo. </p><p>If you aren't a typescript nerd, you might miss the significance of this, but here is the basic idea:</p><p>First of all, everything you see here is running in the vscode code editor (without any program running). In fact, you can't even run my code. If you compile it to javascript, this is what you will get:</p><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> gameStart = <span>null</span>;</code></pre></div></div></div><p><span>➖</span></p><p><span>➕</span></p></div><p>(There might be a little more debris then that, but you get the idea.)</p><p>This screenshot should make it clear that the typescript type system is doing all the work:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-04-type-only.png"></span></p><p>However, it's not very convenient to declare all those StepNN types, so I made a fluent mode that reduces the need for those:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-01.png"></span></p><p>There is also an easy mode that uses only an object tree. It was very easy to make, but autocomplete ruins the fun by giving all the answers away. </p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-05-easy.png"></span></p><p>In the process of making the game, I discoved that vscode supports jsdoc markdown. So I decided to use that for the game output since it is so rich. It even supports images:</p><p><span><img src="https://ricklove.me/blog-content/posts/2020-10-24-typescript-type-system-adventure/game-screenshot-03.png"></span></p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>Play in vscode using autocomplete and tooltips</li><li>Game output displayed in tooltips using jsdoc3 with markdown (including gifs)</li><li>Implemented using conditional types, string literals, and a minimal state machine</li></ul><h3>How to play</h3><ul><li><code>npm i @ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure</code></li><li>Create a new <code>play.ts</code> file and add the below code</li><li>Hover over <code>execute</code> to see game output (see screenshots for examples)</li></ul><div><div><div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> { gameStart } <span>from</span> <span>'@ricklove/typescript-type-system-adventure'</span>;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="article">
<p>Today is a big day for me as after many months (or years depending how you look at it), I've <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brandvantage">finally launched the first product for my business, BrandVantage</a>.
This post is the story of how I started with one idea and ended up launching with a different one.</p>
<h2>The Original Idea: Let's build a digital brand expert!</h2>
<p>I worked as a web developer for a local web development agency for a number of years and in that time, I learnt a lot about how a variety of different businesses operated online.</p>
<p>There were a few key "problems" I found in common across many of those businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under-utilising analytics</li>
<li>Misunderstanding analytics</li>
<li>Not keeping on top of industry information</li>
<li>Lack of competitor analysis/understanding</li>
<li>Difficulty with Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
</ul>
<p>In moderate-to-large companies where you have marketing departments, most of this stuff can be covered by one or more staff dedicated to these things.
In smaller companies, the business owner is normally the one where these tasks fall on to, but they are already wearing many different hats.
It felt like something was here - if I could automate some of these tasks in different ways, I could both help business owners and earn myself some money along the way.</p>
<p>Automation of tasks, especially ones in analytics or SEO spaces, isn't a new idea.
In fact, I've seen many businesses in a similar space launch on Product Hunt over the years since starting, but that didn't deter me.
I was building <a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+better+mousetrap"><em>a better mousetrap</em></a> and wanting to launch it at a lower price, not something truly innovative so it was going to be an uphill battle.
This area though, helping small businesses online be as efficient in tasks as some bigger businesses can, is something I felt passionately about so I proceeded anyway.</p>
<h3>Attempt One: Very Hacky (in PHP)</h3>
<p>Way back in 2015/16/17, while still at my full-time job, I spent nights and weekends building and tinkering on solutions to the problems business owners face.
It was a hacky PHP solution pulling real-time information from sources like Twitter, Google Analytics and Facebook.
A hacky approach seemed like a good idea as that seemed to be the way people launched things, do the quickest and hackiest thing you can to get it out the door.</p>
<p>While working on it, I had a few interested parties though what I built could barely be considered a prototype.
The thing was a mess.
I could do some basic queries, but it wasn't what I considered sellable and definitely not user-friendly, something I considered key to the product.
I was also running into technical problems with scale - any sufficiently complex query was performed real-time, which was getting more complicated.
Real-time processing had to be out.
I needed to pre-compute and store it in a database.</p>
<p>I wanted to take this more seriously and I didn't feel like a "quick and hacky" approach to building a product was right for me.
With this in mind, it seemed like a good opportunity to change the tech stack to something that would be better long term.</p>
<h3>Attempt Two: Slightly Less Hacky (in .NET)</h3>
<p>Moving to .NET felt like the smart move for me as at my job I had spent a lot more time working in .NET than PHP, plus I vastly prefered the tooling in .NET vs PHP.
That said, the .NET code I had worked on to-date would definitely be considered "legacy code".</p>
<p>My first version in .NET (specifically .NET Framework), predating my use of version control, was trying to keep costs low by using MySQL through Entity Framework.
After a lot of pain and suffering with that, I had a short stint of MSSQL before I settled upon MongoDB.</p>
<p>MongoDB might seem like a weird choice - there are some people that have very strong opinions about which type of database you should use.
Honestly it came down to a gut feel after messing around with it - it seemed more compatible to the way I was approaching problems than a relational database would.
I liked the code-first approach to Entity Framework so much though that I recreated the "feel" of Entity Framework for MongoDB with some custom code.
This later became an open source project of mine called <a href="https://www.mongoframework.com/">MongoFramework</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to lie, progress was... slow.
While I was putting quite a lot of time into working on it, it was still an extremely ambitious project.
I have strong feelings about building "MVPs" where some people focus too much on the "minimum" without enough focus on the "viable".
At the end of the day people buy products that meet their needs, and cutting too much out would meet no-ones needs.
If someone was going to use this, in a market with many competitors of varying quality, it had to do its job well.
There didn't seem much I could reasonably cut to make it any more minimal if I wanted people to buy it.</p>
<p>I kept working at it every night, building pieces to extract and store data from a variety of sources.
I was pulling in data from Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools (now called Google Search Console), Twitter, Facebook, IP Geolocation, DNS information and also from news articles.
What I thought I could do is once I had the different data sources together, I would write custom rules that could infer insights from individual or combined data sets.
These insights would form the basis of the "digital brand expert".
After all, that was the goal of the idea, something that could help out small business owners.</p>
<p>After 2 years of working on this in my spare time, it felt the right time to leave my job and go into this full time.
I felt like I was <em>so close</em> to launching and I just needed something more than the same day-to-day work.
So I did it - <a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/i-left-my-job-today-after-seven-years">I left my job after 7 years</a>.</p>
<h3>Going Full-time into the Idea</h3>
<p>Right out of the gate, I had moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core, was working on UI/UX improvements for the application and launched the website for it.
I worked with an accountant and a lawyer to setup the business, bought a trade mark for the product name, and I felt good like I was only a few months away from launching.
This feeling didn't last though...</p>
<p>Over time, it felt like I was taking two steps forward then one step back - some technical, some business related.
Sure, that is still progress, but having new issues crop up every day or so can really crush your motivation.</p>
<p>My best/happiest/most productive days were days I ignored or avoided different issues I had.
If I had a problem with the login system, I would focus on how the UX of the menus worked.
If I had a problem with data gathering, I would add more tests to the codebase.
While I didn't entirely ignore the problem, I would wait a week or two before I looked at it again, somewhat hoping it would solve itself - unfortunately that isn't how things work.</p>
<p>In time though, I got to a stage where it felt like I could launch and was hyping myself up until reality struck: I didn't actually build what I set out to build.</p>
<p>The UI/UX was good, I had strategies for deployment and plans for next steps, but it wasn't a "digital brand expert".
It was instead a glorified data store for information that people could better access through existing tools.
That's kinda a big problem!</p>
<p><img src="https://turnerj.com/blog/2020/images/a-better-mousetrap-ive-made-a-huge-mistake.gif" alt="Gob Bluth saying &quot;I've made a huge mistake.&quot; from the TV Show &quot;Arrested Development&quot;"></p>
<p>When realising this I poured time into fixing that huge lapse in judgement, but I couldn't do it.
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't figure out how to build this rules engine.
It was like my entire thought process was just clouded.
I couldn't see the solution to the problem like I can for most other things.</p>
<p>This was depressing and I ended up having a month or so hiatus from working on it.
When I have had stints of not feeling like or not being able to do programming in the past, I try and spur it on again by watching some show or movie which has some strong relation to technology (fictional or not).
My go-to is usually something like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Iron Man</a>, but this time I was rewatching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a> where I found some inspiration.</p>
<h2>The Pivot: An API to the Internet</h2>
<p>Later in the series a lot of the focus is around the Web, and it was in these episodes where my thoughts about the Internet and the data on it have changed.
There is a quote from one of the main characters at the end of Season 3 that resonates with me:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"The moment we decide what the Web is, we've lost. The moment we try to tell people what to do with it, we've lost.
All we have to do is build a door and let them inside."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 3, Episode 10)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Internet is a treasure trove of information, it is searchable but generally unstructured.
People have managed to create all sorts of different pages in HTML, but in the process of making a website everything is designed for a human user.
It is this way for obvious reasons, <em>we</em> are the consumers of web pages after all... aren't we?</p>
<p>Behind these user-friendly web pages are usually other specific bits of markup, providing some level of structured data for specific situations.
Sometimes it is a description metatag for search engines, other times it might be <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metatags for social media links.
We build these things to help aid computers processing our web pages.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> was created.
This was a collaborative effort between Google, Bing and Yahoo (later that year, Yandex as well) with the mission to "create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond".
Through 3 different encodings (<a href="https://turnerj.com/blog/what-is-microdata-and-why-should-i-care">Microdata</a>, <a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>), websites could express detailed structured data.</p>
<p>There is another quote from Halt and Catch Fire which I like:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Computers aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets us to the thing."</p>
<p>- Joe MacMillan (Season 1, Episode 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As much as I like computers and programming, they are used to help us achieve other goals.
From my attempts of trying to build a "digital brand expert", I knew that data is fundamental to help build more advanced systems and give new insights.
Having easier access to other forms of data from web pages around the world may allow new and different tools to be built.</p>
<p>So I decided rather than try and solve a problem that I was clouded by, I …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last few years have seen rapid automation of many Systems Administration/DevOps tasks. The new mantra is if you need to ssh to a server, your automation is not working right. But even for the occasional ssh access to the servers, the SSH authentication must be managed. Over the years, SSH has added many new features/techniques to enhance authentication and put some governance around it. This article is about the use of SSH Certificate-based authentication and why every organization, using SSH, must use it.</p><p>SSH Key-based authentication (aka passwordless login) has been with us for over two decades now. The mechanism works based on public-key cryptography. One adds his/her RSA/DSA key to the authorized_keys file on the server. The user with the corresponding private key can login without a password. It works great except for a few fundamental problems:</p><ol><li>When a user accesses the server using ssh for the first time, s/he always gets Trust On First Use (TOFU) warning.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh -l alice mavrix5.dbsentry.com
The authenticity of host 'mavrix5.dbsentry.com (72.191.40.116)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:PoK81UWgOBMn6owOoHXjGoBLWqcJ4E9JCiLQyiFF60s.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
</code></pre><p>As the server is not trusted at this point, theoretically a man-in-the-middle attack could be launched. I tried to find damaging incidents of such attacks on the internet but could not find any. Nevertheless, the possibility exists and we’d be better off getting rid of this warning.</p><ol start="2"><li>When the number of servers increases, authorized_keys files proliferate and they are hard to manage. Moreover, once added they are active perpetually and have to be removed manually to block access to its corresponding private key. That is probably the reason why many security guys frown on the use of authorized_keys.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, the newer version of SSH included many improvements that give us the ability to centralize and better manage authorized_keys using <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code>. However, the TOFU remains. Although the solutions exist in either the use of SSHFP or SSH Certificates, their usage never caught on.</p><p>Having said that, in addition to taking care of TOFU, SSH Certificates have many more advantages/features (for e.g. certificate expiration, use of principals, etc) that enhance SSH authentication governance and should be used by all organizations that use SSH.</p><p>Instead of using complex X.509 style certificates, SSH chose to use their own simpler format of certificates, which can be easily managed using CLI <code>ssh-keygen</code>. In order to use SSH certificate-based authentication one needs to set up SSH Certificate Authority (CA). So, how does one set up SSH CA?</p><p>SSH Certificate authority can be setup on any computer with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. It is a key pair that is used to sign SSH Public Keys to generate certificates. It is recommended to set up two pairs of CA keys: one for host certificates and others for user’s certificates.</p><p>Use <code>ssh-keygen</code> to genearet CA Keys:</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_user_key
</code></pre><p>The above would generate two pairs of SSH Keys. for e.g.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ca_host_key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in ca_host_key.
Your public key has been saved in ca_host_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Epoq1Vy0/orivKOwxepBLqD7mGuaWbUKh+SoycMpKy0 manish@picanmix4
The key's randomart image is:

</code></pre><p>Optional: In addition you can also setup SSH Key Revocation List (KRL). This is a list of all revoked certificates.</p><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -k -f ca_krl
</code></pre><p>And, thats it. your SSH CA is in business. Now, going forward, you just need to configure your servers and clients to use certificates with private keys.</p><h2 id="ssh-server-configuration">SSH Server Configuration</h2><p>Follow these steps to configure host to use SSH certificates:</p><ol><li>Copy your servers SSH Public Key, typically located under <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</code> or <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub</code> and get it signed.</li></ol><pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -h -s ca_host_key -z &lt;serial no.&gt; -I &lt;hostname&gt; -V &lt;duration&gt; -n &lt;principal list&gt; ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>Copy the certifcate back to the host under <code>/etc/ssh</code></li><li>Copy CA User Public Key(<code>ca_user_key.pub</code>) to the host under <code>/etc/ssh</code></li><li>Add the following to <code>sshd_conf</code> file:</li></ol><pre><code>TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca_user_key.pub
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key-cert.pub
</code></pre><p><code>TrustedUserCAKeys</code> directs SSH to trust certificates signed by <code>ca_user_key</code>. And, <code>HostCertificate</code> directs SSH to send the host certificate instead of public key to the client.
5. Restart SSH</p><pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre><h2 id="ssh-client-configuration">SSH Client Configuration</h2><p>Follow the following steps to configure client/user to use SSH certificates:</p><ol><li>Copy user’s SSH Public Key (typically located under <code>&lt;usershome&gt;/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>.

To ease that burden one can use a centralized system such as
<a href="https://keyper.dbsentry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keyper</a>. Keyper is an Open Source SSH Key and Certificate-Based Authentication Manager. Keyper acts as an SSH Certificate Authority (CA) and it standardizes and centralizes the storage of SSH public keys and SSH Certificates for all Linux users in your organization saving significant time and effort it takes to manage SSH public keys and certificates on each Linux Server. Keyper also maintains an active Key Revocation List, which prevents the use of Key/Cert once revoked. Keyper is a lightweight container taking less than 100MB. It is launched either using Docker or Podman. You can be up and running within minutes instead of days.<br><code>&lt;/Shameless-Plug&gt;</code></p><p>Thats it folks! Happy more secure SSH’ing.</p></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/saas-vs-subscription | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/saas-vs-subscription">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>The three key characteristics of a SaaS company are: subscription, high margin, and scalability. There are so many new business models and new applications of existing business models into new markets that capture one or two of these, but in order to get the high multiples that SaaS companies achieve, it's critical to have all three. In addition, the "rule of thumb" metrics that I previously mentioned don't work so well in the absence of any of these characteristics. While the fundamental subscription math remains true, you have to dig much deeper to understand the impact on the cash flows, working capital needs, scalability, customer lifetime value and long term profitability to be able to assess the health and viability of a business.</p><p>For example, if we look at <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, which priced its IPO today (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1691421/000104746920003943/a2242013z424b4.htm">424B4 here</a>). Lemonade is a technology-enabled insurance company and insurance broker. I think most people would agree that it is not a software company. But if we look through the lens of these three characteristics and some of the key metrics, we can learn a lot about its long term prospects as a business.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Insurance is probably one of the original subscription businesses, with people paying annual or monthly premiums. Revenue comes in regularly to support the clients’ claims.</li><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Assuming there's access to re-insurance and the capital to back up the insurance plans, this business is highly scalable and in a huge market.</li><li><strong>Margins:</strong> This is where it gets a bit more complicated. This is not a 90% margin, AWS-expense only business. It's a complicated financial cycle and risk assessment business with very different capital, accounting and cash flow dynamics. Lemonade runs a few different businesses with varying risk ownership which have an impact on gross profit, and overall they achieved a gross margin of 17% in 2019.</li></ol><p>Now let's take a look at some of the key metrics:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>LTV</strong>: In most software businesses, especially those either creating or selling into new markets, it's almost impossible to calculate a lifetime value because we don't have enough data on the lifetime of a customer. In the insurance business, there's tons of data going back decades for hundreds of millions of people. Insurance companies run on actuarial science, which one could argue is the original data science application. To put it lightly, they understand data and have lots of it. While in a new-fangled enterprise or consumer software business, lifetime value is a shot in the dark, in the insurance business it's not, where it's reasonable to expect your customers to stay with you for 25+ years.</li><li><strong>CAC Payback</strong>: Knowing you can keep your customers for a very long time is great and now you can calculate the CAC you can afford to invest in order to acquire them. Lemonade runs efficiently now with $1 of marketing to $2 of in-force premium on their platform. Gross margin-adjusted this obviously shifts the timeline out, but that's OK because the likelihood of keeping the customers for a long time is high. This introduces a new question: capital. With short paybacks, cash management isn't so much of a challenge, but as those payback times increase, so does the need to fund the working capital needs of the business. The time value of money becomes a factor here, but is manageable and calculable.</li></ol><p>So a quick look through the lens of the fundamental subscription concepts makes it clear that even though Lemonade is not a software business, it is a subscription business with some highly favorable business and customer economics.</p><p>And congrats to the Lemonade team on the IPO!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f6128d02bc85546e3a93976_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Faa34c7a7-d833-453f-a3cb-79b88beb7eda_1536x1025.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>MPEG is releasing three new video codecs in 2020-2021 called Versatile Video Coding (H.266), Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1), and Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2). Let’s take a look at the highlights of each of these codecs and what they bring to the table.</strong></p>




<h2 id="video-compression-is-critical-to-your-infrastructure"><span id="Video_Compression_is_Critical_To_Your_Infrastructure"></span>Video Compression is Critical To Your Infrastructure<span></span></h2>



<p>Video traffic is growing by the day and that is not going to stop any time soon. The pandemic might have stymied other industries, but, has actually given a filip to the streaming industry, because people are stuck indoors, and watching videos provides a much-needed escape from the daily routine!</p>



<p>Video Compression is a critical component in the video delivery pipeline and can make a massive make-or-break impression in the minds of the end-user. If you “tune” your encoders to maximize video quality, you’ll have to compromise on compression efficiency and spend more bits; and vice-versa. If you compromise on compression efficiency and create larger files, then you will have to spend more on CDN delivery costs.</p>



<p>So, the goal of every encoder team is to create a fine-balance between quality and bitrate. In other words, balance video quality with dollars.</p>



<p>The easiest way to perform this balancing act is to upgrade to the best encoder or encoding technology on the market. Hypothetically, this is simple, but practically, this is difficult. You need to make sure that the quality-complexity-efficiency trade-offs are met and decoder support is available amongst other things.</p>



<h2 id="the-failure-of-hevc"><span id="The_Failure_of_HEVC"></span>The Failure of HEVC<span></span></h2>



<p>When we talk about encoders, the discussion isn’t complete without mentioning H.264/AVC which is still ruling supreme since its introduction by MPEG (in 2003, I think). The MPEG announced a successor to H.264/AVC and called it H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) that had a slew of new coding tools such as quadtree decomposition, new picture types, SAO filtering, etc.</p>



<p>However, HEVC turned out to be a flop and the failure of HEVC had almost nothing to do with the algorithms. For HEVC R&amp;D teams, getting 20-30% gains over AVC was easy. </p>



<p><strong>You may disagree, but, as someone who wrote HEVC code for years, I stand by what I said.</strong></p>



<p>The “failure” of MPEG’s H.265/HEVC was due to patent-pools and licensing issues and this created the need for a new codec to fill the gap left by HEVC and to replace H.264/AVC (which by-design will struggle to compress 4K, UHD, and large resolutions).</p>



<p>In this regards, MPEG has announced that three new video codecs will soon be standardized and they are :-</p>



<ul><li>Versatile Video Coding (H.266)</li><li>Essential Video Coding (EVC MPEG-5 Part 1)</li><li>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC MPEG-5 Part 2)</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a quick look at the objective of each of these codecs and see what gap they’re trying to plug, shall we?</p>

<p>Touted as a successor to HEVC, the Versatile Video Coding standard has a lofty goal of achieving at least a 30% improvement in compression efficiency over HEVC. This should be doable considering the allowance of the “10x complexity increase” that the committee has provided.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17074.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MPEG Requirements document</a>&nbsp;for VVC (H.266), a few interesting points stand out with regards to compression efficiency, coding complexity, etc.</p>



<ul><li><strong>A substantial improvement in compression efficiency compared to HEVC Main Profile is required for the target application(s);</strong>&nbsp;at no point of the entire bit rate range shall it be worse than existing standard(s).&nbsp;<strong>30% bitrate reduction for the same perceptual quality is sufficient for some important use-cases and may justify a future video coding standard</strong>. Other use-cases may require higher bit-rate reductions such as 50%.</li><li><strong>Encoding complexity of approximately 10 times or more than that of HEVC</strong>&nbsp;is acceptable for many applications.</li><li><strong>The standard shall enable the use of efficient prediction structures (e.g. so-called open groups of pictures) without compromising from the fast and seamless representation switching capability between representations of different properties, such as different spatial resolutions.</strong></li><li>Support for&nbsp;<strong>progressive scanning shall be required for all Profiles and Levels</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>What stands out to me the most in the Requirements document are the references to “<strong>fast-switching</strong>” and “<strong>progressive scanning</strong>“. This is a clear indication of the importance that the MPEG body is placing on OTT streaming&nbsp;<em>(and the implicit absence of interlaced video in OTT)</em>.</p>



<p>This was a HUGE problem in HEVC where interlaced support was an after-thought; and it lead to a lot of code-wrangling to retro-fit interlaced support into commercial codecs. I hope VVC does not tread the same interlaced path.</p>



<p>The second comment about fast-switching is interesting and might put pressure on codec vendors to insert more IDRs in the bitstream to support smaller segment sizes and clean, fast, switching between profiles in the ABR bitrate ladder. The reference to open-gops is interesting, because Open-GOPs are very helpful in increasing compression efficiency – so this is something fun to watch out for.</p>



<p>Whenever a discussion about MPEG’s video codecs comes up, the elephant in the room has to be&nbsp;<strong>licensing</strong>. Fraunhofer HHI said in their&nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a>&nbsp;that,</p>



<blockquote><p>A uniform and transparent licensing model based on the FRAND principle (i.e., fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) is planned to be established for the use of standard essential patents related to H.266/VVC. For this purpose, the Media Coding Industry Forum (MC-IF) was founded.</p></blockquote>



<p>I hope VVC pans out because I’d love to see it in action crunching 4K/8K videos!</p>

<h2 id="essential-video-coding---evc-mpeg-5-part-1"><span id="Essential_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_EVC_(MPEG5_Part_1)"></span>Essential Video Coding – EVC (MPEG-5 Part 1)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 EVC or Essential Video Coding is an MPEG standard backed by Samsung, Huawei, Qualcomm, Divideon as a response to the patent pool mess that HEVC ran it that essentially stymied large-scale adoption of a powerful video compression standard.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/files/standards/parts/docs/w17928.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements of the EVC standard</a>&nbsp;were very clearly specified by MPEG as follows –</p>



<ul><li>The test model should consist of two tool sets:&nbsp;<strong>a base and an enhanced tool set</strong></li><li>The base tool set should be configured with tools that were made public more than 20 years ago or for which a Type 1 declaration is received</li><li>There should be additional tools in the enhanced tool set, each of which shall provide a significant improvement in coding efficiency and be capable of being cleanly switched off on an individual basis</li></ul>



<p>EVC’s aim is crystal-clear – provide a royalty-free option for content producers while also providing adequate tools, algorithms, and knobs to produce higher quality video (than the base tool set). And, the enhancement layer’s tools (also referred to as the Main layer) will be subject to royalties.</p>



<p>Sounds good, eh?</p>

<p>It is also interesting to note the following sentence from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBC 2019 paper on EVC</a>&nbsp;and I quote,</p>



<blockquote><p>No considerations have been taken on licensing aspects of the technology other than a requirement for FRAND commitment by the contributors.&nbsp;<strong>Commercial aspects, and in particular, licensing aspects have been handled externally and independently of MPEG.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>They’ve been handled, huh? Okay cool, but I still cross my fingers and say a prayer when I hear “MPEG” and “Licensing” in the same sentence.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that EVC is adopted and supported in the industry quickly – its a good concept and means well.</p>



<p>In a future article, we will do a deep dive into the tools supported in the Base and the Main layers of EVC.</p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibc.org/download?ac=10463" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Emerging MPEG-5 EVC Standard – Applications, Technology, and Results presented at IBC 2019</a></p>



<h2 id="low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding---lcevc-mpeg-5-part-2"><span id="Low_Complexity_Enhancement_Video_Coding_%E2%80%93_LCEVC_(MPEG5_Part_2)"></span>Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding – LCEVC (MPEG-5 Part 2)<span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG-5 Part 2 LCEVC is being introduced with the aim of increased compression efficiency for existing codecs at little or no-increase in coding complexity by using a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</p>



<p>The LCEVC codec’s output is essentially a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by an existing video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with enhancement layers that can be used conditionally to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the end-user’s experience.</p>



<p>This concept is nicely captured in the figure below taken from Guido Meardi’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20191008/Documents/Guido_Meardi_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>&nbsp;at the ITU Workshop on the Future of Media in Geneva.</p>

<h2 id="what-next"><span id="What_Next"></span>What Next?<span></span></h2>



<p>I think 2020 and 2021 present great challenges and opportunities for the field of video compression.</p>



<p>With consumption increasing due to the COVID-19 situation, most content providers are under the gun to reduce their streaming costs. Dropping the bitrates is one way of reducing your streaming costs, but, conversely, it will be hard to compete with the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Peacock, fuboTV, DAZN with poor video quality.</p>



<p>If the compression experts can pull off VVC’s goals of 30% bitrate savings over HEVC, then it will be a huge win. The only thing they’ll have to ensure is that they don’t blow their foot off with licensing issues (<em>a-la-HEVC</em>). If things work out properly, VVC should be a good competitor to AV1 especially at high resolutions such as 4K and 8K.</p>

</section><p>What if I told you that $2=1$? You may say I’m wrong. OK, well, what if I proved it to you? We can both agree that there’s an $x$ and a $y$ where $x = y$. From there, <a href="https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/one-equals-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiply, subtract, factorise, divide, substitute, divide again</a>, and you get $2 = 1$.</p>
<p>Still not happy? You’re probably unconvinced by my so-called ‘proof’. OK, I say, and, after a minute, hand you a sheet of paper with the following hastily scrawled on it: <a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=204%2C188" alt="" width="204" height="188" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=300%2C277 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1.png?w=470 470w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>It’s better, but you’re still displeased. This time, I’ve made clear what steps I’m taking from $x = y$ to $2 = 1$. However, you point out, I don’t connect any of these steps. Nodding slowly, I take my time and write out a very nice, orderly proof, complete with justifications for each line:<a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=454%2C241" alt="" width="454" height="241" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?w=1200 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=300%2C160 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=1024%2C544 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=768%2C408 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>At this point, you spot my mistake: in going from line 4 to 5, I have divided both sides by $x-y$. But we began with the assumption that $x = y$, meaning that $x-y = 0$, and dividing by 0 is not defined! This means that lines 5 to 7 are operating on nonexistent values and are therefore meaningless.</p>
<p>You’re happy with yourself, but something is bothering you. To reveal my mistake, you asked me to be more precise. But why stop here? Because you found what you were looking for? That’s not how truth is found.</p>
<p>My proof, like all proofs, is a path from one statement to another, just as we may follow the path from $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to $x = \big(-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}\big)/{2a}$, or from the existence of rectangles to the transitivity of parallelism (see below). Along this path I have made several intermediate statements, and linked them together with justifications. You found that one of my links is flawed, and you wonder how we know that the others aren’t also wrong. You begin to question foundational principles, wondering, for instance, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/805939/24325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why we’re even allowed to do the same thing to both sides of an equation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Euclidean geometry:</strong> For the unfamiliar—Euclidean geometry (standard geometry on a flat surface) rests on 5 assumptions, one of which (the <em>parallel postulate</em>) has historically been regarded as ugly. In attempting to eliminate the parallel postulate, mathematicians have found numerous other statements that are equivalent to it, such as that a rectangle exists or that parallelism is transitive.</p>
<p>You keep digging deeper and deeper, questioning more and more of what you previously took to be correct. Eventually, you come across a piece of mathematics that is perhaps the most beautiful and elegant thing you’ve ever laid your eyes upon: <em>natural deduction</em>.</p>
<h2>Natural deduction</h2>
<p>Natural deduction is one result of asking for deeper and deeper justification when doing maths. A system of natural deduction is a set of very simple, almost irrefutable rules that act to formalise our intuition about what is <em>definitely true</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_15535"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15535" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=124%2C71" alt="" width="124" height="71" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?w=293 293w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 124px) 100vw, 124px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15535">Reiteration (R): if $P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>These rules include such things as <em>reiteration</em>, which simply allows us to repeat ourselves. Precisely, reiteration says that if you know that a statement $P$ is true, then you can conclude that $P$ is true. This is hardly controversial.</p>
<div id="attachment_15536"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15536" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=193%2C120" alt="" width="193" height="120" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?w=422 422w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=300%2C187 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15536">Conjunction introduction ($\land$I): if $P$ and $Q$ then $P\land Q$.</p></div>
<p>There are two rules for the natural idea of ‘and’. First is the so-called <em>conjunction introduction</em> rule, stating that if you know that $P$ and $Q$ are both true, then you may conclude $P \land Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ and $Q$’. On the other side, we have <em>conjunction elimination</em>, stating that if you know that $P \land Q$ is true, then you may conclude $P$ and also may conclude $Q$.</p>
<div id="attachment_15537"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15537" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=176%2C121" alt="" width="176" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?w=384 384w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=300%2C205 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15537">Conjunction elimination ($\land$E): if $P\land Q$, then $P$ and $Q$.</p></div>
<p>These rules don’t feel like they do much besides swapping out ‘and’ for ‘$\land$’; however, doing so is important for formality and precision.</p>
<div id="attachment_15538"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15538" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=172%2C78" alt="" width="172" height="78" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?w=373 373w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=300%2C136 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15538">Disjunction introduction ($\lor$I): if $P$, then $P\lor Q$.</p></div>
<p>Things start to get tricky with the rules codifying ‘or’. The first, <em>disjunction introduction</em>, tells us that if $P$ is true, then you may conclude $P \lor Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ or $Q$’: if I am hungry, then it’s also true that I’m either hungry or tired.</p>
<div id="attachment_15539"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15539" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=258%2C332" alt="" width="258" height="332" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?w=568 568w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=232%2C300 232w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15539">Disjunction elimination ($\lor$E): if $P\lor Q$ and from $P$ we can prove $X$ and from $Q$ we can prove $X$, then $X$.</p></div>
<p>The second rule, <em>disjunction elimination</em>, states that if $P \lor Q$ is true, and from $P$ you can prove $X$, and from $Q$ you can prove $X$, then you may conclude $X$. More colloquially, if either $P$ or $Q$ is true, and in both cases $X$ is true, too, then $X$ is true. For example, if I’m either well-rested or well-fed, and being well-rested makes me happy, and being well-fed makes me happy, then I must be happy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15540"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15540" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=222%2C212" alt="" width="222" height="212" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?w=472 472w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=300%2C287 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15540">Implication introduction ($\Rightarrow$I): if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then $P\Rightarrow Q$.</p></div>
<p>Then come the rules regarding implication. We have <em>implication introduction</em>, stating that if from $P$ we can prove $Q$, then we may conclude $P \Rightarrow Q$, pronounced ‘$P$ implies $Q$’. And we have <em>implication elimination</em> (also known as <em>modus ponens</em>), which states that if $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true and $P$ is true, then we can conclude $Q$. If the weather being rainy implies that I am cosy, and the weather is rainy, then I must be cosy.</p>
<div id="attachment_15541"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15541" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=220%2C121" alt="" width="220" height="121" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?w=477 477w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=300%2C165 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15541">Implication elimination ($\Rightarrow$E): if $P\Rightarrow Q$ and $P$, then $Q$.</p></div>
<p>Finally, we come to the most arcane rules, those handling negation. The negation of $P$ is written $\neg P$ and pronounced ‘not $P$’. Before talking about the $\neg P$ rules, however, we must first introduce a new symbol: $\bot$ (pronounced ‘bottom’), which represents impossibility or contradiction. We can then introduce <em>bottom introduction</em>, which states that if both $P$ and $\neg P$ are true, which is absurd (usually… there are systems of logic that admit both $P$ and $\neg P$ at the same time, called <em>paraconsistent</em> logics), then we can conclude $\bot$, to represent this impossibility.</p>
<div id="attachment_15542"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15542" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=195%2C134" alt="" width="195" height="134" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?w=383 383w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=300%2C206 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.png?resize=1%2C1 1w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15542">Bottom introduction ($\bot$I): if $P$ and $\neg P$, then $\bot$.</p></div>
<p>We’re then able to make use of $\bot$ through <em>negation introduction</em>, which states that if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then we can conclude $\neg P$. This is reasonable; if $P$ being true led to a contradiction, then $P$ isn’t true, so $\neg P$ is.</p>
<div id="attachment_15543"><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15543" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=228%2C231" alt="" width="228" height="231" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?w=443 443w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=295%2C300 295w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11.png?resize=45%2C45 45w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15543">Negation introduction ($\neg$I): if from $P$ we can prove $\bot$, then $\neg P$.</p></div>
<p>Finally we have <em>negation elimination</em>. This one is a nice easy way to end: it says that if we know $\neg \neg P$, then we can conclude $P$. If something isn’t not true, then it must be true!</p>
<div id="attachment_15532"><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15532" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=173%2C78" alt="" width="173" height="78" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?w=372 372w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=300%2C135 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12.png?resize=2%2C1 2w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15532">Negation elimination ($\neg$E): if $\neg\neg P$, then $P$.</p></div>
<p>And with that, we have completed (one kind of) natural deduction, laying out a framework for proofs based on undeniable principles so that we can be <em>completely</em> confident in our results.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering, hey, maths is about numbers and shapes and functions and vector fields, but all we’ve been working with are $P$s and $Q$s! Not a single $n$ or $x$, let alone an $f$, has been written so far!</p>
<p>Fear not! Purely logical systems such as natural deduction are key ingredient for building typical maths. For example, to define numbers, we may first extend to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-precise-difference-between-propositional-and-predicate-logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicate logic</a>, then construct the naturals (via the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peano axioms</a></em>), which we’ll use to make the <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~pavel/syllabi_old/aluffi_321/NZ.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integers</a> and the <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/groisser/files/rationals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rationals</a> (via equivalence classes), then finally the reals (via <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedekind cuts</a></em>).</p>
<p>So, in fact, we still we get to work with all the maths we’re used to! Plus, due to the use of natural deduction, we have the added benefit of being confident about what we’re doing at every layer of abstraction!</p>
<p><strong>Predicate and propositional logic:</strong> The logic we’ve been building, with $\land$, $\lor$, $\Rightarrow$, $\neg$, and $\bot$, is known as <em>propositional</em> or <em>zeroth-order logic</em>. <em>Predicate</em> or <em>first-order logic</em> is an extension of propositional logic wherein our statements ($P$, $Q$, $X$, etc) may be parametrised. So as well as having $H$ mean that ‘I am hungry’, we may also have $\mathcal H(x)$ mean that ‘$x$ is hungry’. Additionally, predicate logic includes two <em>quantifiers</em>, $\forall$ and $\exists$, which respectively mean ‘for every’ and ‘there exists’: $\forall x \mathcal H(x)$ means that everyone is hungry, and $\exists x \mathcal H(x)$ means that (at least) one person is hungry.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like I was at age 17, or anything like how I portrayed you in the beginning of this article, you’re drooling right now. It’s like all of your fantasies regarding rigour and precision have been heard and answered by divine mathematicians.</p>
<p>But maybe you’re not intrinsically motivated by rigour, so you’re less excited by natural deduction. Which is fine! I’m not hurt. Maybe a little bit. Or maybe you just feel that this is overkill—did you <em>really</em> need all this work to know that $2 \neq 1$? Or maybe you’re not convinced that these rules are correct; perhaps you don’t agree that from $\neg \neg P$ we can conclude $P$.</p>
<p><strong>Excluding the middle:</strong> If you don’t agree, you are not alone! That $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$ is a consequence of a rule called the <em>law of excluded middle</em>, which states that $P \lor \neg P$. (This law is built-in to the system of natural deduction that we created.) Some mathematicians (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the <em>intuitionists</em> or <em>constructionists</em></a>) reject the law of excluded middle, thus also forfeiting that $\neg \neg P$ entails $P$. One reason to question the law of excluded middle is that it allows us to state that something exists without stating what it is. For instance, we are able to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/104121/243259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prove that an irrational number raised to the power of an irrational number can be rational</a>, but <em>without</em> giving an actual example. If we reject the law of excluded middle, then all such proofs must <em>actually construct</em> an example.</p>
<p>Still, I posit, natural deduction is worth your time. Because we’ve been so rigorous in building the system up, we gain the benefit of knowing <em>exactly what we’re talking about</em>. Before establishing such precision, we may have used $P \Rightarrow Q$, but without a sense of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>
