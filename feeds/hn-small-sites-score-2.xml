<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes is an open-source project that “containerizes” workloads and services and manages deployment and configurations. Released by Google in 2015, Kubernetes is now maintained by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. Since its release, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/">cloud native companies use</a> it, SaaS vendors offer commercial prebuilt versions, and there’s even an annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/">convention</a>!<br></p><p>What has made Kubernetes become such a fundamental service? A major factor is its automation capabilities. Kubernetes can automatically make changes to the configuration of deployed containers or even deploy new containers based on metrics it tracks or requests made by engineers. Having Kubernetes handle these processes saves time, eliminates toil, and increases consistency.<br></p><p>If these benefits sound familiar, it might be because they overlap with the philosophies of SRE. But how do you incorporate the automation of Kubernetes into your SRE practices? In this blog post, we’ll explain the Kubernetes Operator—the Kubernetes function at the heart of customized automation—and discuss how it can evolve your SRE solution.</p><h3>What the Kubernetes Operator can do</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Operators-Automating-Container-Orchestration/dp/1492048046"><em>Kubernetes Operators: Automating the Container Orchestration Platform</em></a>, authors Jason Dobies and Joshua Wood describe an Operator as “an automated Site Reliability Engineer for its application.” Given an SRE’s multifaceted experience and diverse workload, this is a bold statement. So what exactly can the Operator do?</p><h4>Kubernetes Operators complete sophisticated tasks</h4><p>The Operator can complete complex tasks in order to achieve the desired changes in the application’s output. It can automatically handle such tasks as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Deploying applications</li><li>Updating applications to new versions</li><li>Reconfiguring application settings</li><li>Scaling applications up and down depending on usage</li><li>Failure handling</li><li>Setting up monitoring infrastructure<br></li></ul><p>Without Kubernetes Operators, engineers would need to complete these tasks. Automating them saves time and toil, and makes the procedures and results consistent.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators control custom resources and applications</h4><p>Kubernetes allows you to create and define custom resources based on specific applications. The custom resource is a data object generated by your application containing metrics on the application's state. Imagine you have an application that produces new server instances based on usage. You could define your custom resource to check RAM and disk space for each new instance. You can also define a custom resource as a target that the application is trying to match. The Kubernetes Operator can then control the application to achieve the target custom resource; if the application is spinning up servers that have insufficient RAM or disk space, the Operator can reconfigure the settings to match the desired amount.<br></p><h4>Kubernetes Operators make stateful decisions</h4><p>The Kubernetes Operator is able to modify the configuration and usage of an application based on the application’s output. This is determined by the custom resources defined for that application. Custom resources showing the desired state and custom resources showing the current state form a loop. The Operator observes the current state and then takes actions that will make the application produce the desired state. After the actions are executed, the current state is reevaluated and the loop begins again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, a custom resource could define the desirable state of a new server instance as some amount of load capability based on its physical resources.The Operator would then adjust the configuration until new instances reached these standards.</p><h3>Kubernetes Operators and SRE</h3><p>If you’re using Kubernetes, you’ll find that building and implementing Operators aligns with your SRE goals.</p><h4>Operator monitoring, SLIs, and SLOs</h4><p>When developing the custom resource for your application, you need to choose which signals from the application’s output will be monitored by the resource and which targets the Operator will steer the application toward. This is similar to creating <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">SLIs</a> and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The process of determining metrics with greatest impact is similar for Operators and SLIs. In the <em>Kubernetes Operators</em> textbook, Dobies and Wood suggest looking first at the “four golden signals” (<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/">a concept from Google’s SRE book</a>) to determine what the Operator should monitor. These are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Latency</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Errors</li><li>Saturation<br></li></ul><p>Creating Operators for your applications will help you understand what SLIs and SLOs should be set for them. Likewise, setting SLIs and SLOs can help you understand what your Operators should monitor.<br></p><p>You might notice that when servers are overloaded, your customers are unhappy with the application’s availability.<br></p><p>You can set a custom resource to monitor the disk space available. At 5% remaining capacity, your custom resource will spin up new server instances, giving your customers better service. Your SLI will be based on availability and will monitor disk space. Your SLO might dictate that you need to achieve 99.9% availability to keep your customers happy, informing the Operator’s intervention points.</p><h4>Automating SRE application deployment</h4><p>Your SRE practice will involve applications being deployed on a regular basis for each new instance of a service. For example, you may want to deploy a monitoring application every time you implement a new area of system architecture. Kubernetes Operators can expedite and automate this process. For monitoring, the <a href="https://coreos.com/blog/the-prometheus-operator.html">Prometheus Operator</a> is one of the first Operators developed by Kubernetes. It automatically deploys and controls a new instance of the open-source monitoring software <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> onto any targeted clusters.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/choosing-sre-tools">SRE tools</a> represent an investment in reliability. The time spent implementing them is paid for by the time they save. Creating Operators is a similar investment. By creating Operators, you save time on each deployment. Furthermore, deployments are consistent and reliable. Your SRE practices have less overhead and can scale with your organization.</p><h4>Operators and incident management</h4><p>Operators can be set up to make adjustments to handle failure. If the application’s custom resource varies from the desired result, the Operator will make changes to compensate until the desired state is achieved. The cause of the variation is irrelevant to the Operator. It only operates based on the current and desired states. You will still need to work through an incident retrospective to bubble up contributing factors.<br></p><p>When developing your incident response plan, the behavior of your Operators can be a valuable resource. If you know that the Operator will automatically try to correct the behavior, you can incorporate that into your expectations and procedures. For example, if you have an incident response plan for oversaturated servers, your Operator could spin up new server instances or reconfigure load balancing. Your response plan would take this into account, saving you some troubleshooting steps and allowing you to focus on the originating issue. By combining Operators and <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">automated runbooks</a>, you can minimize the amount of manual escalation and resolve many incidents without human intervention. As automation is another core goal of SRE, this is another way that Kubernetes Operators fit into your reliability strategy.<br></p><p>As you shift your services to a container-based model and Kubernetes becomes more fundamental to your DevOps practices, it’s important to incorporate Operators into your reliability strategy. Operators allow you to extend Kubernetes with custom resources and responses, allowing for more automation and less toil.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you enjoyed this post, check out these resources:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/webinar-modern-metrics">Webinar: Modern Metrics to Understand Operational Health</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/how-to-choose-monitoring-tools">How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SRE</a></li><li><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">How to Classify Incidents</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>The course is two-fold.</p>
<p>On the one hand it introduces functional programming: Immutable data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, functions as first-class values, proper tail calls, type-directed programming and functional programming patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand it introduces 'Property-based testing' (QuickCheck) (next generation automated testing) expressed within the functional programming context: Generators, properties, shrinking, statistics of generators, type-directed testing, testing of imperative code while touching upon a number of more general testing concepts as debugging, unit-testing, corner cases, blackbox and whitebox testing and fuzzing.</p>
<p>Finally the course covers a number of real-world case studies of property-based testing, e.g., an automated test of the AUTOSAR specification for Volvo.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in creating something similar, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot">full code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-threejs">Getting Started with Three.js</h2>

<p>Three.js is a JavaScript library that generates lower-level code for WebGL, the standard API for 3D rendering in a web browser. Using Three.js, one can build complex 3D environments that would take much more code to build in raw WebGL. For a quick sample of the projects others have built with the library, check out the <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js homepage</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with Three.js, one needs to provide a bit of boilerplate code with the three essential elements of a Three.js page:</p>

<p><strong>scene</strong>: The scene contains all objects to be rendered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the scene and a camera to view it</span>
<span>var</span> <span>scene</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Scene</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>camera</strong>: The camera determines the position from which viewers see the scene:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Specify the portion of the scene visiable at any time (in degrees)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>fieldOfView</span> <span>=</span> <span>75</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the camera's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>aspectRatio</span> <span>=</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span> <span>/</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Specify the near and far clipping planes. Only objects</span>
<span>// between those planes will be rendered in the scene</span>
<span>// (these values help control the number of items rendered</span>
<span>// at any given time)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>nearPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>farPlane</span> <span>=</span> <span>1000</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use the values specified above to create a camera</span>
<span>var</span> <span>camera</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PerspectiveCamera</span><span>(</span>
  <span>fieldOfView</span><span>,</span> <span>aspectRatio</span><span>,</span> <span>nearPlane</span><span>,</span> <span>farPlane</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Finally, set the camera's position in the z-dimension</span>
<span>camera</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>renderer</strong>: The renderer renders the scene to a canvas element on an HTML page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create the canvas with a renderer and tell the</span>
<span>// renderer to clean up jagged aliased lines</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>WebGLRenderer</span><span>({</span><span>antialias</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>});</span>

<span>// Specify the size of the canvas</span>
<span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>setSize</span><span>(</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>innerHeight</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the canvas to the DOM</span>
<span>document</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span> <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>domElement</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The code above creates the scene, adds a camera, and renders the canvas to the DOM. Now all we need to do is add some objects to the scene.</p>

<p>Each item rendered in a Three.js scene has a <strong>geometry</strong> and a <strong>material</strong>. Geometries use vertices (points) and faces (polygons described by vertices) to define the shape of an object, and materials use textures and colors to define the appearance of that shape. A geometry and a material can be combined into a <strong>mesh</strong>, which is a fully composed object ready to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>The example below uses the high-level <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/BoxGeometry">BoxGeometry</a>, which comes with pre-built vertices and faces:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a cube with width, height, and depth set to 1</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>BoxGeometry</span><span>(</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Use a simple material with a specified hex color</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshBasicMaterial</span><span>({</span> <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span> <span>});</span>

<span>// Combine the geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>cube</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span> <span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span> <span>);</span>

<span>// Add the mesh to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span> <span>cube</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, to render the scene on the page, one must call the <code>render()</code> method, passing in the scene and the camera as arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Combining the snippets above gives the following result:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="WXdYpx" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The Simplest Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/WXdYpx/">The Simplest Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>This is great, but the scene is static. To add some <strong>animation</strong> to the scene, one can periodically update the cube’s rotation property, then rerender the scene. To do so, one can replace the <code>renderer.render()</code> line above with a render loop that calls itself recursively. Here is a standard render loop in Three.js:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>

  <span>// Rotate the object a bit each animation frame</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>cube</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Adding this block at the bottom of the script makes the cube slowly rotate:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="vWpvNL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animating the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/vWpvNL/">Animating the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>Adding <strong>lights</strong> to the scene can make it easier to differentiate the faces of the cube. To add lights to the scene above, we’ll first want to change the cube’s material, because as the documentation says the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial">MeshBasicMaterial</a> is not affected by lights. Let’s replace the material defined above with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/materials/MeshPhongMaterial">MeshPhongMaterial</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshPhongMaterial</span><span>({</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>0xffff00</span><span>})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next let’s point a light at the cube so that different faces of the cube catch different amounts of light:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Add a point light with #fff color, .7 intensity, and 0 distance</span>
<span>var</span> <span>light</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PointLight</span><span>(</span><span>0xffffff</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>7</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Specify the light's position in the x, y, and z dimensions</span>
<span>light</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Add the light to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>light</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mqparr" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Lighting the Cube">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/mqparr/">Lighting the Cube</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adding-images-to-a-scene">Adding Images to a Scene</h2>

<p>The snippets above give a quick overview of the core elements of a Three.js scene. The following section will build upon those ideas to create a TSNE map of images.</p>

<p>To build an image viewer, we’ll need to load some image files into some Three.js materials. We can do so by using the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/loaders/TextureLoader">TextureLoader</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// Create a texture loader so we can load the image file</span>
<span>var</span> <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>TextureLoader</span><span>();</span>

<span>// Specify the path to an image</span>
<span>var</span> <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/tsne-webgl/assets/cat.jpg'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Load an image file into a MeshLambert material</span>
<span>var</span> <span>material</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>MeshLambertMaterial</span><span>({</span>
  <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the material is ready, the remaining steps are to generate a geometry from the image, combine the material and geoemtry into a mesh, and add the mesh to the scene, just like the cube example above. Because images are two-dimensional planes, we can use a simple <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/geometries/PlaneGeometry">PlaneGeometry</a> for this object’s geometry:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a plane geometry for the image with a width of 10</span>
<span>// and a height that preserves the image's aspect ratio</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>PlaneGeometry</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>75</span><span>);</span>

<span>// combine the image geometry and material into a mesh</span>
<span>var</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Mesh</span><span>(</span><span>geometry</span><span>,</span> <span>material</span><span>);</span>

<span>// set the position of the image mesh in the x,y,z dimensions</span>
<span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>// add the image to the scene</span>
<span>scene</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The image will now appear in the scene:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jaYdLg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/jaYdLg/">Adding an Image to a Three.js Scene</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that one can swap out the PlanarGeometry for other geometries and Three.js will automatically wrap the material over the new geometry. The example below, for instance, swaps the PlanarGeometry for a more interesting Icosahedron geometry, and rotates the icosahedron inside the render loop:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// use an icosahedron geometry instead of the planar geometry</span>
<span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>IcosahedronGeometry</span><span>();</span>

<span>// spin the icosahedron each animation frame</span>
<span>function</span> <span>animate</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
<span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span> <span>animate</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>renderer</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span> <span>scene</span><span>,</span> <span>camera</span> <span>);</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>.</span><span>z</span> <span>+=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>animate</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This produces a strange looking cat indeed:</p>

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="NwXeoB" data-default-tab="result" data-user="duhaime" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Icosahedron Cat">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime/pen/NwXeoB/">Icosahedron Cat</a> by Douglas Duhaime (<a href="https://codepen.io/duhaime">@duhaime</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-custom-geometries">Building Custom Geometries</h2>

<p>The examples above use a few different geometries built into Three.js. Those geometries are based on the fundamental <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Geometry">THREE.Geometry</a> class, which is a primitive geometry one can use to create custom geometries. THREE.Geometry is lower-level than the prebuilt geometries used above, but it gives performance gains that make it worth the effort.</p>

<p>Let’s create a custom geometry by calling the THREE.Geometry constructor, which takes no arguments:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>var</span> <span>geometry</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Geometry</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This geometry object doesn’t do much yet, because it doesn’t have any vertices with which to ariculate a shape. Let’s add four vertices to the geometry, one for each corner of the image. Each vertex takes three arguments, which define the vertex’s x, y, and z positions respectively:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// identify the image width and height</span>
<span>var</span> <span>imageSize</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>7.5</span><span>};</span>

<span>// identify the x, y, z coords where the image should be placed</span>
<span>// inside the scene</span>
<span>var</span> <span>coords</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>3.75</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>};</span>

<span>// add one vertex for each image corner in this order:</span>
<span>// lower left, lower right, upper right, upper left</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>),</span>
  <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Vector3</span><span>(</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>+</span><span>imageSize</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>,</span>
    <span>coords</span><span>.</span><span>z</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that the vertices are in place, we need to add some faces to the geometry. The code below will model an image as two triangle faces, as triangles are performant primitives in the WebGL world. The first triangle will combine the lower-left, lower-right, and upper-right vertices of the image, and the second will triangulate the lower-left, upper-right, and upper-left vertices of the image:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// add the first face (the lower-right triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceOne</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add the second face (the upper-left triangle)</span>
<span>var</span> <span>faceTwo</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>THREE</span><span>.</span><span>Face3</span><span>(</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span>
  <span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>// add those faces to the geometry</span>
<span>geometry</span><span>.</span><span>faces</span><span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>faceOne</span><span>,</span> <span>faceTwo</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome, we now have a geometry with four vertices that describe the corners of the image, and two faces that describe the lower-right and upper-left-hand triangles of the image. The next step is to describe which portions of the cat image should appear in each of the faces of the geometry. To do so, one …</p></div></div>

            <p>As I have mentioned in other posts on this blog (and surely many would agree here), I strongly believe that a great start for designing a program is figuring out good representations for the real world problem one tries to solve, <em>i.e.</em> defining appropriate types.
One helpful technique for that is what one could call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/ijln21/blog_sum_types_in_julia_and_rust/g3f1gtn/"><em>optionality</em></a> .<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Interestingly, it is expressed completely differently in different programming languages which I would like to briefly demonstrate in this article using Rust and Julia as examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong>
Julia and Rust are my favourite programming languages and they are particularly suited to demonstrate my point.
That should not stop you from reading if you use neither of these languages, though!
First, both have a rather intuitive syntax and the code shown here is really basic, so you should be able to follow along.
Second, you can probably substitute your inheritance-using language for Julia (<em>e.g.</em> Java) or your tagged-union-using language for Rust (<em>e.g.</em> Haskell).
Even if not, you might learn something anyway!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>Suppose, you are creating an intergalactic game where players can inhabit three different star systems: Our sun (the <em>solarians</em>), the polar star (the <em>polarians</em>) and Alpha Centauri (the <em>centaurians</em>).
An obvious first step would be to define types for each of these three classes:</p>
<p>In Julia:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>and in Rust (I will stick to this order if not stated otherwise):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Polarian</span>;
<span>struct</span> <span>Centaurian</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>(You would add some fields to those structs, of course, but that’s not the point here.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s say you need to store the player value in another object like a game state:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> GameState
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::???</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>???</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>What type would you use for <code>player</code> in each case?
And what about</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> homestar(player<span>::???</span>)<span>::</span>String
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(player: <span>???</span>) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div><p>These are the questions we’re here for.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-1-inheritance--subtyping">Strategy 1: Inheritance / subtyping</h2>
<h3 id="julia">Julia</h3>
<p>This is very straightforward in Julia.
Define</p>
<p>and make the structs from above subtypes of that:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Polarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Centaurian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Dynamic dispatch then allows you to write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">homestar(player<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> <span>"sun"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Polarian) <span>=</span> <span>"polar star"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Centaurian) <span>=</span> <span>"Alpha Centauri"</span>
homestar(player<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> <span>"unknown"</span> <span># or `error("Unknown player class")`</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<p>Rust does not have subtyping but you can define relations between types via <em>traits</em> (similar to interfaces in other languages).
So, we can try</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and then</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>But what about the <code>GameState</code> struct?
We can make use of <em>trait objects</em>, about which we only know that they implement a certain trait.
We especially don’t know the object’s size so we need to reference to it.
If you’re familiar with Rust, you know that this either means using a “normal” reference (<code>&amp;</code> or <code>&amp;mut</code>) and dealing with life time annotations (not my favourite, to be honest) or using a <code>Box</code>ed value.
If you’re not familiar with that, it doesn’t really matter here anyway.
<code>GameState</code> could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>dyn Player<span>&gt;</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This works, but does restrict us in what we can do with the <code>Player</code> trait, as it needs to be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety"><em>object safe</em></a>.
For example, greeting another player of an arbitrary class</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span>;
    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span><span>&lt;</span>T: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>T</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>would not work anymore.</p>
<p>This would be easy in Julia, though:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Player) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Hi!"</span>)
greet(self<span>::</span>Polarian, other<span>::</span>Solarian) <span>=</span> println(<span>"Your star doesn't even consist of three separate stars? Pathetic!"</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="strategy-1b-constrained-generics">Strategy 1b: Constrained generics</h2>
<p>Both Julia and Rust offer defining generic types with type parameters.
Additionally, one can put constraints on those parameters.
This allows us to do a smiliar thing as in strategy 1 but without hiding the concrete player type in the <code>GameState</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>abstract type</span> Player <span>end</span>
<span>struct</span> Solarian <span>&lt;:</span> Player <span>end</span>

<span>struct</span> GameState{P <span>&lt;:</span> Player}
    daytime<span>::</span><span>UInt</span>
    player<span>::</span>P
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>or</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span> Player { ... }
<span>struct</span> <span>Solarian</span>;
<span>impl</span> Player <span>for</span> Solarian { ... }

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span><span>&lt;</span>P: <span>Player</span><span>&gt;</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>P</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>This approach can be considered more performant in general, as the compiler can emit code for concrete types (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics"><em>monomorphisation</em></a>) instead of carrying around a clumsy super type that keeps track of subtypes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, there is a major concern with this approach: <strong>abstraction leaking</strong>.
Users of the <code>GameState</code> struct now have to decide what concrete type to choose for the parameter <code>P</code>, very strictly so in Rust, not so much in Julia.
This can be okay, but often enough <code>GameState</code> is the right place to deal with that question and really should hide that detail.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb: Consider generics for this problem “deep down” in your code but don’t miss the abstraction level where it needs to be kept inside.</p>
<h2 id="strategy-2-enumerations">Strategy 2: Enumerations</h2>
<p>So far, the approaches were not really satisfying for Rust.
But enumerations come to the rescue!
Enumerations (or enums) are types that consist of a concrete and explicit list of possible values (so called <em>variants</em>).</p>
<h3 id="rust-1">Rust</h3>
<p>In Rust, those values can even have their own data which is perfect for our situation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>PlayerClass</span> {
    Sol(Solarian),
    Pol(Polarian),
    Cent(Centaurian)
}

<span>struct</span> <span>GameState</span> {
    daytime: <span>u64</span>,
    player: <span>PlayerClass</span>
}

<span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>homestar</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> self {
            Sol(_) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span>::from(<span>"sun"</span>),
            ...
        }
    }

    <span>fn</span> <span>greet</span>(<span>&amp;</span>self, other: <span>&amp;</span><span>PlayerClass</span>) {
        <span>use</span> PlayerClass::<span>*</span>;
        <span>match</span> (self, other) {
            (Cent(_), Pol(_)) <span>=&gt;</span> println<span>!</span>(<span>"Hello, fellow three-star-systemer!"</span>),
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This indeed solves all our previous problems and is hence the go-to pattern for this situation.</p>
<h3 id="julia-1">Julia</h3>
<p>Julia does technically have enums, but not really.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia">@enum PlayerClass Sol Pol Cent
</code></pre></div><p>exists and it will give you a type <code>PlayerClass</code> with exactly these three possible values but enums are not a first class citizen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
But that’s not even relevant for us, more importantly, enum variants in Julia are <em>not</em> able to carry additional data with them!
So all the information in the fields of the <code>Solarian</code>, <code>Polarian</code>, and <code>Centaurian</code> struct can not be build into the <code>PlayerClass</code> enum.
There is no way to sensibly implement</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> takedamage!(player<span>::</span>PlayerClass)
    <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>whereas it is trivial in Rust:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span> PlayerClass {
    <span>fn</span> <span>takedamage</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self) {
        <span>match</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> self {
            PlayerClass::Sol(solarian) <span>=&gt;</span> solarian.health <span>-=</span> <span>42</span>,
            ...
        };
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>assuming the struct <code>Solarian</code> has a field <code>health: u64</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You might have guessed it by now, but the general advice is:
<strong>Use subtyping in Julia and enums in Rust.</strong>
One caveat though: Enums can not be extended from the “outside”.
If you plan to let users of your library add new type variants, you will have to use some kind of trait approach.</p>
<p>If you are somewhat familiar with Rust or Julia then a large part of this article is probably very obvious to you.
“Of course I use subtyping, that’s what everybody <em>loves</em> Julia for!” or “Of course I use enums, they’re one of <em>the</em> key features of Rust!” you might say.</p>
<p>However, I find it quite surprising that these two – seemingly rather different – patterns can be used in the same situation.
If you are (without loss of generality) a Julia developer, being aware of the corresponding pattern in Rust might help you design appropriate types faster, should you ever get into that situation; and vice versa.</p>

        <article>
          
<p>30 Aug 2020</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Internet and the ability to self-host content has always been appealing to me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really interested in taking problems and re-working them so that they can be solved without an obvious single point of failure instead of requiring a single central coordinating actor. This can be accomplished using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> networking â€” instead of connecting to a single server, one would connect with multiple other peers on their network. Coincidentally, I also enjoy collecting data. Thus, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent protocol</a></strong> is particularly interesting to me. For this post, I thought I would walk through a conceptual example to help de-mystify how the protocol works.</p>

<p>Upfront warning: there will be a decent amount of hand-waving around the actual networking component of the protocol, since I believe it would just bog down this post (and, realistically, Iâ€™d make a fool of myself).</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>We just finished running an event. Awesome. Maybe it was a conference, an unconference, or somewhere in the middle. It went well and weâ€™re feeling real proud of ourselves. This was also the first year we had talk transcripts as well as a professional photographer. We want to share this content with our organizers! Thereâ€™s one issue thoughâ€¦ the organizers are located all over the world!</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s plenty of options here â€” you could share a SomeCorpCloudServiceâ„¢ Folderâ€¦ maybe run an FTP serverâ€¦ what about physically mailing USB sticks to everyone? All very plausible options. But youâ€™re hesitating. That sounds like a lot of work for you, whether it be paying money for the storage, making sure a device stays plugged in 24/7, or licking tons of envelopes.</p>

<p>What if there was a way your organizers could help forward along the content to other organizers? Maybe some kind of organizer-to-organizer protocolâ€¦ ðŸ¤”</p>

<h3 id="a-first-attempt">A First Attempt</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s think of what we have here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pre-defined list of files we want to share.</li>
  <li>A list of clients (ie. organizers, IP addressesâ€¦ basically the same thing) we want to share these files with. This is called a <strong>swarm</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we develop a simple application. The application will keep track of which files youâ€™ve already downloaded and which ones youâ€™re missing. Itâ€™ll connect you to the swarm and open up individual connections to each person. This might be the entire swarm, or it could be just a few people.</p>

<p>These connections then support the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can announce to the entire swarm which files we have already downloaded. We would do this when we first connect to the swarm, when others connect to the swarm, or when our set of downloaded files changes.</li>
  <li>We can connect to a specific client to send or receive a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The process of sharing works by having a client <em>A</em> check which files it is missing, waiting for another client (<em>B</em>) to announce it has the file, and then communicating with client <em>B</em> to receive the file. Then client <em>A</em> would announce that it now has this file for anyone else who might need it. This lets content propagate through our swarm without always needing to get the files from the same person! That way we are not stuck content-less just because client <em>B</em> decided to go to bed early.</p>

<p>But there seems to be a problem here. Someone needs to provide the content initially, otherwise everyone will just be constantly announcing that they have no files. This is called the <strong>initial seed</strong>.</p>

<p>How would this work in practice? Suppose we have four clients involved and we need to share <code>IMG_3051.jpg</code>. Initially thereâ€™s only three clients in the swarm and none of them have the image. But in the shadows there lurks a mythical fourth client who has yet to connect and who has the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene1.svg" alt="Image showing a swarm of three clients missing the file, with a disconnected fourth client possessing the file" width="300px"></p>

<p>When the client connects, it tells everyone which files it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene2.svg" alt="The fourth client joins the swarm announcing it has the image file." width="300px"></p>

<p>And now things start moving! One of our clients has a fast internet connection, hears this message, realizes â€œhey I need that!â€� and asks for the file. The send completes!</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene3.svg" alt="A send occurs for the file and now a second client has the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Now that it has the file, this client decides to re-announce what it has.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene4.svg" alt="Two clients are now announcing they have the file." width="300px"></p>

<p>Time continues flowing. Our remaining clients have now heard both announcements and can receive the file from either client. The <strong>initial seed</strong> could now leave without leaving clients to dry.</p>

<p><img src="https://dominic.cr/assets/images/file-share/scene5.svg" alt="Everyone now has the files, with sends being issued from each client." width="300px"></p>

<p>With this application, we can now share our content peer-to-peer without needing to remain connected the entire time! Others can take up part of the sharing work.</p>

<h3 id="big-files-slow-connections">Big Files, Slow Connections</h3>

<p>The application is working well! Our organizers are slowly getting all of the generated media. Key word being <em>slowly</em>. Youâ€™ve gotten a few reports now that users will occasionally get stuck waiting ages for some of the larger files (RAW images are quite large after all). Not everyone in our swarm has fast internet connections, so the experience can be sub-optimal if you end up requesting a small file from a fast client and a large file from a slow client.</p>

<p>Your first guess here might be to always prioritize selecting the fastest client in the swarm. That sounds reasonableâ€¦ until they get bombarded with requests. Their home connection slows to a crawl. Eventually, they figure out that Netflix is streaming at awful quality due to the application and decide to close it â€” right as someone had downloaded exactly 99% of the image, leaving them unhappy.</p>

<p>A light bulb goes off in your head: <strong>why not split up our files into smaller pieces</strong>? This kills two birds with one stone! It minimizes the impact of slow connectionsâ€¦ downloading 100Kb from a slow connection is less painful than trying to download 100Mb. It also helps avoid re-downloading! If you are on a slow internet connection and already have 99% of a file downloaded and the connection drops all you need to do is download the missing piece instead of re-downloading the entire file.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s time to tweak our application â€” version 2.0.</p>

<p>Your application now conceptually splits up each file into <strong>pieces</strong>. Each piece has the same size. The protocol now uses the following operations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can tell the entire swarm which <strong>pieces</strong> we have already downloaded.</li>
  <li>We can send/receive a <strong>piece</strong> for a given connection.</li>
</ol>

<p>Picking the piece size actually has an important trade off. As piece size decreases, there are more announces and more file send/receive connections. If your piece size is too low (or too high!), the protocol loses efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-swarm">Growing the Swarm</h3>

<p>Initially, we embedded a list of possible clients in our application. This isnâ€™t the most practical: IP addresses change, organizing teams grow, people want to download the file from multiple devices, etc.</p>

<p>We could develop a centralized <strong>tracker</strong> of peers. This service is responsible for tracking the IP addresses of swarm members, and for providing that list to clients. Our application would register with the tracker on startup and query for available peers. The tracker could periodically send out updates as the swarm changes to keep clients up to date.</p>

<p>This seems less than ideal given our initial goal of offloading as much work as possible and not needing to host anything. Feeling inspired from the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol up to this point, you might get curious and wonder if thereâ€™s a way to exchange swarm information peer-to-peer as well. In the real world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed hash tables</a> are generally used to accomplish this (eg. the BitTorrent protocol uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> system). These approaches all generally require some clients which are always online to bootstrap the search for swarm members, but it provides a way to de-centralize and distribute this work.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-trust-me">Do You Trust Me?</h3>

<p>Up till this point, weâ€™ve trusted all the members of our swarm to send the same files as the <strong>initial seed</strong>. But what if a malicious organizer decides to modify one of the images to make a meme and spreads it masquerading as the original? Alternatively, what if someoneâ€™s connection is flaky and weâ€™re not quite sure we got the right bytes for the image?</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve discussed a similar problem in the past when <a href="https://dominic.cr/2020/05/26/merkle_trees/">Verifying Data with Merkle Trees</a>. The core of solving that problem involved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum function</a> on our data and sharing the checksum so that others could verify they had the data we intended.</p>

<p>So we decide to try <strong>embedding a checksum with each file piece</strong> in our application alongside our file piece information. Our application can then verify that any piece received from another client matches the checksum! We can now add untrusted members to the swarm without worrying that they might tamper our file data!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-next-year">What About Next Year?</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ve now established a good conceptual protocol for sharing this type of content. But one part of it is still impractical: so much information is baked directly into the application! Organizers really like the application and would like to use it for other events.</p>

<p>The information we needed to coordinate this dance of file-sharing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The list of file pieces and their checksums.</li>
  <li>Any information we need to find other swarm members. As an example, this could be the URL for our tracker!</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were to put this information in a file and modify our application to accept these files, we could now re-use the protocol arbitrarily! This means our application could download and share multiple sources at once.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is exactly what a <code>.torrent</code> file contains (along with other data). These files are encoded using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">Bencode</a> format in order to allow flexibility and offer some size reduction. Everything youâ€™ve read in this post is actually used in the BitTorrent protocol: the process itself, file pieces, checksumming, and trackers (or trackerless via distributed hash tables). Our application is the equivalent to a BitTorrent client!</p>

<p><strong>Well done - we over-engineered a simple file-sharing problem and built BitTorrent from scratch.</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="aside-encouraging-good-behavior">Aside: Encouraging Good Behavior</h3>

<p>We didnâ€™t really cover a) how to select which clients we interact with and b) how to select which file pieces to get first, but these are both …</p></article></div></div>

August 30, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/ycombinator-zoom-foreign-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Minutes before Nitthin Chandran was set to present his startup to a powerful group of foreign investors, the power went out in his apartment in Bangalore. The timing couldn’t have been worse: power outages are par for the course in the city, where Chandran was presenting remotely via Zoom, but there was life-changing money on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chandran, the founder of <a href="https://www.medpiper.com/">MedPiper Technologies</a>, was pitching his Indian hospital-staffing startup for this year’s Demo Day. The two-day event is the culmination of Silicon Valley’s most well-known startup accelerator program, Y Combinator; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/these-are-the-top-y-combinator-companies-of-all-time-based-on-valuation/">notable program graduates</a> include Airbnb, Stripe, and DoorDash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes were high, so Chandran came prepared: his Y Combinator–appointed mentor had advised him to upgrade his internet speed and<strong> </strong>make ready multiple backup options for situations just like this one. Saved by a spare dongle he’d bought on sale at his local market, Chandran delivered his one-minute pitch to an unseen audience of high-powered investors and thousands of viewers, all from his apartment in Bangalore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of the blackout, Chandran kept his cool: “We practiced maybe 100 times before Demo Day.”</p>



<p>For the first time in its 15-year history, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/y-combinator-officially-shifts-its-next-accelerator-class-to-fully-remote-format/">Y Combinator went fully remote</a> with its famed startup accelerator program. With the coronavirus pandemic making travel and in-person meetings nearly impossible, everything from workshops to the all-important Demo Day went online. The remote experience may have flattened the in-person interactions that drive some of the tech industry’s biggest deals. But founders from non-Western markets say that attending Y Combinator remotely didn’t hinder their success — in fact, it helped. Internet connectivity issues aside, foreign founders say the first fully remote Y Combinator has put these companies on a more equal footing with their American counterparts.</p>

<p>In pre-pandemic times, founders accepted to Y Combinator were flown to San Francisco, where they spent three months developing their startups <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/02/12/y-combinator-demo-days-2019-san-francisco.html">before presenting to funders at Demo Day</a>. For non-American founders with operations outside the United States, this often meant spending a full financial quarter away from their teams and home markets to attend workshops and networking events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You talk to other international founders, and they’re like, Oh yeah, I spent most of YC on a plane,” said Iain Usiri, a Tanzanian founder whose startup <a href="https://www.ramani.io/">Ramani</a> presented at last week’s Demo Day. By going remote, “The biggest logistical problem is solved,” he said. “You’re on par with a U.S. founder who is in his home market.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, Usiri might’ve fretted over his outfit choice or physical gestures on Demo Day. “Personally, I do well on a stage,” he said. But this time, he and other founders in his class invested in backup internet, high-quality microphones, and new lighting, to ensure their Zoom presentations go as smoothly as possible. A remote presentation has its own anxieties: Usiri said he was so paranoid about power outages in his home in Tanzania, he had nightmares about it leading up to Demo Day. Nicolás López, co-founder of Justo, <a href="https://www.getjusto.com/">a Chilean food-delivery startup</a>, said he worried about competing with social media notifications and emails that might be popping up on investors’ screens during their demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But logging onto Y Combinator from the comfort of their home markets meant founders could maintain their startups while benefiting from Y Combinator’s coveted mentorships. “Between when we applied for Y Combinator in March and today, we grew our team from 10 to 95,” said López. “I don’t think we would have been able to do that if we had been in Palo Alto for the past three months.”</p>



<p>In Bangalore, MedPiper’s Chandran, who is building a database of verified doctors and nurses in India, was able to take in-person meetings during the period. He said he signed up to 40,000 medical professionals during his time with Y Combinator. “We don’t think we would have done even 60 to 70% of the sales which we were able to close [had we been away],” Chandran told <em>Rest of World.</em> “All these sales were done in person, walking into hospitals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paradoxically, the remote nature of this year’s Y Combinator meant more face time between founders and partners. “I was asking for office hours all the time, sometimes three meetings a week with partners,” Arthur Alvarenga, founder of Brazilian startup <a href="https://chatpay.com.br/">ChatPay</a> said. “Everyone was very available, and with Zoom, things moved faster. You could get on a call faster than going to campus to meet with them if we were in person.”</p>

<p>Crucially, the pandemic has forced investors to consider any and all investments remotely; it’s leveled the playing field. Alvarenga, based in Brazil, might’ve missed out on chances for in-person meetings. But on Zoom, he’s just as remote as a founder in Boston. Both current and former non-Western Y Combinator participants said that funders are now more willing to take meetings and close deals over Zoom, where they once might have required an in-person meeting. Foreign founders in this batch of Demo Day presenters said they walked away from the event with more than 100 interested investors — far more than they could muster in their local markets.</p>



<p>Thomas Hellman, professor of entrepreneurship and innovation at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, said that the remote nature of today’s business environment has changed investor behavior, perhaps to the benefit of non-American founders.<strong> </strong>“Investors who said they would never invest unless they met a person have now written checks to entrepreneurs without meeting them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a willingness to close deals over Zoom hasn’t changed some of the inherent challenges in raising money as a foreign startup. U.S.-based companies still constitute the majority of the Y Combinator batch: 39 of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">197 startups participated</a> from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Hellman said that, in lieu of organic meetings and face-to-face interactions, venture capital firms are likely to rely on their own referral networks, which he said are essentially frozen during the pandemic. “The biggest thing to look out for is how networks are going to retrench,” he said. “That could lead to more privileged entrepreneurs having access to capital.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a more remote-friendly environment, Hellmann said foreign startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/foreign-startup-founders-face-unique-struggles-to-break-funding-barrier/">still face higher barriers to raising funds</a>. Local companies may still have an advantage, even if it’s a smaller one. “Just because Zoom is making this more democratized, it doesn’t change the fact that some investors are just not going to understand your market or want to invest outside the United States,” said Alvarenga. “And that’s a root problem.”</p>



<p>But for the half a dozen founders from this summer’s batch of presenters who spoke with <em>Rest of World, </em>internet outages and Zoom presentations were minor inconveniences compared to their otherwise positive Y Combinator experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real value of YC is the network,” said Alvarenga. “The more quality people you put in, the better the network becomes.”</p>

			<p>The original Roman mile was 1000 paces (<em>milia passuum</em>), or 5000 feet. The modern mile was defined as 5280 feet under Queen Elizabeth at the end of the 16th century in order to reconcile multiple discordant measurement systems already in wide use. In particular, it was convenient to make it an even multiple of the sides of an acre, which since early medieval times was a rectangle 660 feet long and 66 feet wide. 660 divides neatly into 5280, eight ways, allowing a square mile (640 acres or a “section”) to be conveniently quartered three times over: into quarter sections (160 acres), sixteenth sections (40 acres), and finally the 10 acre squares (660 by 660 feet) that remain at the base of all US land surveys to this day.</p>

<p><em>Background: Many years ago, I became curious as to why, exactly, there are 5280 feet in a mile. The explanations I found online at the time weren’t very convincing. At the time I tried to make some fixes to parts of the puzzle in Wikipedia, but they frequently rejected as OR (original research). Eventually I wrote this article, since revised and updated several times. Since then, my “version” of things will occasionally drift to the #1 spot on Google or Bing, or both, when answering the specific question “why are there 5280 feet in a mile”. More often some SEO-optimized version will slip ahead, though it seems this article is holding steady in the top 3 or 4 at least. So hopefully pretty much everybody who cares about the details will find this. If you have any comments or questions (or corrections), please add to the comment section, I do (eventually) read all comments.<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>I have yet to find an answer to the question that’s as thorough and complete as this one is. But I must caution that this article isn’t really up to academic standards and contains a non-trivial amount of speculation. Caveat Emptor, what follows is my theory of how the mile ended up with 5280 feet.</em></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on this topic goes something like this: the mile was originally 5000 feet. It was changed to 5280 feet in Elizabethan times around the year 1600 (some point to 1592 and some to 1593) to accommodate the furlong, which was 660 feet. It was easier to fix the mile rather than the furlong for various reasons, hence, eight furlongs and 5280 feet in a mile.</p>
<p>That’s the standard story. It’ll be fleshed out with bells and whistles, including odd theories about horses etc, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>The problem with these versions is that they don’t explain why this collision between furlong and mile occurred around 1600, and not centuries before. It implies, therefore, that people suddenly woke up and realized, hey, wait a second, if there’s 660 feet in a furlong … and eight furlongs in a mile … but 5000 feet in a mile …. wait a second !?!</p>
<p>It somewhat implies that four-digit multiplication was invented ca 1600. Like a lot of rear-view-mirror takes on history, the “explanation” boils down to: “before time X people were stupid about topic Y, and at time Z they wizened up.”</p>
<p>Failing to find a good write-up of the origins, I’ve pieced together my own theory over the years. And it’s a fun one because the answer (or rather, hypothesis) is simply this: the number 5280 arises out of a collision between organized religion, the military, and taxation. Three powerful historical forces, to be sure, so the fourth pillar to modern society (rationality) obviously has to be the one to compromise!</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more: naked Greeks are involved, and Jesus, and Vikings. In that order.</p>
<p>Our story starts with the “original” mile, the Roman one (though there is indication the measurement is older still). The Romans were both practical and militant. Their mile was 1000 paces – a pace being a double step (left foot, right foot) by a soldier in full battle gear. That was a “<em>passus</em>“, and a mile was a “<em>milia passuum</em>“, hence the word “mile” (for “thousand”, as in the word <em>millennium)</em>.</p>
<p>If you are a runner or a hiker, you’ll know that we still remember this information in our convention of relating pedometers to miles: about 2000 steps to a mile. But we have forgotten that it’s not a “trick”, it’s the whole point. Language use changes back and forth over time, and today we’re more likely to use the word “step” rather than “pace”, hence, we can think of a mile as being defined as 2000 steps.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Romans had another convention, that you’ve probably heard of, which was to place stones next to their roads to mark the distance from Rome. Called “<em>milliarium</em>“, these stone obelisks were first erected along the Via Appia, where milestones dating as far back as the second century BC still survive. Naturally, quite a large number of these stones survived along roads throughout Europe, providing a natural reference point, explaining why their particular measure of a “foot” survives with high accuracy. The central stone in Rome, from which the phrase “all roads lead to Rome” derives, wasn’t erected until some two centuries later in 20 BC, but is since lost.</p>
<p>It’s worth injecting that the popular notion that Roman roads all had measures of the distance from Rome is a myth: only central Italy and a few exceptions were marked from central Rome, all other roads were measured from the nearest local significant center. The US’ attempt to replicate this myth with the Zero Mile marker in Washington, DC, in 1792 would have a similar destiny, influencing only measurements nearby. Instead a similar variation (measuring from something local and significant) lives on in the mile markers of the interstate highway system, where the numbering typically starts at either the southern or the western state line and increasing as you drive in the other direction.</p>
<p>Curiously, we know very little of the details of how the Roman army used the mile as a practical tool – not a single significant military treatise has survived from Roman times. The that has, the <em>Epitoma rei militaris,</em> is unfortunately not considered authoritative. Thus its claims cannot be checked against any other contemporary sources, which is particularly irksome since some of them appear highly dubious – such as stating that the army marched 20 miles in 5 summer hours at regular pace and 24 miles at double pace.</p>
<p>You can experiment yourself to realize that the miles per hour measure is practical for a human: casual walking is 2 mph, an easy walk is 3, swift walking is 4. The available number of hours in a day is similarly small, thus making the mental arithmetic simple.</p>
<p>Hence, 5000 feet to the mile, a general measure that survived throughout Europe as roadside reminders of the might of Rome.</p>
<p>Now, switching tracks, about the furlong. It means “a furrow long” (long as a furrow) and is a practical measure in an agrarian society: it is (approximately) the distance an oxen can plow without resting. That distance was standardized to be 40 “rods”, where a rod (or “pole”) is today defined as 5.5 yards (16.5 feet), though it was probably originally 20 feet (we’ll get back to all this).</p>
<p>An “acre” (which means “field”) was 40 rods long and 4 rods wide (4 rods was also called a “chain”, more on that below). An acre was thus the surface area that one man and a team of oxen could till in one day. It was long and narrow because of the development of the heavy plough around the end of the 10th century, which turned the soil over, revolutionizing agriculture in northern Europe where the clay-heavy soil (vs sandier south European soil) went from being a handicap to an asset, in fact contributing significantly to the eventual inversion of economic power in Europe from the south to the north.</p>
<p>At this point, if you’re paying close attention, you’ll see that not only do we have the decimal (base 10) concept in the “mile” (one thousand paces), but also in the acre: the proportions of the sides are exactly 10:1. That’s because “acre” dates back to “10 square chains”, or an area that’s one “chain” wide and ten long. A “chain” in turn is four rods. The word “chain” comes from how this convenient measurement tool was constructed. Organic materials (wood, rope) have obvious problems in retaining precise dimensions, despite efforts to wax or otherwise treat them. A marked improvement therefore came from carrying a set of thin metal rods, that eventually would be “chained” together. Most surveying in the United States was done in the 1700s and 1800s using a standardized 100-link chain of 66 feet in total length.</p>
<p>But this was a more modern innovation. Going much further back in history it seems likely the basic approach was instead to carry a long, thin, metal “rod” that was 16 feet long, seems likely to me that they were in parts. This is still today a common surveying tool – search Amazon for “surveyor rod” and you’ll find the modern version, now made of telescoping aluminum and generally 16 feet long. We’ll get back to why it was 16 feet (and not 10 or 20), and how it later on became 16.5.</p>
<p>This tradition of the furlong (ten chains) took root in England between the fall of Rome and the Norman conquest of 1066, along the aforementioned adoption of heavy ploughs. With the Normans came the re-introduction of the Roman definition of the foot as 12 inches. A reference foot was thusly carved into one of the pier bases of the new nave in St Paul’s cathedral in London in 1104 (by the son of a banker, interestingly enough).</p>
<p>The Saxon tradition of measuring land had been established in terms of rods, and as we alluded above, probably based on 20 “natural” feet – i.e. not Roman standard feet but “real” 9.8-inch feet. The number 20, of course, was the common “decimal” system prior to the invention of shoes (at which point you can’t see your toes). Also, the technique of counting to 20 with one hand may have been prevalent. Vestiges of base-20 remain, notably for our story, in Danish and French. For example, in French you say “soixante-dix” for 70 and in Danish you say …</p></div></div>

A lot has changed since I last published my post on handling long-running async tasks in Python using celery. Last time we used it to run a few async tasks to fetch data from some service which took around 1-5 minutes. You can read more about it in the post below.</p>

Although I will still use celery for these types of long-running tasks, there is a subset of tasks that are better handled inside the execution thread itself. Today we will discuss a way of handling such operations.</p>

<p>
To the people who know me, I switched to a new role which allowed me to write Node.js over a year ago and I have been working on it since then. During my time working and building APIs using it, I have started falling for the way in which Node handles Async behavior and long-running tasks.</p>
<p>
The idea is simple, if the task is waiting for some IO, we can run some other task in the mean-time. Only the part that needs it, will wait for it.</p><p>
I wanted to use the same concept in Python. Fortunately, in Python version <code>3.4</code>, they have introduced <code>asyncio</code> for the same purpose. In this post, we are going to talk a little about it and try to understand its importance.</p><p>
By the end of the post, you will be able to understand the importance of async functions and will be able to start using them into your codebase.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2><p>
I am using <code>Python 3.8</code> for this tutorial and you might want to use the same to run and try out the examples. You can try them <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">online as well</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-async-function-in-python">Basic async function in Python</h2><p>
This is how we write a basic async function in Python.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<p>
You have to start by importing the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
Async functions are defined just like a normal function, you just have to add the keyword, <code>async</code>. If you want to wait for the execution of some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines">coroutine</a>, you have to use the keyword, <code>await</code>.</p><p>
Finally, you can run the function using <code>asyncio.run</code> method.</p>
<blockquote>
Anytime you use the await keyword inside the async function, the thread will not move forward until we get a response from the called function.
</blockquote><p>
This simple implementation will not help you understand the advantage of using async functions. In the next section, we will talk about the time taken for the execution and there you will really start to see the difference.</p>
<h2 id="time-taken-for-the-full-execution">Time taken for the full execution</h2><p>
To understand the benefits of using <code>async</code> functions, we will compare the time taken to run the same code in <code>async</code> and <code>sync</code> behavior.</p><p>
Letâ€™s first write the async code.</p>

I have defined 4 different functions doing almost the same thing. Letâ€™s assume there is a long-running function called <code>async_sleep</code> which is doing some IO operation. For example: Fetching data from the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<code>asyncio.gather()</code> is used to run the tasks passed to it concurrently.
</blockquote><p>
The response after running this code is as follows.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>1.1852593421936035</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The function completes the execution somewhere between 1-2 seconds for every execution. (Ran it 5 times to check).</p><p>
Now letâ€™s try to run the <code>sync</code> version of the same code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>


<span>def</span> <span>sync_sleep</span><span>():</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 1: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 2: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 3: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span>


<span>def</span> <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"started func 4: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>))</span>
    <span>sync_sleep</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span>


<span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>func1</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func2</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func3</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>func4</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Completed after: {}"</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>start</span><span>))</span>

<span>main</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response that we got after executing this was:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>2</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>
<span>started</span> <span>func</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span> <span>5</span>
<span>Completed</span> <span>after</span><span>:</span> <span>4.168870687484741</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
This saved us <code>~3</code> seconds for executing 4 functions. Now if we wanted to run 10000 such functions, we would save ourselves <code>~2000</code> seconds/ i.e. <code>35-40</code> minutes.</p><p>
Thatâ€™s awesome, right.</p><p>
Even if we are just running 2-3 such functions in each iteration these small savings can be very important to provide better user experience to your customers.</p><p>
Now that we have understood the advantage of using <code>async</code> functions, we must know a few more things about it.</p>
<h2 id="order-of-execution-for-async-functions">Order of execution for async functions</h2><p>
We should understand that while running the functions in async mode, we donâ€™t really know about the order in which functions are executed. Letâ€™s understand the concept with an example.</p><p>
The functions will return as soon as the execution is completed.</p><p>
We can mock the different execution time by sleeping for a random time between 0 and 1 using, <code>random.randint(0, 10) * 0.1</code>.</p><p>
Here is the full code.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The response to the following code is,</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>0</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
<span>completed</span> <span>func</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span>

<h2 id="practical-usage">Practical Usage</h2><p>
After the release of Python 3.8, which moved the <code>asyncio.run()</code> method to stable API, you can start using it without any problem.</p><p>
The only issue with moving from a <code>synchronous</code> approach to an async one, is to change the way of thinking about the problems. You have to change the way you think about every little detail. Once you reach that point of thinking in terms of async functions, believe me, you will love it.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work-under-the-hood">How does it work under the hood?</h2><p>
Letâ€™s check the type of the async function.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>

<span># &lt;class 'coroutine'&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div><p>
So, the async function is of type <code>coroutine</code>.</p><p>
This <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coroutine-in-python/">GeeksForGeeks article</a> does a very good job of explaining coroutines.</p><p>
To sum up what they wrote in the post, <strong>subroutines</strong> are the set of instructions that have one entry point and are executed serially.</p><p>
On the other hand, <strong>Coroutines</strong> can suspend or give away the control to other Coroutines, allowing multiple tasks to run at the same time.</p><p>
Python uses this concept to allow async behavior.</p>
<h2 id="handling-timeout-in-async-functions">Handling timeout in async functions</h2><p>
It is necessary to have a timeout for waiting for the task to get completed. We are not supposed to wait forever for it to complete. <code>asyncio</code> also provided the ability to add a timeout to the async function so that you can skip the execution before its completion.</p><p>
A practical application of this can be a case when you are calling a third party API in your application and the third party itself is down. In that case, you donâ€™t want to wait for a long time.</p><p>
You can use the <code>timeout</code> method to solve your problem. See the code for example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>async_sleep</span><span>():</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Execution completed'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>main</span><span>():</span>
    <span>try</span><span>:</span>
        <span>await</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>wait_for</span><span>(</span><span>async_sleep</span><span>(),</span> <span>timeout</span><span>=</span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>except</span> <span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>TimeoutError</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'Timeout error'</span><span>)</span>

<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>main</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>
The async function will raise <code>TimeoutError</code> if the coroutine doesnâ€™t return before the given <code>timeout</code> is passed.</p><p>
Response after executing the above code is</p>
<p>

There are other awesome methods in the <code>asyncio</code> module.</p><p>
You can check them at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html">pythonâ€™s official website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>
If you want to provide a better and faster experience to your users, you can start using the <code>asyncio</code> module in your application. This will definitely help you find cases in which you can reduce the execution time of your API or whatever else that you are doing.</p><p>
Just forcing yourself to write in this way for a few months can yield big returns in the future.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<p>With the increased amount of time I’ve spent in my apartment over the last few months and my new found electronics hobby, I thought it’d be fun to try and automate my studio apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of the apartment (above) in all of it’s 450 square foot glory. </p>



<p>I spend most of my time in the area with my desk, bed, sofa, and television. So, it made sense to focus on making this area as comfortable and usable as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take note of the robotic vacuum cleaner, the standing fan, and the television. I use these devices daily, but more importantly, they all respond to IR signals.</p>



<p>Consequently, I knew if I could decode the signal their IR remotes were sending, I’d be able to create a circuit that could broadcast an identical signal thereby controlling the device. Additionally, with an Amazon Alexa integration, I’d conceivably be able to make all of these devices voice-controlled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Demo</h2>



<p>Here’s a brief demo of the finished project. If you’re interested in seeing the circuit, code, and other implementation details, read on! Not only can I control my TV through Alexa, but also my standing fan and my robot vacuum cleaner. </p>



<figure><p>

<p>Here’s a demo of the fan. Triggering the sleep timer command cycles through the different delay options until the 1, 2, and 4 hour options are all enabled. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, here’s a demo of the robot cleaner returning to the home station when the “dock” command is triggered. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<p>The first step was identifying the correct IR codes to send which was by far the most involved part of this project. I had seen some other examples online of people trying to reverse engineer the IR codes their remote controls were sending and they were getting back a single clear value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t so lucky. Any remote control key I pressed would give me a slew of possible signal codes – not just one discrete value. </p>



<p>So, in order to find the correct one, I’d press the button I was trying to decode a few times to build up a potential list of valid IR signals. Then, I’d programmatically loop through them slowly to try and identify which IR signal was actually triggering the device. </p>



<blockquote><p>Figuring out what IR encoding the signals were using was another time and research-intensive task.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s the schematic for the IR receiver:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9aIHnUoDInPSudNujmBCmDYByZtYpPrH8BlIoplioo65dvTrtOjfLCUuR3TtyPTuCDumUsERv2tS1FzRuXFZjUmZgkSg8sF2G2Sp0Mh9wuFjmTXxU3RdjseWvq0N9dgRimRriktr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The final circuit is rather simple – an ESP8266 (for WiFi capabilities), a PN2222 transistor, and two IR LEDs. You certainly don’t need 2 IR LEDs, but I wanted greater coverage in the apartment and I had some parts to spare. </p>



<p>You can easily find the parts on Amazon and they’re all just soldered to a spare piece of perfboard.</p>



<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyV0pAaK6x43Sfc4dHxRnqnMbKefIvrq3aYbgWemNlb22-Bc6VTeGZM-2RPrdC5DaH6xXPZEan9rVfp-V07plvFNwAiNoBELJK1SzJ2k0T7rxlg5dHMmCPN7r3NQhxNmpvs9HeLA" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Though it’s hard to tell in the photo, the two IR LEDs are angled slightly away from one another to increase coverage of the apartment. </p>

<blockquote><p>A few tips if you’re trying to replicate this yourself. </p><p>For a while, I was getting a lot of noise or absolutely no IR values back at all from the IR receiver. I realized that the ambient light was interfering with the IR receiver. So, the simplest solution was just to hide the circuit and the remote control under a blanket while trying to record IR signals to eliminate any noise from ambient light.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure to replace the placeholders in the following code. This code is meant for an ESP8266, but should also be compatible with an ESP32. &nbsp;There’s certainly cleaner ways of writing this code, but my focus was on creating a proof of concept. </p>







<blockquote><p>For the “clean up” and “dock” commands, I repeat the signal at regular intervals in the hopes that the robot vacuum cleaner is in the line of sight of the circuit at one of those time intervals. Unlike all of the other devices, the location of the robot isn’t static.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, I had a circuit that was capable of controlling the main devices in my apartment. The next step was the Alexa integration. </p>



<h2>Alexa Integration</h2>



<p>The first issue I ran into was how to establish a connection between the Alexa and the ESP8266. Both were on the same local network, but I couldn’t find a way of setting up Alexa to make a local web request. Initially, it seemed like configuring port forwarding on my router was the only option and I wasn’t too keen on doing that. </p>



<p>Eventually, after a bit more research, I realized that Alexa could talk to <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IFTTT</a> and that IFTTT had an <a href="http://adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruit</a> integration. This meant I could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a> protocol to pass commands from Alexa to my circuit through Adafruit.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The MQTT protocol, in essence, is a publisher/subscriber model often used by IoT devices. In this use case, Alexa would publish different messages (turn on tv, turn on fan, clean up) and the circuit would subscribe to Alexa’s broadcast and trigger the correct IR signal.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Tutorial</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in replicating this same flow, start off by <a href="http://io.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">creating a free Adafruit account.</a></p>



<p>Once you’re logged in, go to Feeds and create a new Feed. In my case, I titled it <code>smartStudio</code>.  This Feed will be a running list of all messages sent to this topic over the MQTT protocol. As you can see, a log of all the voice commands I’ve used in the last month appear in this Feed.</p>

<p>Click on <code>This</code> and select Amazon Alexa. Then, select the Alexa “say a specific phrase” integration.</p>



<blockquote><p>You’ll be asked to complete a small authorization flow if this is the first time you’re integrating these services.</p></blockquote>



<p>Now, whenever we say the phrase we define here, Alexa will trigger the “that” portion of your IFTTT integration.</p>

<p>Now, we can send a message to our Adafruit Feed with a custom payload, in this case <code>hbo</code>. All that’s remaining is to handle this case in the code and fire off the right IR signal.</p>



<p>Once you’ve created a few more triggers, your IFTTT dashboard should look something like this: </p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>Because the MQTT framework doesn’t guarantee delivery of a message, sometimes I would give Alexa a command, but the ESP8266 chip would never receive it. </p>



<p>It’s a fairly rare occurrence and since Adafruit doesn’t allow me to customize the quality of service settings for the MQTT implementation, there’s no immediate solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Some finishing touches</h2>



<p>Now, we’re on the home stretch. We’re able to issue a command to Alexa, which gets forwarded to IFTTT, then to Adafruit, and finally to my circuit which sends out the correct IR signal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final issue, however, was that even though saying “Alexa, trigger clean up” and having my robot vacuum cleaner spin up was pretty cool, I really disliked the sound of the robot bumping into everything as it cleaned. The noise is very noticeable in such a small apartment. </p>



<p>Eventually, I stumbled upon the “Routines” feature in the Amazon Alexa iOS app which allowed me to set up a few location-based triggers. </p>



<p>So, whenever I left my apartment, Alexa would trigger the “clean up” command. The robot would start up, and then 15 minutes later, Alexa would trigger the “dock” routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, my apartment would consistently stay clean and I wouldn’t have to hear the robot bumping around everywhere. Additionally,&nbsp; I added another routine that monitored my location to detect when I was heading back to my apartment and would preempt the cleaning with a “dock” command.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solving first world problems, I know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more useable experience, I’d also recommend enabling “follow up” mode (allows you to issue multiple commands at once) and “brief responses” on Alexa.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve had this installed for a couple months, I wanted to see how often I actually used it. After pulling the logs from Adafruit, I’ve used this over 800 times in this month alone [August 2020], an average of almost 30 times a day.</p>

    <h2>Good Software Engineers Are Rare</h2>
<p>Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, mastering the skills is not enough to become a good engineer. If it were, the good software engineer would be no rarer than the hardworking, motivated engineer. Having the essential hard/technical skills mastered is only the start. To become great, the software engineer must adopt a mindset that often operates in opposition to the philosophical structure of the western world.</p>
<h2>Software Products Are Unique</h2>
<p>My development as an engineer began outside of the software world. I studied electrical engineering where I spent countless hours of my life in the lab: designing circuits, prototyping on breadboards, acid bathing PCBs. All of these efforts led to a finished, permanent product. Whether it be a power supply I could plug my computer into, a multimeter, an antenna, or some mostly useless gadget, I always had something I could hold in my hands that gave me a sense of pride and satisfaction. Productive societal activity tends to operate similarly. There is the expectation of tangible end results, and the success of an activity or task is contingent on the end result. For example, there are few companies or teams that do not set KRs (key results) each quarter, half, year. Developing software products, peskily enough, is decidedly unlike this. A software product is ephemeral. It can't be held or touched. There is no definitive "end result" or "finished product". What's more, the work done is impermanent. These traits aren't just unique, they clash with many fundamental expectations about the way we believe work/productive activity should behave. Whether consciously or subconsciously all good software engineers have had to internalize some sort of framework to allow themselves to reckon with this cognitive dissonance.</p>
<h2>Look To The East</h2>
<p>So what must a software engineer do if they can't rely on societal norms of the west to help them build the skills, temperance, and mindset to become competent, productive, and successful? They must <a href="https://www.theculturium.com/hermann-hesse-the-journey-to-the-east/">look to the east</a>. The western concepts that the software engineer must cast aside are:</p>
<pre><code> attachment
 permanence
 duality
 reason
</code></pre>

<p>The philosophy of Zen Buddhism rejects these cornerstones of western life. So it is in the delightful riddles/stories that the Zen Buddhists call <a href="http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html">Koans</a> that we might look for answers. The following are three of my favourite Koans that have been helpful on my path to becoming that rare and golden, madly productive, madly exact engineer.</p>
<h2>Non-Attachment</h2>
<pre><code>"Kitano Gempo, Abbot of Eihei temple, was ninety-two years old when he passed away in the year 1933. He endeavored his whole life not to be attached to anything. As a wandering mendicant when he was twenty he happened to meet a traveler who smoked tobacco. As they walked together down a mountain road, they stopped under a tree to rest. The traveler offered Kitano a smoke, which he accepted, as he was very hungry at the time.

"How pleasant this smoking is," he commented. The other gave him an extra pipe and tobacco and they parted.

Kitano felt: "Such pleasant things may disturb meditation. Before this goes too far, I will stop now." So he threw the smoking outfit away.

When he was twenty-three years old he studied I-King, the most profound doctrine of the universe. It was winter at the time and he needed some heavy clothes. He wrote his teacher, who lived a hundred miles away, telling him of his need, and gave the letter to a traveler to deliver. Almost the whole winter passed and neither answer nor clothes arrived. So Kitano resorted to the prescience of I-King, which also teaches the art of divination, to determine whether or not his letter had miscarried. He found that this had been the case. A letter afterward from his teacher made no mention of clothes.

"If I perform such accurate determinative work with I-King, I may neglect my meditation," felt Kitano. So he gave up this marvelous teaching and never resorted to its powers again.

When he was twenty-eight he studied Chinese calligraphy and poetry. He grew so skillful in these arts that his teacher praised him. Kitano mused: "If I don't stop now, I'll be a poet, not a Zen teacher." So he never wrote another poem. "
</code></pre>

<p>In this koan, Kitano displays an ability that every software engineer should find enviable: a relentless non-attachment to all things outside of the pursuit of Zen. A software project is in constant flux. So is the state of tools, technology, and frameworks in the field. There is a serious lack of permanence in software development, and the best way to cope with that impermanence is to become a solid practitioner of non-attachment.</p>
<p>The inability for ICs to remain unattached to particular pieces of work completed, or particular technologies is probably one of the most common and detrimental problems software development teams encounter. Features that have had blood, sweat, and tears poured into them but do not serve a purpose fail to get removed, technologies invested in that end up being duds do not get replaced. All of this results in projects and companies suffering major setbacks. Ben Horowitz frames the problem well in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">The Hard Things about Hard Things</a>: "Early in my career as an engineer, I'd learned that all decisions were objective until the first line of code is written. After that, all decisions were emotional." The less attached a team of engineers is to their own work, the less emotional the decisions about a project will be. Good engineers are happy to delete their own code. A leaner code base is an easier codebase to work in. Good engineers are excited when a teammate finds a more robust, easier-to-work-with solution to the problem they have been working on. They don't create inertia and waste time by resisting switching to that solution, no matter how much work they have sunk into their own implementation. Good engineers are like Kitano.</p>
<h2>It Will Pass</h2>
<pre><code>A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling asleep. It's just horrible!"

"It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly.

A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!'

"It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.
</code></pre>

<p>Mmm, such a beautiful dialogue. Reading it quells the destructive flames of pride and ego that flare-up in my stomach whenever I am on a productive kick. Many engineers thrive off of the energy of this fire, but it can be dangerous if untempered. Engineers, it has been said, are natural optimists. Engineers are also, I will posit, naturally prideful. When they are assigned a project or ticket and are asked to estimate how long it will take, they almost certainly will imagine themselves at their most productive when making the estimate. This results in the unenlightened engineer wreaking no small havoc on the logistics of managing a project. No engineer is at their most productive at all times; the productive fervor of a great session is fickle. The engineers who assess their own skills and compare themselves to their colleagues as if they are, hurt themselves and their team. They stunt their growth (by believing they are already outperforming all their colleagues), are hard to manage, and are hard to work with.</p>
<p>Recently, while working on extending our application's backend to be accessible via a GraphQL API, I came across a few blogposts by an engineer named Marc-Andre Giroux. Clearly, a quite talented engineer, I noticed a neat little feature on his <a href="http://mgiroux.me/">site's homepage</a>. As a play on the 10x engineer motif, he describes himself as an "Nx platform interface engineer", the N flitting randomly between decimal numbers from 0 to 10. Marc-Andre is clearly a talented engineer, yet is zen enough to appreciate that he is not always in the state of ultra-productive. Admittedly, sometimes he is even less than 1x engineer. He understands "It will pass" and is most likely a factor in his success.</p>
<p>Avoiding overestimation of yourself is not the only lesson to be learned. This koan helps me to avoid taking productive times for granted. Understanding that quieter seas and lulls in productivity and focus may be just around the corner is good motivation to keep pushing for more while you are in the zone. Zen has taught me to never let a good session go to waste.</p>
<p>Finally, this koan helps me during the unproductive and unfocused times as well. I often experience a quite intense physical aching and pain during those hours where I can't seem to get any code written, or worse when I can only seem to produce poor, convoluted, messy solutions. Knowing that such a state is somewhat inevitable and that It Will Pass, is a medicative and constructive mindset to have.</p>
<h2>First There is a Mountain</h2>
<pre><code>At the first level on the path, he saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.

On the second level of the path, he saw that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers.

And at a third level, he saw once again mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.

<p>This koan is a description of the Zen student <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/#OveDua">overcoming dualism</a>. In Zen, the idea is called "Not Two". The student first sees the river as discrete from the mountains. The student then sees that …</p></div></div>

	<p>During my years as a software engineer, I got exposed to more and more
data-based projects where data engineering and model research were
major aspects of the system.</p>

<p>Over time, one main pattern became apparent: the functional programming
paradigm helps a lot when working with data-oriented systems.</p>

<p>For a regular data scientist or a data engineer, they will be quite familiar
with ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. However, not all data scientists
and data engineers are familiar with functional programming and its
benefits.</p>



<p>I’ll remind again, that according to Uncle Bob, 
the essence of functional programming is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variables in functional languages do not vary</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Functional programming is disciple imposed upon variable assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements that change the state of the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you can assign variables a new value, but existing values cannot change.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'b'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>
<span># or 
</span><span>my_var</span><span>[</span><span>'c'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'new_value'</span>

<span># GOOD
</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'value'</span><span>}</span>
<span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>my_var</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>=</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>)</span>

<span># or
</span><span>my_var</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>'c'</span><span>:</span> <span>'new_value'</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>using functions</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># BAD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>input_dict</span><span>[</span><span>'new_value'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'var'</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>

<span># GOOD
</span><span>def</span> <span>my_function</span><span>(</span><span>input_dict</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>dict</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>input_dict</span><span>,</span> <span>new_value</span><span>=</span><span>'var'</span><span>)</span>    

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has a few important implications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you receive value, you can be sure that it won’t change mid-processing because it was modified
 in another thread</li>
  <li>as a function caller, you can be sure that after calling the function passed in arguments
 haven’t changed and you can use them the same way before calling the function</li>
  <li>as a function writer, you can do whatever you want with the data, as long as you do not change
 the original value and return results in the new one</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, it reduces surprises and eases the cognitional context load of the programmer as
we do not  need to worry about the state of the entire program but just the 
local state (input)
of the function.</p>

<p>There is a common expectation that if you call the function with the same arguments, it will
return the same results. However, that is not always the case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>reading the same file, with the same filename, might produce a different result if the file was updated</li>
  <li>calling function that returns current time should return different time during each call</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>These edge cases usually creep in from the environment (boundaries with the environment) and a keen
functional practitioner could work around these by introducing Environment or Context
states but for practical purposes it is more work than it is worth.</p>

<p>The implications above often lead to code structure that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>x1</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x2</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>)</span>
<span>b3</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x1</span><span>,</span> <span>x2</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b3</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s easier to reason about the calls step-by-step as the context of each function call is
always limited.</p>

<p>As it usually happens, in data engineering data processing flows are often quite simple, and
the pipeline above looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>
<p>One missing, but quite important, piece of this puzzle is that the functions should be cohesive (
one responsibility) and loosely coupled. What does it mean to be loosely coupled?</p>

<p>Let’s compare these two examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>def</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>):</span>
    <span>#...
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>c</span>

<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>my_function_one</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>another_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>third_call</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>final_result</span> <span>=</span> <span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What will happen, if <em>we</em> do not need to call <code>another_call</code>? In the first case, we could remove it
from the <code>third_call</code> function, but that would break functionality for all the other
users of <code>third_call</code> function.</p>

<p>Clearly, the latter case is more loosely coupled, because we can just drop the <code>x = another_call(x)</code>
line, we will achieve our goals, and the code won’t be broken for the other users.</p>

<p>The other nice thing is that nested function calls build this mental complexity hierarchy that
becomes harder to follow with each function. You can’t really understand what each function does
without traversing the hierarchy up and investigating all the other calls.</p>



<p>Now, we now know how to write nice “functional” functions. What can we do with that?</p>

<p>In the examples above we had a pipeline that processed just a single value. In most of the cases,
we operate on the lists. Those lists can be anything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lists of lists</li>
  <li>lists of byte arrays</li>
  <li>lists of tuples that are made of other objects and other lists</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>but we usually get some kind of list first. In Python, it means a specific type of array-like collection
but in reality, we just need some kind of Iterable.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-map">Enter the map</h2>

<p>When we are processing a list of items, it is extremely easy to use the functions that we’ve defined
above to process the list using a <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>On Python, the call would look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>items</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>my_function_one</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>another_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>third_call</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="reduce-it">Reduce it</h2>

<p>What if we want to get a single value as a result? Functional programming toolset has 
this function called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce">reduce</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>functools</span> <span>import</span> <span>reduce</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>:</span> <span>c</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Actually, <code>reduce(lambda c, i: c + i, x)</code> is the same as
<code>reduce(operators.add, x)</code>. It is also equivalent to <code>sum(x)</code> on Python,
so the same above could be expressed as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is important to note here, that <code>lambda c, i: c + i</code> is a function
and could be replaced with anything. For example, calculating is not
that difficult either (but there are better ways):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>accumulate</span><span>(</span><span>cumulative</span><span>,</span> <span>current_item</span><span>):</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>cumulative</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>sum</span> <span>+</span> <span>current_item</span>

<span>#...
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>calculate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>accumulate</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>initial</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>average</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>/</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="composing-functions">Composing functions</h2>
<p>I’ve just used (introduced?) an extremely important concept in FP -  function composition. It deserves
a special mention.</p>

<p>In the part <code>reduce(accumulate, ...)</code> you can see that we are calling a function, that takes another
function as the argument. To be used inside <code>reduce</code> the <code>accumulate</code> function has to satisfy 
the same signature requirements (if such a thing exists in Python at all…) - it takes two arguments
and returns a single value. The first argument and the return value should be (preferably) of the same 
type.</p>

<p>Then, when the time comes, <code>reduce</code> will call our supplied function to accumulate the stream of values
into a single value (it will get <em>reduced</em>). 
For developers who know their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>, 
it is the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy pattern</a>.</p>

<p>We can use the same idea in our functions as well. For example, let’s say we are writing a 
function to normalize some input data, but we want to let our users choose if the text
should be processed uppercased or lowercased. We could implement that like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>noop</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span> <span># default function that does nothing
</span>    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>first_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>)</span>
<span>second_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>)</span>
<span>third_use</span> <span>=</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>"aaAA"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="factory-functions">Factory functions</h3>

<p>The version of the <code>clean_text</code> above can be unwieldy to use with <code>map</code> so it is often beneficial
to create a factory function, that creates the version of <code>clean_text</code> that has only a single
argument but you still get to choose which text processing function to use:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text_processor</span><span>=</span><span>noop</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
        <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text_processor</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>text</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is also a perfect way to create configurable functions.</p>

<h3 id="better-composition-examples">Better composition examples</h3>
<p>In the example above, we could move the text_processor to the pipeline itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so a better example would be a randomizing post-processing function, to augment 
text examples for your neural network. We will make this augment function configurable,
so the users of the function can choose the possible augmentations:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<span>def</span> <span>clean_text</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>text</span><span>[:</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>text</span>

<span>def</span> <span>augment</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>step</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>):</span>
        <span>augmentation</span> <span>=</span> <span>random</span><span>.</span><span>choice</span><span>(</span><span>augmentations</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>augmentation</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>step</span>

<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>clean_text</span><span>,</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
<span>items</span> <span>=</span> <span>map</span><span>(</span><span>augment</span><span>([</span><span>noop</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>lower</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>]),</span> <span>items</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Often, I get to see functions that look something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>some_big_function</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>z</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>"a"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>z</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>y</span> <span>in</span> <span>z</span><span>:</span>
            <span>i</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
            <span>counter</span> <span>+=</span> <span>y</span> <span>/</span> <span>i</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>counter</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>while the specific example above is not that bad because it is rather clear 
what’s happening just because it is ~10 lines long, I am not happy when I find

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasonmcintosh_facebooks-kenosha-guard-militia-event-was-activity-6705852062460084224-G5e9">posted the following note to my LinkedIn page</a> earlier today, where I also <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/29/facebook-kenosha-guard-455-times">linked to this Daring Fireball article</a>.</em></p>

<p>A note to my friends who still work at Facebook:</p>

<p>You are at the top of your career. The very fact of your job at Facebook demonstrates a level of technical acumen that would allow you to work anywhere you wish within the technology sector.</p>

<p>The time has come for you to take advantage of this. Your employer has become unworthy of your talent. Please quit. Work for a company doing literally anything else.</p>

<p>From promoting hateful conspiracy theories to favoring Trump’s re-election, <a href="https://fogknife.com/2019-05-23-i-read-ruined-by-design.html">Facebook’s drive for emotionally fueled “engagement” over all else</a> steals the light from our shared human future in order to enrich a handful of people.</p>

<p>I know that you do not identify as a white supremacist. Facebook, however, funnels most of your talent directly into growing and empowering white supremacy’s most significant technological ally in spreading hate.</p>

<p>I urge you to think of your own career prospects, as well. The peak of Facebook’s positive reputation already lay in the past. After this year, employers will justifiably assume that hiring someone from Facebook would risk bringing in a culture of division, deception, and algorithmically optimized racism.</p>

<p>Please, for your own sake, if not for the sake of the future: leave Facebook. Do it today, before it ruins you.</p>

        <p><span>How We Do It?</span>
        </p>

        <!-- step 1  -->
        <div>
          <p><span>Step 1</span>
          </p>
          <div>
            <p><span>Automated Product Research</span></p><p>AMZ Snagger was birthed from the perspective of an amazon dropshipper. After months of grinding it out, putting in 100hr weeks looking for winning products and being able to scale into a 6 figure store. We knew that product research was an issue and it needed to be simplified.</p>
            <p>No one believed it could be done but we always did. So we got to work and designed YOU a bot from the mind of an amazon dropshipper.</p>
            <p>We designed a proprietary algorithm that mines, scrapes, sorts and filters winning products for you on autopilot. So that you can focus on the other important aspects of your business.</p>
            <p>Now we want you to experience what we experienced: The redemption of our time!</p>
          </div>
          
        </div>
        <!-- step 2 -->
        <div>
          
          <div>
            <p><span>Sort Through Qualified Products</span></p><p>We designed the app to filter and weed out the diamonds in the rough. This has virtually never been done before, since we ourselves our dropshippers we knew exactly What the amazon dropshipping community wanted to experience.</p>
            <p> Sorting Options like: price, category, sellers on listings, buyBox Eligibility and the potential for profit</p>
            <p>The most exciting part of this all, is that you are able to download all of the Winning products that are profitable and export them as a CSV.</p>

August 30, 2020 | https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><em>This is part 1 of a series by the data visualization tool <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a> that explains log scales. Visit <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">part 2</a> or <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale3/">part 3</a>.</em></p>
<p>As promised <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-scatterplotlinechart">last week</a>, we have a closer look at the logarithmic scale this week. I won’t get into mathematical details to explain what a logarithm is – I won’t even explain when we should use log scales instead of linear scales. This and next week, I’ll explain what log scales can tell us.</p>
<p>We start slowly. Here’s a chart that’s not on a log scale –&nbsp;not yet:</p>
<hr>

<p>We will transform it to a chart with a log scale in a minute (in <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper</a>, it’s as easy as clicking on a checkbox). First, let’s learn some basics about log scales, to understand what they tell us:</p>
<h3 id="Log-scales-show-relative-values">Log scales show relative values</h3>
<p><strong>Log scales show relative values instead of absolute ones.</strong> Log scales don’t care that 101 minus 100 equals the same as 2 minus 1. Instead, they are concerned with percentages: the difference between 100 and 101 is a 1% increase, while the difference between 1 and 2 is a 100% increase. So on a log scale, the distance between 100 and 101 is roughly 1% of the distance between 1 and 2:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log6.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log6.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log6.png"></p>
<h3 id="The-same-distance-on-a-log-scale-shows-the-same-rate">The same distance on a log scale shows the same rate</h3>
<p>So what do same distances on a log scale show? They show the same percentage growth or decline. Imagine you eat candy for money and your business grows yearly by 100%. That means every year you eat twice as many candies than you ate the previous year.</p>
<p>In year zero, you start by eating <strong>1</strong> candy.</p>
<p>In the 1st year, you eat <strong>2</strong> candies. The year after that, you eat <strong>4</strong> candies. In the 3rd year, you eat <strong>8</strong> candies. By year 5, you eat <strong>32</strong> candies, and on your 25th anniversary, you would be eating <strong>33.5 million</strong> candies.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, a line chart plotting these numbers would go insanely high very quickly. On a log scale, each of these amounts takes up the same space, because, in each year, the number of candies <strong>grows at a fixed rate (100%)</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/img/full-180531_log1.png" data-src-thumb="/img/thumb-180531_log1.png" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/thumb-180531_log1.png"></p>
<h3 id="How-to-read-a-log-scaled-chart">How to read a log scaled chart</h3>
<p>Let’s see what that means for our chart. Here, the log scale can show us two things that the linear scale can’t show us: First, the <strong>drop of short-term arrivals in the Second World War</strong>. There wasn’t a stark drop in <em>absolute</em> numbers (that’s why we can’t see it in the chart up there), but it was a stark drop in <em>relative</em> numbers:</p>

<p><strong>How stark?</strong> Well, we know by now that the same unit on a log scale represents the same growth rate. Looking closer, we see that the drop during the Second World War is almost as “deep” as the growth afterward is “high”. In April 1942, only 40 people visited New Zealand. Three years earlier, there were 33 times as many tourists: 1,310 in total. It took ten years to get back to that number of 1,300 tourists (for April) – that’s the brown range in our chart. But the growth didn’t stop there. Within 32 years, the number of tourists in New Zealand grew again by 33 times and reached 45,700 tourists in 1984 – that’s the blue range.</p>
<p>The <strong>blue range has the same height as the brown range because both ranges represent a 33-fold increase</strong>; no matter their absolute values. So during the Second World War, the arrivals in New Zealand dropped almost by the same rate between 1939 and 1942 as they increased between 1952 and 1984. That’s something the log scale can tell us and the linear scale can’t.</p>
<p>The log scale also shows us something about the arrivals each season. We can see that the ups and downs get smaller over time. So we can conclude that <strong>seasonal increase and decrease of arrivals each year happened at a higher rate</strong> before the Second World War than after the Second World War, and at an even lower rate since approximately 1985.</p>

<p><em>Next week, we’ll explore magnitudes, and how log scales are ideal to show exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/">Visit the article here.</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is the most comprehensive guide to Captive Portal on the planet.</p><p>I’m going to show you how you can build your own Captive Portal Software for Hacking, Business Security, and Growth.</p><p>In short: if you want to leverage WiFi Captive Portals for improving your Business, you’ll love this guide.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p><note>Sharpen your Network Security skills with <b>rootsh3ll Labs</b>, right from your browser. Click to <a href="https://labs.rootsh3ll.com/?ref=" captive-portal-guide"="">start you first lab</a></note></p><p>Operating in an Enterprise, studying in a college or sitting in Starbucks, you must have encountered a login screen like this once.</p><p>You connect to the WiFi network and it greets with you a similar login screen. That page is called a captive portal.</p><p>But, what is a captive portal exactly, How does it work and how the system knows where the captive portal is?</p><p>These are all the questions you are going to uncover from this guide and take-away the knowledge to build your own captive portal for your company, institute etc and use it for fun and profit.</p><p>Technically speaking, an authentication screen is displayed when a wireless user is not authorized to access the network resources. The authentication page is called a captive portal login.</p><p>1. DNS Redirection<br>
2. Splash page</p><p>DNS redirection works as the simple DNS hijacking where all the user DNS requests are hijacked and resolved to the captive portal login page. But, after widespread use of HSTS header implementation, DNS redirection hits a low success ratio providing no better service to the users.</p><p>Whereas, a Splash Page works in a little different fashion. It also uses DNS redirections but, it responds to the requests acc. to the operating systems which trick the O.S in believing there is a captive portal login in place and forcing the O.S to automatically trigger the login page to the user.</p><p>When a client device is connected to the WiFi, If unauthorized to access the Internet, A screen automatically pops up to display the captive portal.</p><p>A Splash page not only bypasses HSTS implementations on most websites but also gives you the flexibility of showing O.S specific login pages.</p><div>

<p>The only difference in regular captive portal and splash page is that splash page pulls up the captive portal login page automatically. Whereas, the DNS redirection based method requires a user to manually open up a website.</p>
<p>Imagine if a user is using a mobile app only, how would a user know he needs to log in? If you are a hacker you will lose your victim because the device will automatically disconnect upon no Internet access. So, this leads us to the much better and flexible option for triggering captive portal login page, the Splash Screen.</p>
<p>As a business operator, you can show a different kind of services to different client devices, whereas as an attacker you can identify victim machine automatically and serve the payload accordingly. I’ll showcase its crux, and leave implementation upon your creativity and requirement.</p>

<h2>Different Client Behaviours</h2>
<p>Now comes the technical theory part of this guide. It is important for you to understand the theory behind a captive portal before diving into the practical aspect of it.<br>
<a href="#start-ap">Click here</a> to skip the theory and jump into action</p>
<h3>Basic Strategy behind portal detection</h3>
<p>Every operating system has its own different way of detecting Internet access.</p>
<p>The mechanism is this basically:</p>
<pre>GET/POST http://foo.com/bar.html
If bar.html == [expected content] &gt; Open Internet
If bar.html != [expected content] &gt; Captive Portal
If bar.html[status] != SUCCESS &gt; No Network
</pre>

<p>If a Captive Portal is not in place, the result will match the expected one and the OS will know that there is full access to the Internet.</p>
<p>If the URL returns a result other than the expected one, then the OS will detect that there is a Captive Portal in place and that it’s needed to proceed with authentication in order to get full access to the Internet: In this case, the OS will open the Splash Page automatically.</p>
<p>All client devices use the above-described strategy to find out if they are behind a captive portal, but the URL might vary depending on the specific model of smartphone, tablet, laptop and depending on the specific OS version. In the following, you can find the list of domains that are contacted by each model in order to detect the captive portal.</p>
<h3>Captive Portal Detection method by various Operating Systems</h3>
<h4>Android 4 – 9</h4>
<p>Android devices look for an HTTP 204 response for a file named generate_204 from the following domain.</p>
<pre><code>clients3.google.com
connectivitycheck.android.com
connectivitycheck.gstatic.com</code></pre>
<p>HTTP Status 204 means the file exists but, is empty. This lets Android know that the Internet is accessible. If the request receives HTTP Status 302 (temporary redirect) instead of HTTP 204, Android will follow the redirection URL to display the Captive Portal to the user.</p>
<p>In its nature, all the domains serve on HTTP and not HTTPS which makes the captive portal mechanism possible. Also, it allows an attacker to use the redirection to bypass security.</p>
<p>Unlike Apple Devices, Android is very fragmented acc. to the install base. Which leaves us with a wide variety of attack surface as an attacker. Have a look at the current install base of Android devices acc. to Google.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<h2>Apple’s secret “WISPr” request</h2>
<p>WISPr (pronounced “whisper”) or Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming used by every Apple device for captive portal detection. This technology allows users to roam between wireless internet service providers in a fashion similar to that which allows cell phone users to roam between carriers.</p>
<p>Another question is whether this is an attack vector. The answer is “probably yes”. There is more to the functionality than a simple HTTP request. If you look up the keyword “wispr” from the User-Agent string in apache logs, you’ll find out why.</p>
<p>The idea is that smart Wi-Fi portals will detect that this is a WISPr-supporting device, and send back a WISPr message in XML. This allows the iDevice(s) to then log in with cached credentials via another XML message. This means, for example, you might be able to grab somebody’s credentials with a properly configured Wi-Fi access-point.</p>
<p>When an iDevice connects to a Wi-Fi network, the first thing it does is make a request to the URL captive.apple.com or apple.com/test/success.html.</p>
<p>With iOS 7 onwards, Apple began to use the User Agent “<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport</strong>“, though it’s not as common as the URL method that Android and Windows uses.</p>
<p>The reason Apple does this is that you may be using an app other than the web browser. For example, the only thing you might be doing is syncing your e-mail. In such situations, no auto-redirection would work as no browser is in use and you would never see the portal page, and your app will mysteriously fail to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>Therefore, before your app has a chance to access the network, Apple does this for you. It sends out a request to the above URL. If the request gets redirected, then Apple knows there is a portal. It then launches a dialog box, containing Safari, to give you a chance to log in.</p>
<p>When reading apache logs (<b>/var/logs/apache2/access.log</b>) for apple devices, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre>10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET /hotspot-detect.html HTTP/1.0" 302 487 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"
10.0.0.194 - - [03/March/2019:14:14:22 +0530] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 2004 "-" "<strong>CaptiveNetworkSupport-346.50.1 wispr</strong>"</pre>
</div>
<h2 id="start-ap">Access Point Configuration</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo apt update</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo apt install hostapd dnsmasq apache2 -y</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<h4>Configure hostapd</h4>
<p>Create a directory for saved configuration files. Open Terminal and create a hostapd config file.</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi hostapd.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>hostapd.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>       # Desired Interface name
driver=nl80211
ssid=<span>Captive Portal</span>   # Desired AP name
hw_mode=g
channel=<span>6</span>
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
</pre>
<p>Make sure you edit the changes accordingly every time you perform an attack.</p>
<p>Operating Channel number can cause issues if not chosen properly.</p>
<h4>Configure dnsmasq</h4>
<pre><code>







<ul>







 	<li pf="$">vi dnsmasq.conf</li>







</ul>







</code></pre>
<p><file>dnsmasq.conf</file></p>
<pre>interface=<span>wlan0</span>   # Desired Interface name
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,255.255.255.0,12h
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1
server=8.8.8.8
log-queries
listen-address=127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Make sure to define proper interface in dnsmasq.conf file.</p>
<h4>Parameter Breakdown:</h4>
<pre><strong>dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.250,12h</strong>:  Client IP address will range from 10.0.0.10 to 10.0.0.250 and default lease time is 12 hours.
<strong>dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1</strong>:  3 is code for Default Gateway followed by IP of D.G i.e. 10.0.0.1
<strong>dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1</strong>:  6 for DNS Server followed by IP address</pre>
<p>Kill network-manager utility before running hostapd. Because when you start hostapd, network-manager tries to take control of the wireless device and put it into managed mode. whereas hostapd needs the card to be set to Master mode (Access Point mode). So, kill network-manager and other interfering processes before you begin</p>
<pre><code>







<ul>








 	<li pf="$">sudo killall network-manager wpa_supplicant dnsmasq</li>
















 	<li pf="$">sudo hostapd hostapd.conf</li>








</ul>







</code></pre>
<p>To allocate IP addresses to victims, run dnsmasq.<br>
Before that, set IP address for wlan0 interface to enable IP networking, so that dnsmasq can process the incoming requests and direct the traffic accordingly.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal for dnsmasq:</p>
<pre>ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1       # Set class-A IP address to wlan0
dnsmasq -C dnsmasq.conf -d    # -C: configuration file. -d: daemon (as a process) mode
</pre>
<p>as soon as victim connects you should see similar output for hostapd and dnsmasq Terminal windows:</p>
<p><file>[ <strong>hostapd</strong> ]</file></p>
<pre>Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 00:c0:ca:5a:34:b7 and ssid "rootsh3ll"
wlan0: interface state …</pre></div></div>

    <mytitle>Parsing: a timeline</mytitle>
    <version>Version 3.1</version>
    <datestamp>Revision 2, 23 October 2019</datestamp>
    <author>Jeffrey Kegler</author>
    
    <p>In India, Pannini creates an exact and complete description of
      the Sanskrit language, including pronunciation. Sanskrit could be
      recreated using nothing but Pannini's grammar.
      Pannini's grammar is
      probably the first formal system of any kind, predating Euclid.
      In the future, nothing like it will exist for any other natural language of
      significant size or corpus.
      By 2018,
      Pannini will be the object of serious study.
      But in the 1940's and 1950's Pannini will be almost unknown in
      the West.
      This means that Pannini will have no direct effect
      on the other events in this timeline.
    </p>
    
    <p>In her translator's note on an article on Babbage's
    computer, Ada Lovelace becomes the first person to
    clearly distinguish programming a computer (software)
    as a separate field from
    building the computer itself (hardware).<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    Ada is also the first to
    think of software in linguistic terms --
    she originates the idea that,
    in writing software,
    we communicate with the computer,
    and that the means that we use to do that is a "language".<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future
     use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may
     become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the
     purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have
     rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but
     the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are
     brought into more intimate and effective connexion with each other.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here "analysis" means the branch of mathematics that studies limits
    and continuous functions, and which includes calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>Andrey Markov introduces his
      <term>chains</term>
      -- a set of
      states with transitions between them.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      One offshoot of Markov's work will be what will
      come to be known as regular expressions.
      Markov uses his chains,
      not for parsing,
      but to deal with a problem in probability --
      does the law of large numbers require that events be
      independent?
      Indirectly, Markov is addressing the question 
      of the existence of free will.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>In 1913, Markov revisits his chains,
      applying them to the sequence of vowels and consonants
      in Pushkin's
      <cite>Eugene Onegin</cite><a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>.
      Again, Markov's interest is not in parsing.
      Nonetheless,
      this is an application to language
      of what later will be regarded
      as a parsing technique,
      and apparently for the first time in the West.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      publishes his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach will
      dominate American lingustics for
      over two decades.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bloomfield's "Postulates" defines a "language" as
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      [t]he totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that there is no reference in this definition to the usual view --
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
    </p>
    <p>
      This omission is not accidental.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Bloomfield excludes meaning from his definition of language
      because he wants linguistics to be taken
      seriously as science.
      Behaviorist thought is very influential at this
      time and behavorists believe that,
      while human behaviors can be observed and verified
      and therefore made the subject of science,
      mental states cannot be verified.
      Claiming to know what someone means
      by a word
      is claiming to read his mind.
      And "mind-reading" is not science.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emil Post defines and studies a formal rewriting system<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      using productions.
      With this, the process of rediscovering Pannini in the
      West begins.</p>
    
    <p>Alan Turing discovers the stack as part of his design of the
      ACE machine. This will be important in parsing because recursive parsing
      requires stacks. The importance of Turing's discovery is not noticed
      in 1945 and stacks will be rediscovered many times over the
      next two decades<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Claude Shannon publishes the foundation paper of information theory<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>.
      In this
      paper, Shannon models English using Andrey Markov's
      chains<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      The approach is similar to Markov's but the intent
      is different --
      Shannon's is a serious attempt at a contribution
      to parsing human languages.
    </p>
    
    <p>From 1949 to 1951 at the ETH Zurich, Heinz Rutishauser works on
      the design of what we will come to call a compiler<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>.
      Rutishauser's arithmetic expression parser
      does not honor precedence but it does allow nested parentheses.
      It is perhaps the first algorithm which can really be considered a
      parsing method.
      Rutishauser's compiler is never implemented.</p>
    
    <p>
      In the form of arithmetic expressions, operator expressions
      are the target of the first efforts at automatic parsing.
      We will not see this issue go away.
      Very informally<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>,
      we can say that
      an operator expression is an expression
      built up from operands
      and operators.
      It is expected that the operand might be another operator expression,
      so operator expressions raise the issue of recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archetypal examples of operator expressions are arithmetic expressions:
    </p><pre><tt>
         2+(3*4)
         13^2^-5*9/11
         1729-42*8675309
      </tt></pre>
    <p>
      In Western mathematics arithmetic expressions have been read
      according to traditional
      ideas of
      associativity and precedence:
    </p><ul>
      <li><tt>^</tt>
        is exponentiation.
        It right associates and has tightest<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
        precedence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiplication (<tt>*</tt>) and division (<tt>/</tt>) left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of exponentiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition ('+') and subtraction ('-') left associate.
        They have a precedence equal to each other
        and less tight than that of multiplication and division.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parentheses, when present, override the traditional
        associativity and precedence.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rutishauser's language
      is structured line-by-line,
      as will be all languages until LISP.
      No language until ALGOL will be truly block-structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line-by-line languages
      are parsed using string manipulations.
      A parsing theory is not helpful for describing these
      ad hoc string manipulations,
      so they don't give rise to one.
      The only logic in these early compilers that really deserves to be called
      a parsing method
      is that which tackles arithmetic expressions.
    </p>
    
    <p>During 1950, Corrado Boehm, also at the ETH Zurich,
      develops his own compiler.
      Rutishauser and Boehm are working at the same institution at the same
      time, but Boehm is unaware of Rutishauser's work until his own is
      complete.
      Boehm's is also the first self-compiling compiler -- it is written
      in its own language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Rutishauser, Boehm's language is line-by-line and
      parsed ad hoc, except for expressions. Boehm's expression parser
      <em>does</em>
      honor precedence, making it perhaps the first operator precedence
      parser<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>.
      In Norvell's taxonomy<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>,
      Boehm's algorithm inaugurates
      the
      <q>classic approach</q>
      to operator parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boehm's compiler also allows parentheses, but the two cannot
      be mixed -- an expression can either be parsed using precedence
      or have parentheses, but not both.
      Also like Rutishauser's, Boehm's compiler is never
      implemented<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Grace Hopper writes a linker-loader,
      and calls it a
      <term>compiler</term><a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>. Hopper seems to be the first
      person to use this term for a computer program.</p>
    
    <p>Hopper uses the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      in a meaning very close to one of its traditional senses:
      <q>to compose out of materials from other
        documents</q><a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>.
      Specifically, in 1952,
      subroutines were new,
      and automated programming
      (what we will come to call
      <q>compiling</q>)
      often is viewed as providing a interface
      for calling a collection of
      carefully chosen assembler subroutines<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>.
      Hopper's new
      program takes this subroutine calling
      one step further -- instead of calling the subroutines
      it expands them (or in Hopper's terms
      <q>compiles</q>
      them) into
      a single program.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hopper the term
      <term>compiler</term>
      will acquire a different meaning,
      one specific to the computer field.
      By 1956, programs like Hoppers will
      no longer be called
      <term>compilers</term><a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Kleene discovers regular languages<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>.
      Kleene does not use regular expression notation,
      but his regular languages are the idea behind
      it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Glennie discovers what Knuth will later
      call the first
      <q>real</q><a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>
      compiler.
      (By this Knuth will mean that
      AUTOCODE was actually implemented and used by someone to translate
      algebraic statements into machine language.)
      Glennie's AUTOCODE
      is very close to the machine -- just above machine language.
      It does not allow operator expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AUTOCODE is hard-to-use,
      and apparently sees little use by anybody but
      Glennie himself.
      Because
      Glennie works for the British atomic weapons projects his papers
      are routinely classified,</p></div>

<p><img data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1176" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c8iAON90hE8/X0u6DaURFlI/AAAAAAAAEzI/dENaZvr7StEWfYHQXURz4wBd_D_XA73bACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/multitenancy.png" width="640"></p>


<p>Multi-tenancy Application Deployment Architecture could be modeled in 4 broad ways:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</li>
	<li>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no right or wrong here. It's about choice and consequence that you should consider taking into your business context and constraints. In this post I intend to jot down a some key points to keep in mind for each of these multi-tenant architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Easiest to implement from development and deployment stand-point.</li>
		<li>Just automate the deployment infrastructure for every tenant for quick set-up.</li>
		<li>Most expensive of all the models from infrastructure cost stand-point.</li><li>Relatively longer deployment time for newer application versions, at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>More wastage from infrastructure resource utilization point of view.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:
			<ul><li>not holding user-request data</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Suitability:
		<ul>
			<li>This is the best way to begin your SAAS platform, for product-market fitment until stability and growth.</li>
			<li>When you provide SAAS as white-labelled product.</li>
			<li>When you deploy your SAAS product at client infrastructure, maybe for compliance reasons.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Challenges:
		<ul>
			<li>How do you optimize resources for cost?</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>The most complex beast of all the multi-tenancy architectures.</li>
		<li>Maximizing infra utilization every bit for maximum profitability.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customizations on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>

<h4>Separate Apps &amp; Shared Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A model where tenant specific configuration are tied to deployed instances, but all share a common database. The data isolation per client is achieved by prefixing database schema with tenant info.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You got many web-frameworks and web-plugins supporting this model of prefixing-queries with tenant specific data, to hit the right datasource. For example, <a href="https://github.com/influitive/apartment" target="_blank">apartment</a> (rails/ruby), <a href="https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant" target="_blank">multi-tenant</a> (laravel/php), springboot (java), etc.</li>
		<li>Relational database instances are expensive. It way pricier than your application instances and is not as disposable as your compute instances can are. You got to do a bit of forward looking into future for its capacity planning.</li>
		<li>When you are managing your database instance as a SaaS provider and want to optimize on the overall cost, often the easiest thing to do is use shared database.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you manage as volume of transactions&nbsp; and data increases? The relational database by its virtue is vertically scalable and not horizontally scalable. Now this means it could become a bottleneck sooner than you think as you onboard more and more tenants, depending on the volume of transactions and data.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
</div>
<h4>Shared Apps &amp; Separate Databases</h4>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>A request can hit any of the available application instance.</li>
		<li>Tenant specific configuration is got dynamically with every request.</li>
		<li>The application's statelessness criteria for scalability would mean:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>not holding user-request data</li>
			<li>not holding tenant's configuration</li>
			<li>not holding database-responses</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Challenges:&nbsp;</li>
		<ul>
			<li>How do you hit the right database dynamically on a per request basis? How do you do it optimally for latency? Think&nbsp; of Atlassian suite of products like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile" target="_blank">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket </a>etc.</li>
			<li>In case of SaaS apps that provides lot of customization on the UI, how do you get this tenant specific configuration optimally for latency? <a href="https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website" target="_blank">Wix eCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.in/tour/ecommerce-website" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul><p>Hope that helps you in your design choice for your SAAS architecture...</p>

                <p>At the moment Kubernetes is one of the most exciting technologies in the world of DevOps. Recently a lot of hype has formed around it for one simple reason, and this reason is the mighty containers.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-2.JPG" alt="Infrastructure"></p>
<p>Once upon a time, and it wasn't so long ago, we still ran applications on server hardware. We had a website that spins on a hardware server and a database that stores the website's state. Users visit the site, everything was cool, everything worked.</p>
<p>The website become successful and our company grows. Then the website becomes more and more complex and evolves into a platform with a <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/thoughts-on-microservices">bunch of services</a>.</p>
<p>Then along came virtual machines (VMs), and we could run multiple operating systems and applications on a single machine. This empowered company to run ten times or more server instances on a single server. But what if we could run even more server programs on a single server if we left behind the bulk of the VM's operating system? That would give us, even bigger cost savings and flexibility. And the containers came along.</p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DbqFymX.png" alt="How Docker was born"></p><p>Docker containers have been the de facto development standard for quite some time now, but interestingly enough, Docker is not a pioneer in the container world.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-3.JPG" alt="History"></p>
<p>Docker is based on namespaces and cgroups technologies (the first one provides isolation, the second one provides process grouping and resource limitation), so in terms of virtualization, it's not much different from LXC/OpenVZ which historically came first. Same native speed, same isolation methods based on Linux kernel machinery. However, at a higher level, it's a very different story. The highlight of Docker is that it allows you to deploy a fully virtual environment, run an application on it, and easily manage it.</p>
<p>Like a virtual machine, the Docker runs its processes in its own pre-configured operating system. However, all the docker processes run on a physical host server sharing the processors and available memory with all the other processes running in the host system. The approach used by the Docker is in the middle between running everything on the physical server and full virtualization offered by virtual machines. This approach is called <em>containerization</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/kubernetes-101/kubernetes-101-4.JPG" alt="Docker internals"></p>
<p>Starting with Linux containers, the excitement moved to Docker containers, while increasing the need for <em>container orchestration</em>.</p>
<p>Back to our story. At some point, the company has realized that the current server is not sufficient, no matter how big it is (vertical scaling). The history moves to the next phase — the company buys more servers and divides the load between them (horizontal scaling).</p>
<p>The IT team tasks are getting harder and harder. They need to bother harder with problems like updates, patches, monitoring, security, backups, durability, reliability, resiliency... which means pagerduty at 6 am on Sunday...</p>
<p>Cloud!</p>
<p>Cool, now all we have to worry about is application logic. But the complexity of the highly available distributed system didn't go anywhere — it's just moved to the complexity of orchestrating and connecting the infrastructure components. Deployments, service discovery, gateway configurations, monitoring, replication, consistency...</p>
<p>It was a short story as we have come to this day. Now we have a distributed system with a bunch of services inside a bunch of containers in the cloud.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p><em>Don't flatter yourself, even though I've been working with Kubernetes I only know the tip of the iceberg. So here will be not a deep dive, but rather a smooth flight over existing subsystems and concepts.</em></p>
<p>Kubernetes is a sophisticated mechanism designed to make systems scalable, resilient, and easy to deploy. It allows us to automate container orchestration — starting, scaling, managing containerized applications including cluster management, scheduling, service discovery, monitoring, secrets management, and more.</p>
<p>Kubernetes allows to automate the start and rollback of deployments, Kubernetes manages the resources and can scale the required resources for the applications depending on how much they need in order to avoid waste of resources. So k8s essentially is <strong>process automation</strong>. Applications in k8s are rolled out and tested without administrators. The developer writes a script and then the cloud magic happens. So, in the ideal world of Kubernetes, all operational support of the software lies on the shoulders of programmers, and administrators make sure that the layer of cloud infrastructure — that is, Kubernetes itself - works steadily. That's why companies go to the clouds to completely remove the routine of their administration and do only development.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the coolest features of Kubernetes is that it helps <strong>standardize the work with Cloud Service Provider</strong>. No matter which CSP we are talking about, working with Kubernetes always looks the same. The developer, in a <strong>declarative manner</strong>, tells the Kubernetes what he needs, and Kubernetes works with system resources, helping the developer to abstract from the implementation details of the platform.</p>
<p>Originally, Kubernetes was a Google project that took into account the shortcomings of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43438/">Borg</a>, the ancestor of Kubernetes. Google uses Kubernetes to manage its gigantic infrastructure of millions of containers. At some point, Google gave the Kubernetes to the world, namely the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. So far, Docker has added the Kubernetes as one of the orchestrators — Kubernetes is now part of the Docker Community and Docker Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has many names among which are <em>kube</em> or <em>k8s</em> (I like cool acronyms with numbers and will use it further).</p>
<p>The Kubernetes itself is one huge piece of abstraction. These abstractions are mapped to virtual or physical infrastructure. To understand how it works, we must first understand its basic components.</p>
<h3>Pod</h3>
<p>The pod is the smallest unit that can be launched on a cluster node. It is a group of containers that should work together for some reason. The containers in the pod share port numbers, Linux kernel namespaces, and network stack settings. So when you scale your application within k8s, you should increase the number of pods rather than the number of containers in one particular pod. By <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy">default</a> containers inside pods are restarted automatically fixing intermittent problems for you. So even on these basic level k8s keeps your containers running and with a little additional effort, you can tune it to get even more reliability.</p>
<p>Quite often (but not always) there is only one container underneath the pod. But pod abstraction provides additional flexibility when, for example, two containers need to share the same data warehouse, or if there is a connection between them using interprocess communication, or if they are closely connected for some other reason, all this can be implemented by running them in the same pod.</p>
<p>Thus, you can easily draw parallels with existing code primitives and distributed primitives in k8s. Class is a container image, an object is a container instance, a pod is a deployment unit, the composition can be achieved via sidecar pattern, etc.</p>
<p>Another flexibility of pods is that they do not require the use of Docker containers. If necessary, you can also use other application containerization technologies, such as <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/">rkt</a>.</p>
<h3>Desired state</h3>
<p>The desired state is one of the basic concepts of k8s. You can specify the required state of running pods instead of writing how to achieve that state. For example, if a pod stops working for some reason, k8s will recreate the pod based on the specified desired state.</p>
<p>K8s always checks the state of the containers in the cluster, and this is done by the control loops on the so-called Kubernetes Master, which is part of the control plane. We'll talk about it a bit later.</p>
<h3>Objects in Kubernetes</h3>
<p>An object in k8s is a record of intent — the desired cluster state. And after the object is created, the k8s will constantly check for this object state. In addition, the objects also serve as an additional abstraction layer above the container interface. You can interact with the objects' entities instead of interacting directly with containers.</p>
<p>Almost every k8s object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object spec and the object status.</p>
<p><strong>Pod</strong> that we talked about earlier is just one of the k8s objects.</p>
<p>Pods are mortal — they are born and die but in order to be able to communicate with pods and for them to be able to communicate with each other abstraction of the <strong>Service</strong> has been introduced. Service plays the role of an access point to sets of pods that provide the same functionality as the underlying pods. There are different types of services, ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName. By default k8s use ClusterIP — it exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP, so you can only access it using the Kubernetes proxy.</p>
<p>Also for exposing services you can use <strong>Ingress</strong> object. Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as an entry point for your cluster. Ingress is a description of how traffic should flow from outside the cluster to your services, it acts as a "smart router" or ALB. It allows you to consolidate routing rules into a single resource, as it can aggregate multiple services under a single IP address.</p>
<p>For example, the web application can have a home page at <a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com</a> and a shopping cart at <a href="https://example.com/cart">https://example.com/cart</a> and an API at <a href="https://example.com/api">https://example.com/api</a>. We could implement all of them in one pod, but in order for all of them to scale independently, we could decouple them into different pods and connect to Ingress.</p>
<p>K8s also has a huge number of controllers, such as <strong>ReplicaSet</strong> — it checks that a certain number of copies of pods are running, <strong>StatefulSet</strong> is used with stateful applications and distributed systems, <strong>DemonSet</strong> is used to copy pods to all nodes in the cluster or only to specified nodes, etc. They all implement a control loop — a non-terminating loop that monitors the state of its subsystems, then makes or requests …</p></div></div>

        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I do a fair amount of interviews, 60+ during the six months prior to COVID and during those I have noticed some common mistakes candidates make during the interview that are highly avoidable, so I thought I’d spend just a little bit of time writing those down and share them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1---not-asking-clarification-questions">#1 - Not Asking Clarification Questions</h3>
<p>Normally all tech companies make candidates go through at least one round of technical interview, where a problem is presented and the candidate needs to address it and solve it. This interviews can vary in form, ie. coding challenges where the candidate needs to do hands-on coding, architectural interviews where the candidate would need to design some “bigger” system and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of technical question you may be asked, it is very important to ask clarifying questions <strong>always</strong>. And I can’t stress enought the <strong>always</strong> here, even if you think the problem given is trivial, it is not, take a bit of time to think about it and questions will pop up in your mind. For instance, if I asked you during an coding interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<em>given a list of numbers, return two numbers such that one times the other results in 220</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think that this two-sentence problem is very clear. However questions that I would ask are “<em>is the list sorted</em>…<em>are the numbers unique</em>…<em>can I multiply a number to itself</em>…<em>what shall I return if there are multiple numbers meeting the criteria</em>”.</p>
<p>Asking clarifying questions is however not only important for you to provide the best solution possible. It is also important because it is what I would expect you to do in real life when coming in to my team and you’re given a problem to solve. I would expect you to ask questions to further scope the problem, discover corner cases, etc. and not just go back to your desk and start coding.</p>
<p>I normally tell candidates upfront “<em>feel free to ask any question that helps you clarify</em>”. If you are given that cue, it is because it is important for the process. Stop, think, and ask the questions that will surely pop up.</p>
<h3 id="2---not-keeping-your-interviewer-engaged">#2 - Not keeping your interviewer engaged</h3>
<p>There was a time where I found this sentence just be BS. I thought that the interview process was just about me solving or answering questions. I was dead wrong. Any good interview process is a two-way street, a process where the interviewer and the candidate <strong>collaborate</strong> during however long the interview is. And because they are collaborating, it is very important to keep the other party engaged.</p>
<p>“<em>How do I keep my interviewer engaged?</em>” you may ask. It is extremely simple, just <strong>think out loud</strong>, let the interviewer know how and where your thoughts are taking you. I know this can feel odd, or you may fear saying anything stupid, don’t. There is literally nothing you may say that would be interpreted as stupid.</p>
<p>Thinking out loud during an problem solving interview has several advantages in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>the obvious, you keep your interviewer engaged. We are all humans and it is very easy for us to let our mind wander off for a moment if the candidate is just silent while e.g. coding for 30 minutes. And as unfair as it might sound, an interviewer not paying attention, does not play on your side</li>
<li>the less obvious, it gives you more time. There are numerous instances where candidates that I interviewed just go silent during their coding or their architectural challenge and after a few minutes they just come with the solution. At that point I have lots of questions about the trade-offs they made, why they made them etc. Many of those questions could have been avoided by just walking me through that thought process, and that saves time that might be especially important when the solution is not completely correct.</li>
<li>the none obvious at all. <strong>Good interviewers are there to help you</strong>. Believe me, all good interviewers I know <strong>want the candidate to pass the interview</strong> and will do whatever possible (and within their limits) to help you succeed. So giving them early feedback on why/what/how you’re doing what you’re doing let them help you as soon as possible. For example, if I see that they path you’re taking will get you to a very bad solution, I will try to  ask subtle questions to make you to re-think about your current proposal and other possible trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3---not-prepare-for-the-interview">#3 - Not prepare for the interview</h3>
<p>This mistake may seem very hard to make, right? Who comes to an interview for a tech company not having done tons of leetcode problems, studying algorithms and data structures to the limit?
Well, this is one side of the preparation, the other one however is not so obvious.</p>
<p>Most tech companies have rounds of behavioral interviews and although these may or may not involve certain technical (very high level) questions, you also need to prepare for these. These kinds of interviews are more like an open discussion where you will be asked things related to your previous projects, your background, certain situations you faced in the past and how you approached them, interactions with your team mates, how have you led projects (if applicable), etc. And for all these, it is better to come prepared.</p>
<p>When I say prepared, I don’t mean that you invent, or “fake” the answers to these types of questions, believe me when I tell you that it is relatively easy to know when any of that is true with just two-three follow up questions.
What I mean when I say prepare is that you should spend some time thinking about those kinds of past situations, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>that time you led that project that was slipping the deadline, how did you approach that? what did you do? what was the outcome? what did you learn?</li>
<li>that time you were given not so good feedback by some of your peers, think about what you learnt, how you felt, how you dealt with that and what changed moving forward</li>
<li>that time you had to give feedback to some of your peers that was hard for you to give, think about how you did it, would you do it in the same way today? how do you think it went now in retrospect?</li>
<li>that time you were given a problem that required more broader knowledge than what you had at that moment, what did you do? how did you deliver/ did you enjoy the challenge or was it stressful?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>I see this preparation as going back to your past memories and reflect on them. This will help during the interview as your thoughts will be already in order and you will not have to pause for minutes to think about what to say, you will just know what past experience is most relevant for that moment, believe me.</p>
<p>It is also very important to remember, be <strong>completely honest</strong>. In these kinds of interviews there is no right or wrong answer, we are just trying to get to know you a bit better, your motives and motivations, where you excel and where there is still potential improvement, etc. All this helps you and the hiring manager have a good start on your first day at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>An interesting mistake with Go's <code>context</code> package that I (sort of) made</h2>

	<p><small>August 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Today, <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/">Dave Cheney</a> did another Go pop quiz
<a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/1299846267850223616">on Twitter</a>,
where he asked whether the following code printed -6, 0, '&lt;nil&gt;', or
paniced:</p>

<blockquote><pre>package main
</pre>

<pre>import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)

func f(ctx context.Context) {
    context.WithValue(ctx, "foo", -6)
}

func main() {
    ctx := context.TODO()
    f(ctx)
    fmt.Println(ctx.Value("foo"))
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't answer this correctly because I focused my attention on the
wrong thing.</p>

<p>What I focused on was the use of the <code>"foo"</code> string as the context
key, partly because of my experience with languages like Python.
To start with, the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/context/"><code>context</code></a>
package's documentation says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The provided key must be comparable and should not be of type string
or any other built-in type to avoid collisions between packages using
context. Users of WithValue should define their own types for keys.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A traditional problem in languages like Python is that two strings
may compare the same without actually being the same thing, and
some code really wants you to present it with the exact same thing.
However, the <code>context</code> package doesn't require that you present it
with the exact same key, just a key where the <em>interface value</em> of
the key will compare the same.</p>

<p>(Because <code>context</code> compares interface values, both the value and
the type must match; it's not enough for both values to have the
same underlying concrete type, say string, and to compare identical.
This is why defining your own string type is a reliable away around
collisions between packages.)</p>

<p>So after I worked through all of this, I confidently answered that
this code printed -6. The <code>"foo"</code> string that the value is set
with is not necessarily the same <code>"foo"</code> string that it's retrieved
with, but that doesn't matter. However, this is not the problem
with the code. The actual problem is that <strong>context.WithValue()
returns a new context with the value set, it doesn't change the
context it's called on</strong>. Dave Cheney's code is written as if
<code>.WithValue()</code> mutates the current context, as <code>f()</code> ignores that
new context that <code>.WithValue()</code> provides and returns nothing to
<code>main()</code>. Since the original <code>context</code> in <code>main()</code> is what <code>.Value()</code>
is called on, it has no <code>"foo"</code> key and the result is actually
'&lt;nil&gt;'.</p>

<p>This problem with the code is actually a quite interesting mistake,
because as far as I can tell right now none of the usual Go style
checkers detect it. This code passes '<code>go vet</code>', it produces no
complaints from <a href="https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck"><code>errcheck</code></a>
because we're not ignoring an error return value, and tools like
<a href="https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint">golangci-lint</a> only
complain about the use of the built-in type string as the key in
<code>.WithValue()</code>. Nothing seems to notice that we're ignoring the
critical return value from <code>.WithValue()</code>, which turns it into more
or less a no-op.</p>

<p>(Now that Dave Cheney has brought this to the surface, I suspect
that someone will contribute a check for it to <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">staticcheck</a>, which already detects the 'using a
built-in type as a key' issue.)</p>

It includes a whole spectrum of conditions, from tendonitis of the hand or wrist to carpal tunnel syndrome to cubital tunnel syndrome. Basically, if your hands or wrists hurt or go numb or tingle, that may be RSI. If these symptoms are associated with repetitive tasks, such as typing at a computer, it is almost certainly RSI. (Note that such symptoms do sometimes go away within a few minutes, hours, days, or weeks.) Other symptoms include losing strength or coordination in your hands, or perhaps dropping things.</p> <p>Not everyone experiences all symptoms, and sometimes your symptoms may not occur until several hours or even days after the activity which causes them. (Have you ever hiked a long way and not been really sore until the next day or even two days later?) Some people, especially at UHS, call RSIs Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs); it's the same thing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>RSI seems to have many causes. Everyone's RSI is different. The cause can be equipment, but contributing factors can be broader (overall body health like sleep/head/neck/back posture factors, psychological factors). Sometimes you might have RSI symptoms, but it might actually NOT be RSI!</li> <li>Pronating wrists (turning face down) is bad - therefore the default mouse and keyboard alignment is bad! 😱</li> <li>Tilting wrists up is bad - the normal up-sloping keyboard is bad. It should be exactly the opposite: <img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/85174576-31ebac80-b2a8-11ea-913d-5efdfc4fb9e7.png"> </li> <li>Arm posture/lumbar/upper back support is important.</li> <li>Constant pressure in one position is a cause - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4482445">vary it up</a> and take frequent breaks</li> <li>Long key travel (up/down) is bad.</li> <li>Long key travel (sideways) is bad therefore QWERTY is bad.</li> <li>Multiple pressure at the same time is bad, therefore Ctrl+C/S/V with one hand is bad.</li> <li>Sometimes the cause is <strong>psychosomatic</strong> - subconscious stress.</li> <li>Exercise helps sometimes - pushups, pullups, dips, and situps.

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="sapper"> <div>  <main> <div>  <p>My entire worldview changed when I realized that <strong>luck can be created</strong>.</p> <p>More precisely, you can actively <strong>create optimal conditions for lucky things to happen to you</strong>. The more I looked into this, the more I realized that this is not only <em>not</em> a new insight, but successful people have studied this for <em>decades</em> and I am just late to the party.</p> <p>In this post we'll briefly review the "Literature of Luck", and then I'll end with some personal thoughts on how it could be extended.</p> <section> <h2 id="binary-luck">Binary Luck</h2> <p>Most people have a binary view of luck:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kgd335km9x3ujfmhxnz7.png"> </p> <p>This is true enough. Some people are born into privilege, some people just win some literal or figurative lottery or other.</p> <p>The closing question of every episode of Guy Raz's <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a> podcast asks successful people: <em>"How much of your success is due to skill, and how much is due to luck?"</em></p> <p>Those who believe in their own agency answer the former. Others - who've seen people smarter and harder working than them fail - answer the latter. Those who are politically correct cop-out with the half-and-half.</p> <p>It can be comforting to subscribe to the binary luck model. If you just got a bad roll of the dice, there's nothing you could do. Your lack of success is not your fault.</p> <p>But what if I told you <strong>there are people who have skill at creating luck</strong> for themselves?</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</h2> <p>Jason Roberts coined the term "<a href="https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area">Luck Surface Area</a>", and it was expanded by <a href="https://www.skmurphy.com/blog/2019/04/03/increase-your-luck-surface-area-to-get-more-customers/">Sean Murphy</a> and popularized by <a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Patrick McKenzie</a>.</p> <p>I liken this model of luckiness to a "catchment area" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchment_area">a term from urban and hydrological geography</a>). Luck is still randomly occurring, but you can position yourself in a way that captures more of it:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ogbkk8weenqb9nltrl34.png"> </p> <p>Jason has a really simple model of how to grow your LSA - do more things, and tell more people about it. <strong>Doing and Telling</strong>. Already this embodies a more active attitude toward how you can orient your life for more positive random events. It's "<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs Growth mindset</a>" adapted for luck.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="four-kinds-of-luck">Four Kinds of Luck</h2> <p>A parallel, older school of thought dates back to James Austin in 1978 and was repopularized by <a href="https://pmarchive.com/luck_and_the_entrepreneur.html">Marc Andreesen</a> in 2007, then <a href="https://twitter.com/nivi/status/1094940675353784320?lang=en">Naval and Nivi</a> a decade later.</p> <p>Here, there are no helpful visuals. James Austin just gives a list of types, and Marc quotes verbatim. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1093981014920052736">Naval summarizes</a> the 4 kinds of luck as such:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li> <p>Hope luck finds you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hustle until you stumble into it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.</p> </li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>I've quoted this many times to friends and always had trouble remembering what the 4 types are. I gave it some thought and visualized/organized it as such:</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5ycsicfgoxsvxoyys5ip.png"> </p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>🌱 Accidental Luck</strong>: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it's seed lands. It's not very interesting since by definition you can't do anything about it, but ofc privilege plays a huge part.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck</strong>: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There's no particular direction in mind, but you're more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope. You're more likely to roll a 6 if you roll more dice.</p> <blockquote> <p><a href="https://due.com/blog/keep-going-charles-f-kettering/">"I have never heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down." - Charles Kettering</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>💊 Prepared Luck</strong>: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss. The canonical story on this is Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, which was a huge medical breakthrough. The discovery was a total accident, but Fleming was not only "uniquely equipped to observe it" by his background, he took action to confirm the hypothesis.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Chance favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>"Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”" - <a href="http://themattheweffect.org/tag/richard-feynman/">Gian-Carlo Rota</a></p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p><strong>🧲 Magnetic Luck</strong>: <em>"Chance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and how you behave."</em> All sources call it "individualized action" but I've renamed it "magnetic luck" to emphasize the end result rather than how you get there. I'm quite familiar with this as <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears/#miner">the "Miner" gear of my Learning Gears</a> terminology (since updated to 4 gears in <a href="https://learninpublic.org/">my book</a>). This was already a thing pre-Internet, but search and social media have given tremendous reach and influence to the oddballs and obsessives that become the spiritual leaders of every idea and purpose both big and niche.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I find the 4 of these hard to remember, so I've organized them along two axes - <strong>active vs passive</strong>, and <strong>general vs individual</strong>. The first axis is the same realization as "Luck Surface Area" - you actually have the power to do things to create more luck than you were given.</p> <p>The second axis is the insight - that there are forms of luck that apply to everyone, and there are forms of luck that are available only to someone in your unique position. There is a you-shaped hole in the universe and you can either passively occupy it or you can become a beacon for some idea or purpose.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="habits-and-strategy">Habits and Strategy</h2> <p>I of course find the Four Kinds of Luck very appealing, since I've quoted it so much to friends that I'm writing this post at all. But upon closer reading I think there's a <em>slightly</em> different direction that is unaddressed by the Four Kinds (I originally thought this was embedded in the Four Kinds, only to discover that it wasn't in the source material and I had completely read my own thinking into it).</p> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/poue5zg9homy1eo4ml05.png"> </p> <p>This model differs in two ways. It treats both axes as a spectrum rather than a 2x2. It also focuses more on <strong>actions</strong> (you can take) rather than <strong>classification</strong> (which are a little more abstract). I've also swapped out "Active vs Passive" for "Active Habits" and "Individual vs General" for "Good Strategy".</p> <p>I've written about a few of these ideas in prior posts so I won't elaborate:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">Claiming a Domain, Personal Branding</a></li> <li>"Copywork" I wrote about in the "Clone Open Source Apps" chapter of the book</li> </ul> <p>I think <strong>Exploring</strong> and <strong>Prospecting</strong> are worth elaborating here.</p> <p><strong>Exploring</strong> (and to a lesser extent Grinding and Copywork) are <strong>Actively Habitual, non Strategic</strong> activities. But this doesn't mean it is bad. I think this is what you do when you take in general life and career advice and apply them to yourself. You know there are a list of <strong>Principles</strong> which are just generally good things to do in life, and trust that you will do well if you do those things (e.g. <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">Learn in Public</a>).</p> <p><strong>Prospecting</strong> is a term I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting">borrowed from the oil exploration industry</a>. <strong>Prospecting is a highly Active habit, and highly Strategic.</strong> These days, when you look for oil, there is a whole science to handicapping whether or not a plot of land is likely to have oil. You don't know it for a fact, all you're doing is estimating probabilities. Not to get too tautological, but you will be luckier if you can consistently assess and move towards areas where you are more likely to be "lucky". It might look like luck to others, but the motion and intention you invested to get yourself in a position to be lucky was far from random. I've also written many times about how I think strategic <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22&amp;oq=swyx.io+%22megatrends%22">manoeuvring for "Megatrends"</a> is a good idea.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2> <p> <img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/5075sq79y4pstxpp4pdk.png"> </p> <p>This is the state of my thinking on luck right now. That last bit you just read is pretty fresh, I might come back and change this in a couple years when I have refined my thoughts. I welcome any and all feedback.</p> <p>But overall, the message I really want to leave you with is this: <strong>you can create luck</strong>. That's it. I don't care how you do it, what mental model you use, who you quote. I just care <em>that</em> you do it. <strong>Go make yourself more lucky.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Ordinarily I'd wish you good luck, but now you have something better than a mere wish 😂</p> </blockquote> </section> <hr>  </div> </main>  </div></div></div>]]>

            </header>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Recently, I came across a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i48b5q/for_those_that_work_for_a_team_that_has_both_data/" target="_blank">Reddit thread</a> on the different roles in data science and machine learning: data scientist, decision scientist, product data scientist, data engineer, machine learning engineer, machine learning tooling engineer, AI architect, etc.</p>

<p>I found this <em>worrying</em>. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.</p>

<p>IMHO, <strong>I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end</strong>. Here, I’ll discuss the <a href="#from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">benefits</a> and <a href="#but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">counter-arguments</a>, <a href="#the-best-way-to-pick-it-up-is-via-learning-by-doing">how to</a> become end-to-end, and the experiences of <a href="#end-to-end-in-stitch-fix-and-netflix">Stitch Fix and Netflix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-start-identify-the-problem-to-finish-solve-it">From start (identify the problem) to finish (solve it)</h2>

<p>You may have come across similar <em>labels</em> and definitions, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-shouldnt-be-a-data-science-generalist-f69ea37cdd2c" target="_blank">Generalist</a>: Focused on roles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_manager" target="_blank">PM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst" target="_blank">BA</a>, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/data-engineering-a-quick-and-simple-definition/" target="_blank">DE</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_scientists" target="_blank">DS</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-does-a-machine-learning-engineer-do" target="_blank">MLE</a>); some negative connotation</li>
  <li><a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">Full-stack</a>: Focused on tech (Spark, Torch, Docker); popularized by full-stack devs</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3429185/stop-searching-for-that-data-science-unicorn.html" target="_blank">Unicorn</a>: Focused on mythology; believed not to exist</li>
</ul>

<p>I find these definitions to be more prescriptive than I prefer. Instead, I have a simple (and pragmatic) definition: An end-to-end data scientist can <strong>identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value</strong>. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the problem? Why is it important?</li>
  <li>Can we solve it? How should we solve it?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>Data Science Processes</summary>
<div>
<p>Another way of defining end-to-end data science is via processes. These processes are usually complex and I’ve left them out of the main discussion. Nonetheless, here are a few in case you’re curious:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (1997).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining#Process" target="_blank">KDD</a>: Knowledge Discovery in Databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview" target="_blank">TDSP</a>: Team Data Science Process, proposed by Microsoft in 2018.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dslp/dslp" target="_blank">DSLP</a>: Data Science Lifecycle Process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if these processes seem heavy and overwhelming. You don’t have to adopt them wholesale—start bit by bit, keep what works and adapt the rest.</p>
</div>

</details>

<h2 id="more-context-faster-iteration-greater-satisfaction">More context, faster iteration, greater satisfaction</h2>

<p>For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact. (Nonetheless, there are <a href="https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/US-CA-Santa-Clara/Senior-Deep-Learning-Data-Scientist--RAPIDS---AI_JR1929838" target="_blank">roles</a> that focus on machine learning.)</p>

<p><strong>Working end-to-end provides increased context.</strong> While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem. Let’s say conversion has decreased and a PM raises a request to improve our search algorithm. However, what’s causing the decrease in the first place? There could be various causes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product: Is fraudulent/poor quality product reducing customer trust?</li>
  <li>Data pipelines: Has data quality been compromised or are there delays/outages?</li>
  <li>Model refresh: Is the model not refreshing regularly/correctly?</li>
</ul>

<p>More often than not, the problem—and solution—lies <em>outside</em> of machine learning. A solution to <em>improve the algorithm</em> would miss the root cause.</p>

<p>Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it</li>
  <li>Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app</li>
</ul>

<p>By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.</p>

<p><strong>Communication and coordination overhead is reduced.</strong> With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. – Frederick P. Brooks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DE and DS need to <em>communicate</em> on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.</p>

<p>It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.</p>

<p>While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.</p>

<p>(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)</p>

<details><summary>The Cost of Communication and Coordination</summary>
<div>
<p>Richard Hackman, a Harvard psychologist, showed that the number of relationships in a team is <code><span>N</span><span>(</span><span>N</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>2</span></code>, where <code><span>N</span></code> is the number of people. This leads to exponential growth in links, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A start-up team of 7 has 21 links to maintain</li>
  <li>A group of 21 (i.e., three start-up teams) has 210 links</li>
  <li>A group of 63 has almost 2,000 links.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our simple example, we only had three roles (i.e., six links). But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate. (Amazon’s <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/small-teams-why-startups-often-win-against-google-and-facebook-the-science-behind-why-smaller-teams-get-more-done/" target="_blank">two-pizza teams</a> are a possible solution to this.)</p>
</div>
</details>

<p><strong>Iteration and learning rate is increased.</strong> With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.</p>

<p>This is especially important for developing data and algorithmic products. Unlike software engineering (a far more mature craft), we can’t do all the learning and design before we start building—our blueprints, architectures, and design patterns are not as developed. Thus, rapid iteration is essential for the design-build-learn cycle.</p>

<p><strong>There’s greater ownership and accountability.</strong> Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.</p>

<p>A common anti-pattern observed is “<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ThrownOverTheWall" target="_blank">throw over the wall</a>”. For example, the DE creates features and throws a database table to the DS, the DS trains a model and throws <code>R</code> code over to the MLE, and the MLE translates it to <code>Java</code> to production.</p>

<p>If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.</p>

<p>Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.</p>

<details><summary>Diffusion of Responsibilty &amp; Social Loafing</summary>
<div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility" target="_blank">Diffusion of responsibility</a>: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation. </p>

<p>One form of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Bystander_effect" target="_blank">Bystander effect</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" target="_blank">Kitty Genovese</a> was stabbed outside the apartment building across the street from where she lived. While there were 38 witnesses who saw or heard the attack, none called the police or helped her.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing" target="_blank">Social loafing</a>: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.</p>

</div>
</details>

<p><strong>For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/how-employees-are-motivated-autonomy-mastery-purpose/" target="_blank">closely tied</a> to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of <em>purpose</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-we-need-specialist-experts-too">But, we need specialist experts too</h2>

<p>Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:</p>

<p><strong>Wanting to specialize</strong> in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: <a href="https://mc.ai/the-subtle-art-of-priming-gpt-3/" target="_blank">GPT-3 primer</a>). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.</p>

The inner voice can mislead us.</p>  <p>For <a href="https://patriciachurchland.com/" target="_blank">Patricia Churchland</a>, professor emerita in philosophy at University of California San Diego, it's instructive to know more about the origins of our human consciences. She argues the starting point could be as early as the first warm-blooded animals more than 200 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What began as an adaptation to foraging in cold or nighttime environments spurred further adaptations, such as a propensity to nurture, socialize, and learn from others.</p>  <p>Brain structures encouraging social behaviour took mammals right up to the doorstep of what we call morality in humans.</p>  <p>"I don't think that human behaviour is different in kind from the behaviour we see in chimpanzees, or baboons, or wolves," Churchland told <em>IDEAS</em> host Nahlah Ayed.</p>  <p>"I think it is more complicated because our ecology — especially now — is more complicated."</p>  <h2>Vole brain&nbsp;breakthrough</h2>  <p>Churchland wants the scientific research to inform what has long been a philosophical or religious conversation. Often, thinkers tried to answer questions such as "Why be good?" with appeals to reason or divine authority.</p>  <p>The biological story offers us a different answer: brain wiring.</p>  <p>"Why is [being social] so meaningful? Why do we care?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I create an educational product and students occasionally ask for discounts. So-called "educational" discounts are very popular, but I don't give them.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't like them at all, but there is some nuance.</p> <p>Not all educational discounts bother me—primarily it's the discounts limited to students at degree-granting institutions and especially those tied to having a .edu email address.</p> <h2 id="why-might-edu-discounts-be-good"><a href="#why-might-edu-discounts-be-good">#</a> Why might .edu discounts be good?</h2> <p>Many of the arguments for student discounts are similar to those for region-based discounts, which I am a fan of. So let's look at some reasons to give discounts in general.</p> <h3 id="need"><a href="#need">#</a> Need</h3> <p>The idea behind student discounts, at least as it was first explained to me, sounds great. Students are often broke so it's only fair to give them a price break!</p> <p>I totally get that. As a student myself, I worked as a waiter, a calculus tutor, a bar tender and even started a house painting franchise in order not to get buried in debt. I went to a cheap state school, back when it was only about 70% of what it costs now, and I was <em>still</em> broke.</p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to pay their way through school in the US now. I have even more sympathy for anyone taking out debts they likely won't repay for many, many years.</p> <h3 id="price-discrimination"><a href="#price-discrimination">#</a> Price discrimination</h3> <p>In economics, <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/microessays/pd/price-discrimination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price discrimination</a> refers to the idea of charging some customers more than others in order to maximize revenue.</p> <p>In the extreme form, it would mean charging each customer the absolute maximum price they're willing to pay and completely eliminating <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/188/concepts/definition-of-consumer-surplus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer surplus</a>. This isn't practical or possible in most cases, but less extreme forms are very common.</p> <p>Sometimes customers are segmented by their actions, such as spending time clipping coupons or watching movies during typical work hours. Other times, customers are segmented simply by who they are. Senior discounts or higher prices for foreign tourists are both common examples.</p> <p>A less direct form of price discrimination is to create a slightly different product that would only appeal to customers with more money. In software, we see this often with features revolving around team management, accounting and compliance. This makes it possible to both sell to frugal hobbyist users and to charge large companies very high prices.</p> <h3 id="creating-habits"><a href="#creating-habits">#</a> Creating habits</h3> <p>For most, going to college is a time of major life transitions. Other than marriage, having children or serving in the military there are few times when people change as much.</p> <p>This is <strong>incredibly</strong> appealing to marketers.</p> <p>The opportunity to reach people when they're at a place where they're open to creating so many new habits that will stick with them for years or even decades is worth spending heavily on. One way to do it is through advertising. Another is by giving students a steep discount.</p> <h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">#</a> The problem</h2> <p>In a number of ways that matter to me, educational discounts <em>as they are typically implemented</em> are radically different from region or need-based discounts.</p> <h3 id="who-has-a-edu-email-address"><a href="#who-has-a-edu-email-address">#</a> Who has a .edu email address?</h3> <p>Who has a .edu email address? Generally it's only students, faculty and alumni of accredited US colleges. This roughly translates to "many of the most priviledged people in the world".</p> <p>The vast majority of adults in the US <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S1501&amp;hidePreview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do not have a 4-year degree</a>. There are probably a billion people in the world who would <em>love</em> to either enter a US college themselves or get their children into one.</p> <p>Competition for those slots is fierce. People spend small fortunes on English language education for a shot. I've seen it first-hand living in Asia for most my adult life.</p> <p>Obviously, not <em>everyone</em> with a .edu email address is or will be wealthy. However in aggregate, their parents are wealthier and they will be wealthier than any country in the world... by a large margin. At a minimum, getting a 4-year degree costs tens of thousands of dollars. Saving a few dollars a month on my <a href="https://alchemist.camp/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screencasts</a> is trivial in comparison.</p> <p>In contrast, the average person in Nigeria earns 2,000 USD/year. Even the average programmer isn't making much compared to their counterparts in other countries. Nigerians are also a double digit percentage of my audience! Indians are a large percentage as well.</p> <p>I have a <em>completely</em> different reaction when someone living in poor country asks for a discount than I do when someone spending more per year on tuition than I earned until my late 20s does.</p> <h3 id="who-is-a-student"><a href="#who-is-a-student">#</a> Who is a student?</h3> <p>An even more salient question is, who counts as a student. I've spent a great deal of time as a non-credentialed student at language schools, at a programming school and even completely on my own with a self-designed curriculum.</p> <p>During those times, I wasn't very successful in asking for educational discounts since nearly all are tied to credential-offering schools. I often thought about why and settled on two answers.</p> <ol><li>They probably worry about non-students claiming to be students to get the discount.</li> <li>Their educational discounts weren't really motivated by any sense of altruism or fairness to begin with.</li></ol> <h3 id="hypocrisy"><a href="#hypocrisy">#</a> Hypocrisy</h3> <p>Perhaps the thing that <em>most</em> bothers me about student discounts I see announced is the virtue signalling.</p> <p>If you're offering a discount to get your customers hooked early in their careers or to raise prices for business users, great. But you're not doing a noble thing if you're restricting a discount to people with .edu addresses.</p> <p>What that discount model actually does is exclude all of the students in poorer parts of the world as well as anyone who couldn't stomach going $100k in debt for a credential.</p> <h3 id="what-does-the-discount-subsidize"><a href="#what-does-the-discount-subsidize">#</a> What does the discount subsidize?</h3> <p>As economists love to point out, incentives matter. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. This isn't just true of governments, but it's also true of companies and other groups.</p> <p>That leads ato the question of what educational discounts subsidize. In effect, they subsidize going to very expensive universities. Is this something we want more of?</p> <p>In what's likely a minority opinion, I think too many people pursue formalized schooling for too long. Universities are necessary for some kinds of careers and for some kinds of research. Far more often, the price is just too high. The worst part of this cost isn't dollars either—it's four years of a person's life.</p> <p>Nearly anything universities teach can be learned outside of a university, and usually faster. I've experienced this first hand with mathematics, foreign languages and programming but it's certainly a wider phenomena.</p> <p>According to George Mason economist Bryan Caplan, <a href="https://amzn.to/2YLbmNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only about 10%-20% of the value in schooling is actually education</a>. The other 80%-90% is selection and signalling.</p> <h2 id="what-products-are-exceptions"><a href="#what-products-are-exceptions">#</a> What products are exceptions?</h2> <p>If I were selling very expensive tools for skilled professionals, like Adobe used to, then I'd offer student discounts. Even a person in relatively fortunate circumstances has fewer resources than a typical company.</p> <p>Dropping a few dollars a month doesn't move the needle compared to tuition, but spending thousands of dollars on a photo or video editor sure could.</p> <p>Another factor in Adobe's case was that by being <em>the</em> tool to use in the industry, students needed to learn it. Anyone trying to become a designer pretty much had to find a way, even if that meant "pirating" it. Giving students convenient affordable access to such a tool is also a great way to <em>become</em> a standard tool in the industry.</p> <p>Even Adobe didn't limit their discounts to US students, though. Doing so might have cost them billions.</p> <h2 id="the-bottom-line"><a href="#the-bottom-line">#</a> The bottom line</h2> <p>Having a .edu email address generally means being in the most expensive and desired university system in the world.</p> <br>  <br> <hr></div></div>]]>

						<p><span>Once, small firms centred on inventors were responsible for most of our innovation. Larger firms might buy or exploit these steps forwards, but they did not typically make them. And then for a brief period, this changed: many of the best new products, tools, and ideas came from research labs within large corporations. This brief period also happened to be the era when scientific, technological, and economic productivity sped forward at its fastest ever clip. Yet almost as soon as it arrived, the fruitful period was over and we returned to a situation where small companies and small-business-like teams at universities developed innovations outside of large companies and sold them in a market for ideas. Though we might enjoy the innovation created by small flexible firms, we should not dismiss the contributions made by large corporate labs. The corporate lab may be creeping back, but aggressively prosecuting antitrust against large firms growing organically through in-house research could easily snuff this spark out.</span></p>
<h3>The USA’s first system of innovation</h3>
<p><span>When the USA began to contribute to the progress of technology, in the early 19th century, it was largely practically-minded, not based on deep scientific understanding. Rather, it largely consisted of individual inventors commercialising their own inventions. Whereas nuclear power depended on decades or centuries of progress in physics, many late 19th century innovations were more like the cotton gin, which came together through practical-minded trial and error in the field. By the late 19th century, the system had morphed into one we would find strangely familiar today: inventors invented, venture capitalists invested, and companies commercialised. The system even had </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>patent lawyers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/khan_ip2_working_paper.pdf"><span>non-practising entities</span></a>, <span>which own patents purely </span><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/Documents/BHR870102.pdf"><span>to litigate on their behalf</span></a><span>. There were still startups commercialising an idea and scaling it up themselves, but many inventors found that the division of labour enabled by the market ideas allowed them to </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-history-review/article/patent-alchemy-the-market-for-technology-in-us-history/90991329A8D4A49EBF7B49D2EAD1CE7A"><span>focus on what they did best</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Large firms were consumers of ideas created by inventors, and were sceptical of the value of doing in-house science. They believed it was easier to buy new science off the shelf. In 1885 T. D. Lockwood, head of American Bell Telephone Company’s patent department, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“I am fully convinced that it has never, is not now, and never will pay commercially, to keep an establishment of professional inventors, or of men whose chief business it is to invent”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Of course, Bell Labs itself later grew to be one of the marquees of commercial labs—in the late 1960s it employed 15,000 people including 1,200 PhDs, who between them made too many important inventions to list, from the transistor and the photovoltaic cell to the first digitally scrambled voice audio (in 1943) and the first complex number calculator (in 1939). Fourteen of its staff went on to win Nobel Prizes and five to win </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award"><span>Turing Awards</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The 1920s stock market boom was in large part driven by a huge rise in the value that investors </span><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.98.4.1370"><span>accorded to intangible capital</span></a><span> and ideas held within companies. A similar thing happened in the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalism-Without-Capital-Intangible-Economy/dp/0691175039"><span>1990s Dot-com Bubble</span></a><span>. Between 1921 and 1927 the number of scientists and engineers in industrial labs more than doubled. When the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit it caused a </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d71a/90cfa2d0d0d72f13724d27dd326209431974.pdf"><span>massive and persistent decline</span></a><span> in independent inventing and the startup-like activity around it. But large labs continued to boom, increasing staffing and research spending throughout the lean 1930s, and earning more patents. By 1930, most patents were issued to large firms, rather than independent innovators, and this gap only widened into the 1950s. The industrial lab had become king.</span></p>
<h3>Why labs work well</h3>
<p><span>The question of why the industrial lab works is a microcosm of the question of why the firm works in general. Economist Ronald Coase, who won the Nobel Prize in 1991 (and who lived to be 102) bookended the most productive period of his career with two insights about transaction costs. The first, published in 1937 and entitled </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x"><span>“The Nature of the Firm”</span></a><span>, tells us why firms exist. In economics, situations are typically approached from the perspective of competitive behaviour in open markets. Most of the things we buy are from open, competitive markets like these. But when we sell our labour, we are usually bound to a single “buyer”—our employer—for an extended period of time for everything we have to offer. If market competition is so efficient, why do we not set up mini-firms for every instance of cooperative work and receive pay in line with our output? Why do we instead generally sell a promise to do whatever our boss says within limits for certain hours of the day for months or years in advance?</span></p>
<p><span>The other, </span><a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/coase-problem.pdf"><span>“The Problem of Social Cost”</span></a><span>, reads like a reflection of the first. Published in 1960, it spawned the so-called Coase Theorem, which holds that so long as transaction costs—the costs of interacting with other individuals or institutions, such as the costs of drawing up and enforcing a contract—are low, people will contract to deal with the problems emerging from positive and negative externalities, like the benefits of a new park to a neighbourhood or the costs of pollution. Where transaction costs are too high, institutions and policies are needed to deal with the externalities instead.</span></p>
<p><span>Coase answers the question of why businesses exist as he answers the question of why people simply don’t contract away all externalities: transaction costs. If there is a cost on both sides every time one person wants to pay another for a task, then some tasks will not be worth paying for, or worth doing at the going rate. Concretely: an employer who does not negotiate contracts for each and every individual work unit can afford to offer higher wages, and an employee who does not do so can afford to accept lower wages. Companies organized in this way thus outcompete pure market organization—in cases where transaction costs are large.</span></p>
<p><span>In many ways, this general story for why firms exist also explains why large firm R&amp;D labs were so successful. The transaction costs of collaboration are extremely large, and prevent all sorts of potentially-valuable crossovers: not just the financial costs of contracting with others, but the costs of finding people you work well with, of corresponding and collaborating with people far from you, and so on. University lecturers collaborate more with those in their department than in other departments, and more with those in their university or city than elsewhere, despite all the tools and technologies the internet has brought. Chance meetings are another driver of serendipitous discovery and unexpected but fruitful collaborations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, without great efforts in ‘translation’, many scientific ideas can be completely disconnected from practical applications. A research lab brings an array of scientific experts together from different disciplines, for collaboration and drawing on expertise at low cost. Fellow researchers bump into one another. And the firm context means the potential impact in terms of usable products is always taken into account.</span></p>
<h3>The DARPA Era</h3>
<p><span>The era of the R&amp;D lab has one particularly legendary story and paradigmatic example: PARC. Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre—the location in Palo Alto, now the home of companies like Tesla, Palantir, and Google, is no coincidence—developed many of the foundational building blocks of today’s technology and economy. In the 1970s, PARC researchers built the first computer with a graphical user interface, the first laser printer, the first Ethernet cable, and the first user-friendly word processor. Steve Jobs visited PARC in 1979, aged 24, and incorporated many of the ideas into Apple products. Charles Simonyi, a key developer at PARC, moved to Microsoft, where he developed the Office suite. But Xerox itself, which is still largely known for making photocopiers, did not capitalise on these inventions.</span></p>
<p><span>PARC, in turn, had hired many of its workers from Augmentation Research Centre, a publicly-funded project which pioneered the computer mouse, hyperlinks, the earliest predecessor to the internet, and many smaller innovations we take for granted in today’s computer ecosystem. ARC was funded by ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now DARPA. Though DARPA (then ARPA) is funded by the US Department of Defence, it shares many elements with golden era R&amp;D labs. They are organised around a mission and a goal—even the most basic research is done with an end in mind—but researchers are given a lot of freedom to make their own decisions.</span></p>
<h3>A return to the market for ideas</h3>
<p><span>The scale of the change since the 1970s is huge—big businesses have retreated from research. In the 1960s, DuPont, the chemicals giant, published more in the </span><i><span>Journals of the American Chemical Society</span></i><span> than both MIT and Caltech combined. R&amp;D magazine, which awards the R&amp;D 100 to the hundred innovations it judges most innovative in a given four year period, gave 41% of its awards to Fortune 500 companies in its 1971 iteration and 47% in 1975. By 2006, 6% of the awards were going to firms in the Fortune 500. The great majority of these awards are now being won by federal labs, university teams, and spin-offs from academia. The lone inventor is back.</span></p>
<p><span>This is reflected by declines in the shares of patents going to the biggest businesses, and in the shares of scientists working there. In 1971 just over seven per cent of scientists in industry tracked by the US National Science Foundation worked in firms with under 1,000 employees; by 2004 this was 32%. In 2003 around a quarter worked at firms with fewer than ten employees. Even pharmaceuticals, the one area where large internal research labs are still significant, has been affected—around half of the drugs approved so far in the 2010s were originally discovered by small biotech startups.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, participation by large American firms in …</span></p></div></div></div>

We will be using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/">Netlify Redirects</a> and a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a>.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to create my own URL shortener and use it to shorten all my links. But I always felt like creating it would take a lot of effort, although I never actually gave much thought to it. </p>

<p>But I came across a tweet containing a link to the video which showed how to create a simple URL shortener. This blog post is my attempt to share that approach with you.</p>
<p>Before we see how to create your own URL shortener, let's see why having a URL shortener can be useful.</p>
<p>If you are already convinced that having your own URL shortener can be useful, you can skip this section and directly jump to <a href="#creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-shortening-your-urls">Benefits of Shortening Your URLs</h2>
<h3 id="it-masks-the-original-links">It masks the original links.</h3>
<p>Masking the URL has many advantages</p>
<p>For example, take this URL - <code>hashnode.com/series/how-i-made-a-markdown-editor-with-ability-to-embed-youtube-videos-codepens-etc-cke6g1y2x00afxms17vp30803</code></p>
<p>This URL is the link to the series that I am writing on <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hashnode">Hashnode</a> where I am developing a full-featured Markdown editor from scratch. But, the URL is so long and difficult to read and share on platforms like twitter. </p>
<p>Instead, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple short URL like <code>pbt.im/markdown-series</code> which redirects to the above URL. It's short, crisp, readable, and also equally conveys what one can expect in that link.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-affiliate-links">Sharing affiliate links.</h3>
<p>Other places where URL shortening can be useful is when you want to share or brand an ugly affiliate link, or when the domain of the link that you want to share is very long.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the shortened links that I frequently use. </p>

<p>Sharing the above links is so easy. You don't even have to copy them. You can just type them out yourself. They are short, consistent, readable and can easily be remembered.</p>
<h3 id="links-can-change">Links can change</h3>
<p>Another disadvantage of sharing normal links is that the links can potentially change in the future. </p>
<p>If they do change, you can't hunt down every post and every place where you posted or shared that link and then update it. And it might not always be feasible to redirect the old URL to a new URL. </p>
<p>Shortened links can come in very handy in this situation. The shortened link that you share need not change ever. Whereas the URL that the short link should redirect to can change as you wish.</p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>I even started using my URL shortener to create bookmarks. I added a short URL(<code>/bookmarks</code>) that redirects to a GitHub page which contains all my other short URLs. Then whenever I want to bookmark a very useful URL, instead of bookmarking it normally, I started shortening it, which will automatically add it to my list of short URLs (which means it will also be available at <code>/bookmarks</code>)</p>
<p>Now that we saw some of the reasons of how shortened URLs can help us, let's see how to create one yourself.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-url-shortener">Creating Your Own URL Shortener</h2>

<p>This is the tweet that inspired me to explore and create a URL shortener for shortening my links. I finally ended up using the approach that Kent suggested. I will be explaining the same in this article.</p>

<p>Before we jump into the actual content, let's see what Netlify redirects are. Netlify gives us an easy way to handle redirects for any site that is hosted on the platform. All you have to do is create a <code>_redirects</code> file and then add the redirect rules in that file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a <code>_redirects</code> file, each redirect rule must be listed on a separate line, with the original path followed by the new path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a comment.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>/home              /</span>
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
<span>/cuties            https:/</span>/www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This is the bare minimum that you need to create your own URL shortener. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty project with a single file called <code>_redirects</code>.</li>
<li>Add your short and complete URLs there.</li>
<li>Deploy that project to Netlify. </li>
</ul>
<p>You now have your own simple URL shortener. </p>
<p>Every time you want to add a new URL, you can just add it in the <code>_redirects</code> file and then deploy it. If using this workflow is good enough for you, you can stop here and use it.</p>
<p>But Kent went a step further and created a package called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener">netlify-shortener</a> which simplifies the workflow of creating short URLs even further.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start using <code>netlify-shortener</code> and set up your own URL shortener</p>
<h4 id="step-1-create-an-empty-project">Step 1: Create an empty project</h4>
<pre><code>mkdir url-shortener
<span>cd</span> url-shortener
</code></pre><h4 id="step-2-initialize-it-as-npm-project">Step 2: Initialize it as npm project</h4>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span> -y
</code></pre><h4 id="step-3-create-a-redirects-file-and-add-the-following-content">Step 3: Create a <code>_redirects</code> file and add the following content.</h4>
<pre><code>
/*       https://your-website.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>your-website.com</code> will act as a fallback when the URL doesn't match any of the available short URLs. Replace it with whatever URL you want to have as a fallback.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-add-homepage-and-shorten-script-to-your-packagejson-add-your-own-short-domain-url-to-the-homepage">Step 4: Add homepage and shorten script to your package.json (Add your own short domain URL to the homepage)</h4>
<pre><code>{
  "<span>homepage</span>": <span>"https://pbt.im"</span>,
  "<span>scripts</span>": {
    "<span>shorten</span>": <span>"netlify-shortener"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can run the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>npm</span> run shorten 


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//</span>yahoo.com


<span>npm</span> run shorten https:<span>//gi</span>thub.com gh
</code></pre><p>The <code>npm run shorten</code> command</p>
<ul>
<li>Generates a shortcode automatically if it is not provided.</li>
<li>Validates your URL.</li>
<li>Automatically check for URL collisions and throws an error if there is a collision.</li>
<li>Adds the URL to the top of the <code>_redirects</code> file and reformats the file properly.</li>
<li>Pulls the changes from remote, adds the new shortened URL, commits the code, and then pushes the commit to the remote again.</li>
<li>Automatically copies the short URL to your clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't even have to provide <code>https://</code>, by default it assumes that the original link is <code>https://</code></p>
<p>You can even add it as a global command in your shell using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener#shell-function">these instructions</a></p>
<h3 id="my-workflow-for-shortening-a-url">My workflow for shortening a URL</h3>
<p>Open the terminal and simply write <code>shorten original-URL short-slug</code>. </p>
<p>For example, to shorten the link to my Github profile, I will run the following command </p>
<pre><code><span>shorten</span> github.com/pbteja1998 gh
</code></pre><h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink1.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>Images courtesy of Neuralink.</sub></p><p>You probably heard about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-neuralinks-tech-live-using-pigs-with-surgically-implanted-brain-monitoring-devices/" target="_blank">the latest Neuralink demo</a>
by now. I’m referring to the one where Elon Musk showed pigs with brain implants walking around and making cute noises. But why should you care? Is this just another publicity stunt by a rich billionaire with eccentric pet projects, or does it actually matter?</p><iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVvmgjBL74w?start=947" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><sub>Click above to see the part of the presentation where the pig sniffs around and sounds play whenever the neurons associated with his snout fire. Trust me, it’s adorable. From now on, this is the sound I’ll play in my mind whenever I see animals sniffing around.</sub></p><p>The Neuralink demo is a big deal for several reasons. Most importantly, it shows a fully-working brain-machine interface product in a living being. I cannot emphasize how incredible this is. Creating a brain implant is a hard task. Not only do you have to figure out how to stick something in a brain without hurting it, but keeping that thing in place, building the software to interpret the signals coming from it, and then removing it with minimal damage is an endeavor that presents serious challenges at every step of the way. Making all of the above into a <em>product</em>, not a week-long surgery research project, is a truly Promethean achievement.</p><p>The fact that Neuralink is closer to delivering a product and not just research matters a lot. We’ve heard about advances in brain-machine interface research for decades now, but all the results have been highly experimental. Building a product and not an experiment means that all those results, from restoring speech to restoring movement, are closer to being used by those who actually need them. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to obtaining neural data from humans creates an unprecedented opportunity to better understand our own minds, not to mention traditionally elusive topics like consciousness.</p><p>One of the first things that stood out to me in the demo was how Neuralink inserts the brain-machine interface device into the brain. Insertion is something Neuralink has brought up in past presentations, but this time they showed a particularly good video of how it works. In order to insert sensors in a brain without damaging it, the Neuralink team has built electrodes in the shape of small wires that are 1/4 of the diameter of human hair. These electrodes are then inserted through a skull opening using a high-precision robot that scans the brain area <em>during</em> surgery, which allows it to avoid any blood vessels, no matter how small. This procedure reduces tissue damage and increases the probability that the implant won’t be outright rejected by the brain. To see how cool this is, just watch the demo below:</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/p8ADyp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>The robot misses the blood vessels every time! This takes place in an area where distances are measured in micrometers - 1/100000 of a meter. This procedure is not something that would work without major advances in robotics and computer vision. Having a human do it by hand is out of the question. I suggest you go back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/DVvmgjBL74w?t=646" target="_blank">original demo</a> and watch the high-definition video to see just how good the robot is at this job.</p><p>The fact that the robot can implant a <em>Link</em> (Neuralink’s name for the sensor) in under an hour is a great achievement too. Neuralink’s goal is to make getting a brain-machine interface as easy as getting Lasik eye surgery. This demo showed that they’re not joking about delivering on this promise.</p><p>Another thing that truly stood out to me is how secure and inconspicuous the <em>Link</em> interface looked on the pig’s head. I couldn’t even spot it! This is really important, since if you’re about to make something that living beings are supposed to wear every day, you might as well make sure it’s not awkward or annoying. Even better, the interface should feel like it’s part of your own body.</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink2.jpg" alt="Neuralink Press Image">
<sub>The new <em>Link</em> brain-machine interface.</sub></p><p>This is an area that did not receive a lot of attention before Neuralink. For example, when hospitals perform invasive brain-recordings using traditional methods like ECoG, wires come out of your head through skull openings. Since the brain is a squishy mass surrounded by liquid, keeping the liquid <em>in</em> and the area around the opening <em>clean</em> becomes an incredibly difficult task. Nurses have to hover around patients constantly to make sure that the wires are not coming loose and that the brain ooze is being cleaned so that no infections take place.</p><p>What makes the <em>Link</em> so revolutionary is that it’s a standalone device. By removing the need for charging or data transfer wires, this brain-machine interface is closer to an Apple Watch-level wearable than anything else that has been built so far. Seeing the charging puck (which seems to have copied the Apple Watch charging puck) offered perhaps the clearest glimpse of the future in the entire presentation (so did the 1-day battery life, which, while amazing for a device this size, will also lead to some really funny memes about how our brains will run out of battery and need to be charged).</p><p><img src="https://theodormarcu.com/images/neuralink/neuralink3.jpg" alt="Neuralink Inductive Charging Mechanism">
<sub>Is this going to be worse than forgetting to charge your phone at night?.</sub></p><p>Having something that fits neatly in your skull and blocks liquid from coming out without the need for wires is a major achievement. I’m sure there is still a lot of work to be done, especially given Elon’s calls for help from sealing experts, but seeing something as good as what we’ve seen today shows a great degree of progress.</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering@neuralink.com</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1284306733720940544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote><p>Another noteworthy aspect of the <em>Link</em> interface is the signal processing. In this regard, the pig-sniffing-with-sounds demo was ok, since it didn’t really use any fancy techniques. What really stood out was predicting and interpreting brain signals using the information from the <em>Link</em> sensors.</p><video id="video" muted="" preload="auto" poster="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.jpg" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://j.gifs.com/vl0MOm.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>These demos can get a bit hand-wavey and Neuralink did not provide a lot of information about the techniques used to produce this particular example. However, given the fact that deep learning has been shown to be really good at brain signal decoding and prediction, I wouldn’t be suprised if Neuralink and OpenAI partenered on advancing signal processing using deep learning once the hardware is ready. Given Elon’s obsession with the singularity, I wouldn’t be surprised if this happened sooner.</p><p>Overall, I’m really excited about the future of invasive brain-machine interfaces after seeing this demo. While the jump from animals to humans is a big one and I’m sure Elon errs on being overly-optimistic when it comes to the timeline, this is a historical moment similar to launching the first dog into space. The fact that this is possible today opens an endless array of opportunities for the future of humanity.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-obfuscated-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-36ec615c8f5d">two</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@LainIwakura/deobfuscating-code-for-fun-and-no-profit-round-2-60d78b67ebce">posts</a>
on medium.com explaining the workings of some obfuscated programs. After these posts other stuff took priority and I forgot about the world of obfuscation for a while. Now though, I find myself returning to it.
For reasons I’ll explain in a different post I find studying obfuscated code to be quite valuable. So, I thought to myself ‘Well, those last programs I examined were honestly pretty simple. What would it be like to research a truly obfuscated program?’</p>
<p>This post is the story of that journey. I will discuss the code, how I got such old and obscure code to run, as well as include snippets from my conversations with
one of the original authors (who was very helpful in figuring some of this out). If all that wasn’t enough I managed to obtain the original PDP and VAX source code, it will be hosted here with permission. I want to give a huge thank you to Sjoerd Mullender and Don Libes for their assistance and permission in reproducing some of this material.</p>

<p>Because older obfuscated programs tend to be easier to dissect I decided to stay in the early years of the IOCCC (International Obfuscated C Code Contest).
Among those early programs one sticks out as truly interesting - and that is the first IOCCC winner <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/mullender.c">mullender.c</a>, which I’ve also replicated below because it’s quite short.

<p>Where do you start with a program like this? Well, the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/1984/mullender/hint.text">hint</a> provided by the IOCCC is always a good first step.
From this hint, we can learn a few things necessary to understanding how the program works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, this program will only run on a PDP-11 or VAX-11.</li>
<li>The C startup routine - provided by crt0.o - transfers control to a location named ‘main’ - usually intended to be a function, but in this case it’s an array of shorts</li>
<li>These shorts (represented in different formats to enhance obfuscation) form a meaningful set of PDP-11 and VAX-11 instructions</li>
<li>The first instruction is a branch to the PDP code, and due to the way VAX calls the main ‘function’ it skips the first word of the program (I’ll discuss this more later).</li>
<li>The program prints a string</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, the program is a bunch of machine code instructions encoded in various formats. It runs because this code predates ANSI C by a half decade and old compilers seem to have had significantly less qualms about
‘main’ being a function or not (I tried to define ‘main’ as an array of shorts with a modern compiler and it did not like that one bit).</p>

<p>I admit it, the PDP-11 was before my time. I grew up in the Windows 95/98/2000 era, and until recently I didn’t even know what a PDP-11 was.
This ignorance left me kind of stuck, and a brief look on eBay confirmed that I was not going to get a working PDP-11 any time soon. Fortunately though,
an emulator exists. Enter <a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">SimH</a>, it’s more of a suite of emulators for a wide range of historical computers - of which the
PDP-11 is one, and lucky for us the VAX-11 is another.</p>
<p>After a few false starts and misadventures with 2.11BSD, I realized I had no idea what I was doing so I decided I needed some help.
The two original authors of this program are Robbert van Renesse and Sjoerd Mullender, why not try to contact them? So I did.
Robbert didn’t answer my e-mail, but luckily Sjoerd got back to me and was happy to discuss the program. He told me that the
PDP-11 OS they used was Unix v7, so I proceeded on that route.</p>
<p>I managed to <a href="http://a.papnet.eu/UNIX/v7/Installation">find a guide</a> on installing Unix v7 onto this emulator that worked;
and now with my emulator running, and OS installed, I could slap it into a file, compile, and run the thing. Below is what I got.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://lainsystems.com/img/running_on_pdp11.gif">
	
		<figcaption>Running the program on the PDP-11 using Unix v7</figcaption>
	
</figure>


<p>The animation is a little choppy, but even still you can hopefully see that it is printing “:-)” across the screen until it is forced to exit (there is no clean way to stop it).</p>
<p>In my discussions with Sjoerd, it was revealed that the string it prints is not exactly “:-)” but instead "  :-)\b\b\b\b”
(NOTE: there should be 2 space characters at the start but my templating engine is removing one for some reason).
It is exactly 9 bytes long. The first 2 characters are whitespace, followed by the :-), finally followed by four ‘\b’
characters. The ‘\b’ characters indicate a backspace. What does the backspace accomplish? Well, if you count 4 characters back from when they begin you’ll see we’re left with a single space - it is at this point
that the program loops and prints the string again. This happens quickly enough that to our eyes it looks like the “:-)” is scrolling across the screen - a clever effect.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the C code is not very useful to examine directly. As it also turns out, the assembly isn’t much better. Below is a small sample of what the assembly looks like (from the PDP-11’s perspective):</p>
<pre><code>    .text
    .globl  _main
    .data
    .even
_main:
    .word   0425 
    .word   04735
    .word   -010041
    .word   031
    .word   0
    .word   0735
    .word   01773
    .word   05757
</code></pre><p>So, what to do? Well, you can actually set up a cross compiler for the PDP-11 and if you go through that effort you can use the objdump program targeted at PDP-11 binaries.</p>
<p>Below is the relevant portion of the objdump - the whole thing is <a href="https://lainsystems.com/mull_objdump.txt">here</a>, but not all of it is useful. Sjoerd confirmed that the PDP code is
from _main+0x2c to _main+0x4a (inclusive). Of course, the first word is also a PDP-11 instruction. Everything I’ve ommitted is related to the VAX portion of
the program which we will get back to. (It’s also not proper VAX code since the disassembler thinks everything is PDP-11).</p>
<pre><code>   0:   0115            br  0x2c
  2c:   11c4            mov pc, r4
  2e:   0be4            tst -(r4)
  30:   e5c4 0009       sub $11, r4
  34:   1137 0006       mov r4, $0x3e
  38:   15c0 0001       mov $1, r0
  3c:   8904            sys 4
  3e:   0000            halt
  40:   0009            .word   11
  42:   15c2 0200       mov $1000, r2
  46:   892d            sys 55
  48:   7e82            sob r2, 0x46
  4a:   01f0            br  0x2c
</code></pre><p>Before going further there are 2 important things to know about PDP-11 assembly code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PDP-11 works primarily with octal. All the addresses and instructions are encoded in octal.</li>
<li>In an instruction like <code>mov pc, r4</code>, you are moving pc INTO r4, not r4 into pc. Personally, I got used to this pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first number in the original program is 277, put that into a hex converter and you’ll get 115 like we see in the objdump. More interesting though is what you get translating it into octal - 425.
How does 0425 get you br 0x2c though? Well for that you need to grab some <em>manuals</em>. I got my hands on a lot of old manuals for these computers but the most useful one was the PDP-11/45 Handbook from 1973.
It would helpfully describe the instruction format, and exactly what it did. Below is an example of the page for the unconditional branch instruction.</p>

<p>As you can see, it sets the program counter to pc + 2x the offset - which is 25 (octal) in our case. Since the program counter at the start of our program is 2 (because it points to the next word to execute),
we get 2 + (25 x 2), or 2 + 52 = 54, which translating back into hex gives us 2c. Cool!</p>

<p>Now that we know how the branch works we can examine the main stuff - I won’t go into huge depth with the manuals for each little instruction but doing so is fun if you’re bored and enjoy that sort of thing.</p>
<p>The next relevant portion of code is this:</p>
<pre><code>  mov pc, r4
  tst -(r4)
  sub $11, r4
  mov r4, $0x3e
  mov $1, r0
  sys 4
  halt
  .word   11
</code></pre><p>We move the program counter into the r4 register and then use the ‘test’ (tst) instruction. This has the effect of clearing the some flags in the PSW (processor status word), and because
the register is using ‘Autodecrement mode’ it will subtract 2 from the value stored at r4. When using autoincrement / decrement, it will go by 1 in byte instructions or 2 in word instructions.
After this we subtract 11 from r4, but 11 is actually 9 (used to octal yet?). Then we store r4 into…0x3e? Well, if you look back at the objdump you’ll see that 0x3e is ‘halt’ or 0000. This
mov instruction overwrites that value with the contents of r4. We move 1 into r0 (1 indicating STDOUT), and call ‘sys 4’. The next line will be the value of r4 as just mentioned, and <code>.word 11</code>
simply inserts octal 11 directly into that spot. If you’re wondering what exactly is in r4 and why we’re doing all this stuff, be patient - we’re getting there.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with system calls, you probably know what’s going on. If not, all of this is to setup the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_(system_call)">write</a> system call. I
actually made a <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/15590/trying-to-understand-some-assembly-syntax-in-the-unix-v7-write-system-call">post on the retro-computing stackexchange</a>
asking about the workings of this call internally - I recommend checking it out if you want further clarity on how this works.</p>
<p>After this we have the final 3 lines of PDP code which are:</p>
<pre><code>  mov $1000, r2
  sys 55
  sob r2, 0x46
</code></pre><p>We put 1000 into r2, and call system call 55. After this, we use the ‘sob’ instruction - which is ‘subtract one and branch’ and not an invitation to cry - to see if r2 is 0 yet. If it isn’t, we branch
to the previous line and call system call 55 again. loop until r2 is 0. Syscall 55 eh? Which …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>OpenMath is an emerging standard for representing mathematical objects with their semantics, allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on the worldwide web. While the original designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant mathematical content. There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation from the Worldwide Web Consortium, and a large overlap between the two developer communities. MathML deals principally with the presentation of mathematical objects, while OpenMath is solely concerned with their semantic meaning or content. While MathML does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it also allows semantic information encoded in OpenMath to be embedded inside a MathML structure. Thus the two technologies may be seen as highly complementary.</p>

<p>Mathematical objects encoded in OpenMath can be</p>

<ul>
  <li>displayed in a browser</li>
  <li>exchanged between software systems</li>
  <li>cut and pasted for use in different contexts</li>
  <li>verified as being mathematically sound (or not!)</li>
  <li>used to make interactive documents really interactive.</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMath is highly relevant for persons working with mathematics on computers, for those working with large documents (e.g. databases, manuals) containing mathematical expressions, and for technical and mathematical publishing.</p>

<p>The worldwide OpenMath activities are coordinated within the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. It is coordinated by an executive committee, elected by its members. It organizes regular workshops and hosts a number of electronic discussion lists. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had an hour-long conversation yesterday talking to a fellow entrepreneur who quit the adventure and took a job. He was curious to know what I had done differently to arrive at a positive outcome.</p><p>My first reaction was to tell him that this is not my first attempt. </p><p>I've tried building a company twice before and failed miserably. I even tried building a breakfast delivery business in 2015 (I had no idea what I was doing back then) and I made ₹85,000 in revenue before I shut it down.</p><p>SuperLemon is actually my fourth attempt. Sankalp and I did just enough things right this time (or avoided just enough mistakes) to make the business work. </p><p>The journey to reaching here was long, filled with doubt internally and from everyone around me, even frustrating and hopeless at times.</p><p>Out of all the things we talked during the call, the three things that stood out to me were:</p><h3><strong>1-</strong> I kept trying again and again</h3><p>If something didn't work, I would find a job to save up and try again as soon as I have a year's worth of runway and a strong enough conviction about the idea. </p><p>As of today, I don't see any other path in life but building businesses.</p><h3><strong>2-</strong> I knew when to quit</h3><p>When things weren't working out no matter our best effort, clearly there was something wrong. I spent 12 months on my second venture before realising there's no market demand. </p><p>But I quit my third venture (right before SuperLemon) in about 4 months when it was obvious to me that it wasn't going to work.</p><h3><strong>3-</strong> Introspect </h3><p>After every attempt or failure, I would spend between 1-3 months in intense introspection of what went wrong. </p><p>This wasn't an exercise to beat myself up over it, but rather to learn what I need to do differently the next time for things to work out more favourably.</p><h3>If you're a budding entrepreneur</h3><p>I don't recommend this path to anyone unless they are willing to take all the pain and failures, learn from them, and try again with the hope to eventually get it right.</p><p>Quit sooner than later when something isn't working, but only if you've understood why it won't work. </p><p>Ask always yourself if you're in it for the long haul. Otherwise you might as well quit right now.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2> What is the yield curve?</h2><p>The Yield Curve shows current yield rates, for US Treasuries, at varying maturities. That was a lot of jargon, so let's break it down.</p><canvas></canvas><p>US Treasuries represent bonds issued by the US Government. Think of a bond as any loan - the issuer of a bond has to pay interest each month, and the amount borrowed at maturity. Maturity refers to the period after which the bond is to be paid back. The US Government issues bonds for varying maturity rates, from 30 days to 30 years. And finally, the yield rate represents the effective interest rate for a bond, based on its current price.</p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>The yield curve sets the basic, or lowest possible, interest rates. Any changes in the yield curve have a ripple effect across the entire economy.</p><p>Effectively, the yield curve represents current interest rates for the US Government. The US Government is considered the safest borrower in the economy. So, it gets to borrow money at the lowest possible interest rates. Everyone else has to pay more interest, to compensate for the added risk. </p><p>Let's take a concrete example. On September 4, 2019, Apple issued bonds worth $7bn. These bonds had maturities ranging from 3 years, to 30 years. The yield rate on these bonds was higher than the US Government bond yields on the same day.</p><canvas></canvas><p>Similarly, if you want to take out a 30 year mortgage, your interest rate will be some number plus the interest rate of the 30 year treasury.</p><p>So when the yield curve rises, that means interest rates for everyone go up. It becomes more expensive for Apple to borrow money, or for you to get a mortage. If it's more expensive to borrow money, it's more expensive to spend money; and in this way, higher interest rates make economic growth harder.</p><p>The yield curve also matters because it's considered a predictor for future recessions.</p><h3>How is the yield curve a recession indicator?</h3><p>The shape of the yield curve offers some clues. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upwards. Remember, the higher risk the, the higher the interest rate. Shorter periods are safer - it's easier to predict what will happen in the next 30 days, than in the next 30 years.</p><p>When the yield curve is <em>inverted</em>, something is wrong. It means that rates for long term-periods are lower than interest rates for short-term periods. This is rare, and breaks the relationship we described above. It's so abnormal, that it is a reliable predictor of economic recessions.</p><p>The chart below is an example of an inverted yield curve; specifically, the yield curve for August 11, 2006. Yield curves were inverted for much of 2006 and 2007. It proved prophetic. In late 2007 we entered the deepest economic recession since the 1930s.</p><canvas></canvas><p>The graph below shows the <em>spread</em> between the 10 year treasury and the 3 month treasury. The spread is just the difference between two interest rates; so anytime the spread drops below 0, it means the yield curve was inverted on that day.</p><canvas></canvas><h3>How does this matter as a personal investor?</h3><p>One way to use the yield curve is to check whether it is inverted. If the yield curve is inverted, postpone taking any loans if you can. An inverted yield curve is a sign that the rates might be lower in the future, so you'd want to wait for that to happen. It's also a sign that there might be economic trouble ahead; so ensure your savings are truly safe.</p><p>The yield curve can help you identify opportunities to refinance old mortgages or loans. If interest rates have dropped since the day you took the loan, you might have an opportunity to refinance it at a lower interest rate.</p><p>The yield curve doesn't change frequently; check it once per quarter.</p><h2>How does it change?</h2><h3>The Federal Reserve manages parts of the yield curve.</h3><p>The Fed's job is to manage inflation and maintain economic growth. They use a variety of tools to do so. For the moment, don't worry about how the Fed does it - just know that the Fed has lots of control over short term rates, but only some control over long term rates.</p><p>During a recession the Fed's goal is to get the economy growing again. In order to do so, it will cut interest rates. As explained above, high interest rates reduce spending, while low interest rates stimulate spending. When spending is stimulated, the economy grows, and things eventually return back to normal.</p><p>The Fed is good at its job, and is reliable, so the relationship described above works well. So well, that investors know the Fed will do so when a recession hits. If investors think a recession is coming 2 years from now, they'll start betting that interest rates will drop. This in fact causes <strong>yield rates</strong> to fall, resulting in an inverted yield curve. </p><p>But there are limits to what the Fed can actually do.</p><h3>What's happening during COVID-19?</h3><p>The yield curve is considered extremely flat today. The chart below shows the spread between 30 day and 30 year bonds. The lower the spread, the flatter the yield curve.</p><p>The Fed has committed to keeping interest rates as as close to 0 as possible. COVID-19 has hit the economy hard; low interest rates are needed to stimulate the economy as much as possible, but the Fed might be hitting its limits.</p><h3>What could the future look like?</h3><p>There's a notion of the <em>Zero Lower Bound</em>. Theoretically, interest rates can't drop below 0%. Negative interest rates are weird - that implies being paid to take out a loan. For a long time, it was assumed that the bound was a hard one. Meaning that once the Fed has cut interest rates to 0%, it can't do anything more to stimulate the economy.</p><p>Firstly, we've discovered that 0% might not be the lower bound. European central banks, such as the Swiss central bank, have run interest rates lower than 0% for some time now.</p><p>Secondly, the Fed has discovered new tools to stimulate the economy. A notable example is Quantitative Easing, first used in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has started to do it again; but this time around, the effects have been very different. To be explained in a future post!</p><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2><p>The Fed is one of many interacting agents in the world of interest rates; we haven't discussed inflation or gone into details about the role that investors play.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <div>
    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>This isn’t going to be a post about how adopting a several-thousand-year-old practice <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/healthy-living/mindfulness-sells-buddhist-meditation-teachings-neoliberalism-attention-economy-a8225676.html">can make you a better servant of capital</a>.
Instead, let’s talk about when I feel the lowest of the low.
It comes after spending any number of hours on my computer, maybe even a full day, endlessly circling around different websites in search of stimulation, the quick jolt that comes with learning an interesting fact or watching a funny short video or seeing someone get dunked on for having a bad political opinion.
I’ll eventually wake into a state that could be identified as conscious thought, look back on the many (genuinely exciting!) things I wanted to learn or do that day, and contrast it with what I actually did.
What did I actually do? I honestly don’t even know. I doubt I could list even three things I’d read or experienced the entire preceding eight hours.
At this moment I feel very bad. I know one of the ~30,000 days in my life is gone.
And I didn’t get anything out of it.
Actually, I’m worse off, because spending your time in this way just begets even more time spent in this way.</p>
<p>I don’t have any social media apps on my phone.
I deleted my twitter account.
I deleted my reddit account.
I don’t have an instagram account.
My facebook account exists only to be part of some groups.
I use LeechBlock.
I redirect websites to 0.0.0.0 in my hosts file.
Everyone I know does most of these things.
Everyone I know still has trouble spending their time how they actually want to spend it.
If I were to write down a list of the things I find most important in life, endlessly circling around a handful of websites would not even be in consideration.</p>
<p>If I get stuck in the loop for more than a week or so my brain starts to eat itself.
There’s a visceral knawing feeling.
My thoughts dwell on how to defeat this thing which is deleting hours from my life.</p>
<p>So far the only thing which has helped is mindfulness meditation.
After sitting for 10 or 20 minutes and focusing on my breath, my mind becomes quiet.
Traffic on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network">default mode network</a> dies down a little bit.
I’m no longer instantly pulled into the online vortex upon encountering the slightest speedbump in my work.
Instead my mind just… stays quiet, and I keep the problem in my head.
This doesn’t last forever.
I could probably meditate for 10 minutes out of every hour and still have spent more time on the things I actually wanted to spend time on, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deciding to meditate is hard.
The idea of spending ten minutes intentionally doing nothing runs against a lot of messaging I’ve internalized.
It’s also very difficult to keep my attention on my breath instead of running away to consider whatever figment wanders through my thoughts.
There’s an interesting metaphor I’ve heard.
Your mind is like a train station.
Thoughts think themselves - they are trains pulling into the station.
A train of thought will shortly pull out of the station, but you don’t have to be on it.
Or maybe you just boarded it without thinking, then don’t realize what you’ve done until you’re a mile down the track.
No worries; you can always return to the station.</p>
<p>I decided to try mindfulness meditation after listening to the audio version of Robert Wright’s book <a href="http://whybuddhismistrue.net/">Why Buddhism Is True</a> while on a cross-country drive.
It’s about how many beliefs in Buddhism - specifically Western Atheistic Buddhism - have support from modern psychology &amp; neuroscience.
I wasn’t motivated to start meditating by thinking it would help me in this struggle for my attention; the discovery was quite accidental.
I use the <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/">Waking Up</a> app.
Friends of mine also report good experiences with <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.</p>
<p>It’s troubling I have to go to such lengths to live my life the way I think I want to live it.
Maybe this struggle is uniquely modern, maybe it’s one for the ages.
I still have issues sometimes, especially before bed when my defenses are lower and I can get sucked into the loop instead of reading a good book or just going to sleep.
Still, for the first time in my life I’ve found an actually effective tool for resisting the attention economy.</p>

<p>I got this email from Linkedin this morning. It is telling me that they are going to change my location from “<strong>Auckland, New  Zealand</strong>” to “<strong>Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand</strong>“. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="496" height="512" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26.png 496w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-33-26-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"><figcaption>Email from Linkedin on 30 August 2020</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since “Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand” sounds stupid to New Zealanders (Auckland is pretty much a big city with a single job market and is not a state or similar) I clicked on the link and opened the application to stick with what I currently have</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="557" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46.png 912w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-300x183.png 300w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-36-46-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px"></figure>



<p>Except the problem is that the pulldown doesn’t offer many any other locations</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="316" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03.png 546w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-38-03-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></figure>



<p>The only way to change the location is to click “use Current Location” and then allow Linkedin to access my device’s location.</p>



<div><p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/suggested/110568">the help page</a>:</p><p><em>By default, the location on your profile will be suggested based on the postal code you provided in the past, either when you set up your profile or last edited your location. However, you can manually update the location on your LinkedIn profile to display a different location.</em></p></div>



<p>but it appears the manual method is disabled. I am guessing they have a fixed list of locations in my postcode and this can’t be changed.</p>



<p>So it appears that my options are to accept Linkedin’s crappy name for my location (Other NZers have posted problems with their location naming) or to allow Linkedin to spy on my location and it’ll probably still assign the same dumb name.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="42" src="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43.png 489w, https://blog.darkmere.gen.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-30-12-48-43-300x26.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></figure>



<p>The basically appears to be a way for Linkedin to push user to enable location tracking. While at the same time they get to force their own ideas on how New Zealand locations work on users.</p>

<p>PHP has a Just In Time compiler (JIT) since its most recent major version, PHP 8.</p>
<p>Here's a demo of JIT's impact on PHP. The video was recorded by Zeev, a core
developer of the php engine, to demonstrate the performance difference between
php 7.0 and JIT when generating fractals.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""><iframe style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWH65pmnsrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It is fair to expect great performance improvements after watching this video,
especially if you remember the amazing boost when migrating from php 5 to 7.
But soon you'll notice that such gains aren't for most applications (unless
you do fractals for a living 🤷🏻‍♀️).</p>
<p>So before you get too hyped or too disappointed about JIT, let me explain what
this thing is and how you can get the most out of it.</p>
<h2>What is a Just In Time compiled language and why do we need it?</h2>
<p>Let me introduce you to compilation first, I believe we will need it.</p>
<p>CPUs can't read english, you already know that. They can kind of read a series
of bits and bytes which represent addresses, values, instructions... But guess
who can't code this? That's right, us! (At least I can't 👀 (I kind of can, but... no.))</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to translate something we, humans, can write into
something CPUs can execute. This translation can be called "compilation". So
<strong>compilation is a translation of human-readable code to machine code.</strong>
Simple, oder?</p>
<p>Translating human-readable code to machine code can happen in three different
ways: Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation, Just In Time (JIT) compilation or, our
favorite, interpretation (or Implicit Compilation).</p>
<p><strong>Languages like C, C++ or Rust are AOT-compiled languages.</strong> You write the code,
you compile it and the output is a binary object that a CPU immediately understands
how to execute. It is called Ahead Of Time because you compile the binary object
BEFORE you run it.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like PHP, Java or JavaScript are interpreted.</strong> A code written in such
languages will be translated into an intermediate representation and another
program (a compiled one) will understand and execute such intermediate
representation. It is very common to call such programs "Virtual Machines" or
"Interpreters".</p>
<p><strong>Normally interpreted languages have less performance and freedom when compared
with AOT-compiled languages</strong> because things like memory management, CPU-targeted
instructions and funky low-level tricks are not available to the user space. So
another program (the interpreter) has to manage all of this plus be polyglot
enough to talk to different kinds of processors and operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>Languages like Java, LUA and now PHP are not only interpreted but also Just
In Time compiled!</strong> They still need a VM, but their VMs are capable of compiling
this intermediate representation of code into binary objects in runtime. These
JIT-capable VMs operate in a hybrid mode where code is partially compiled and interpreted.</p>
<p>When JIT kicks in, parts of your php code will be compiled into machine code so the
Zend VM (php's virtual machine) won't interpret these parts anymore. Your php
code will talk directly to the CPU.</p>
<p>So why can't we just compile everything, then? If the VM is a bottleneck, why
bother to run through it in the first place? We could just compile our php code
into machine code and be happy about it.</p>
<p>Well, we'd have to compile to specific CPU architectures, be prepared to talk to
different operating systems, be extremely clear about our variable types and
perform way more bare-metal operations than we should if we want to be productive.
There are decent abstractions for Golang and Rust, for example, but they aren't
very practical and require control over the environment they're deployed against.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreted languages, on the other hand, can be easily deployed to different
servers, allow rapid development and create room for dynamic typing systems.</strong></p>
<p>Just In Time compilation is potentially the best of the two worlds, combining
good speed and developer experience.</p>
<p>Dynamic typing, as you know, is one of the core features of PHP. It is very
complex and is tattooed into php's core in a way that removing the dynamic
typing is almost unthinkable.
<a href="https://thephp.website/en/issue/php-type-system/">Here’s a great summary on how php’s type system works.</a></p>
<p>And because of Dynamic Typing (and some other things you'll learn about below)
the Just In Time compiler present in PHP is not yielding big performance gains.
At least not yet.</p>
<p>Curious why? Keep reading!</p>
<h2>Let's see how PHP works with and without JIT</h2>
<p>In PHP there are three steps before executing your code: <strong>tokenizing</strong>,
<strong>parsing</strong> into an AST and <strong>compiling</strong> to an intermediate representation
known as <strong>Opcode</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tokenizing (or Lexing) is the process of reading php code and splitting
it into understandable units called tokens.</strong> <code>&lt;?php</code> becomes a _T_OPEN<em>TAG</em>,
<code>echo</code> becomes a _T<em>ECHO</em> and <code>"Hello, friend"</code> becomes T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING.
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/tokens.php">A complete list of PHP's tokens can be found here.</a></p>
<p>Parsing is the process of making sense out of such tokens. In PHP parsed tokens
are organized in a tree structure named AST (Abstract syntax tree).
The AST's job is to represent what operations should be. In <code>echo 1+1</code> the interpreter
should in fact understand <code>print the result of the expression 1+1</code>. Such tree would
look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>operation =&gt; ECHO,
operand =&gt; expression (
    operation =&gt; ADD,
    operand1 =&gt; 1,
    operand2 =&gt; 1
)</code></pre>
<p>PHP is then able to <strong>compile this tree into an intermediate representation
called Opcode.</strong></p>
<p>The Opcode is what is actually executed by the virtual machine, so executing
is the final step. Here's a diagram illustrating how this process looks like.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>A simplified overview on PHP's interpreting flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You probably realized that tokenizing, parsing and compiling code every single time
can be a big bottleneck. PHP engineers thought so too and that's why the
Opcache extension exists. Let's have a quick look at it.</p>
<h2>The Opcache extension</h2>
<p>The Opcache extension is shipped with PHP and generally there's no big reason to
deactivate it. If you use PHP, you should probably have Opcache switched on.</p>
<p>It adds an in-memory shared cache layer to store Opcodes. So tokenizing, parsing
and compiling will happen once for each file and will be shared with every request.</p>
<p>With Opcache extension enabled, the execution of PHP code looks like in the following
diagram:</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" target="_blank">
<img src="https://thephp.website/assets/images/posts/10-php-8-jit/zendvm-opcache.png" alt="The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache">
</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with Opcache. If a file was already parsed, php fetches the cached Opcodes for it instead of parsing all over again.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> this is where <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/preload">PHP 7.4's preloading feature</a>
shines! It allows you to tell PHP FPM to parse your codebase, transform it into
Opcodes and cache them even before you execute anything.</p>
<h2>Enters the Just In Time compilation</h2>
<p>While the Opcache extension will prevent PHP from tokenizing, parsing and compiling
over and over again, the Just In Time compilation aims to skip the virtual machine's
Opcode interpretation and let it execute machine code directly.</p>
<p>PHP's JIT implementation uses a C library called
<a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM (Dynamic Assembler)</a>
which maps a set of CPU instructions in one specific format into assembly code for
many different CPU types. So the Just In Time compiler transforms Opcodes into an
architecture-specific machine code using DynASM.</p>
<p>The compilation happens between fetching Opcodes from cache and executing them.
Since compiling Opcode into machine code can be very expensive, PHP has to decide
which portions of your code might make sense to be compiled or not.</p>
<p><strong>PHP then profiles Opcodes being executed by the Zend VM and checks which ones
might make sense to compile. (based on your configuration)</strong></p>
<p>When an Opcode is compiled its execution doesn't happen through the Zend VM handlers,
they are directly executed by the CPU.</p>
<figure>

</a>
<figcaption>The PHP's interpreting flow with JIT. If compiled, Opcodes don't execute through the Zend VM.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an Opcode should be compiled is decided based on your INI configurations. You'll
get more details in the next section.</p>
<h2>JIT Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuring JIT in PHP is very simple, there are two INI directives we need to set:
<code>opcache.jit_buffer_size</code> and <code>opcache.jit</code>. The first indicates how much memory
we're willing to allocate for compiled code, while the later one dictates how JIT
should behave.</p>
<p>There's also an optional directive named <code>opcache.jit_debug</code> for debugging purposes.
I will not cover this one here.</p>
<p>For example, the snippet below indicates that we're willing to give up to 100 Megabytes
of compiled code, enabling AVX instruction generation, using a global linear-scan register
allocator, profiling each request and jitting hot functions, optimizing the compiled
code based on static type inference. (👀 WUT?)</p>
<pre><code>opcache.jit_buffer_size=100M
opcache.jit=1235</code></pre>
<p>To make your life easier, I’m bringing some presets that
<a href="https://beberlei.de/2020/07/05/what_to_look_out_for_when_testing_php_jit.html">Benjamin Eberlei kindly shared in his blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1205</code> (JIT everything)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1235</code> (JIT hot code based on relative usage)</li>
<li><code>opcache.jit=1255</code> (trace hot code for JITability, the best so far)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>opcache.jit</code> entry is a sequence of values named "CRTO", each character can have different
behavioural effect on your application. Below I explain what each of these letters can do:</p>
<p><strong>C - CPU-specific optimization</strong></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>

<p>
Has anyone else ever thought about why so many engineers are also
active amateur radio operators? My theory is that there's just so much
passion for the science and practical use of these complex electronic
systems! We enjoy the problems, challenges and solutions so much that
we want to find other ways outside of work to find those same
experiences. In this case, I've got a story that starts with some
amateur radio equipment but comes full-circle to address an extremely
common design issue.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Attempted QSO
</h2>
<p>
This all begins with a new radio. I recently installed the
FTM-3200DR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, a 2m-band, 65W transceiver with Yaesu's digital C4FM
modulation. One of the first things I wanted to try with this radio
was a direct, simplex QSO<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> with a friend who is about 16 miles
away as the crow flies. Unfortunately for propagation, we've got a
decent amount of hilly terrain up here in the Skylands region of New
Jersey in addition to this being the summer season with significant
foliage.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After setting up the radio, I had one more crucial component before we
could attempt the exchange… the antenna! I considered making one
from scratch, but eventually settled on the Arrow OSJ (open-stub
J-pole)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>. This antenna had excellent ratings and reviews for a
low cost. It's also sold as a dual band (2m and 70cm) if I ever
decided to take advantage of that capability. Originally, my plan was
to install the antenna in the attic (after performing all safety
calculations)<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>. After thinking about it though, I noticed the old
satellite dish mounted on the roof which hadn't been touched since we
moved in and decided on that location instead. 
</p>
<p>
One motivation in selecting this antenna was its omni-directional
propagation<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>. Despite the idea of using this radio to communicate
with one friend, I still held high high the importance of an
omni-directional station. As I was installing the OSJ antenna, I
realized that it's not a perfectly symmetrical design - should I
orient the driven element in the direction of desired propagation, or
the opposite? I decided that it was time for an electromagnetic
analysis! Of course, I had these thoughts while on the roof, and
mounted the antenna with my best guess.
</p>

</figure>


<h2 id="headline-2">
Open-Stub J-Pole Analysis
</h2>
<p>
Once down from the roof, I began my analysis. There are some free
simulators out there that use the NEC<sup><a id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> on one end of the
(electromagnetic?)  spectrum. At the other end are the
enterprise-level RF design tools such as Microwave Office<sup><a id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>,
ADS<sup><a id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup>, and Ansys<sup><a id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup>. Did you know that it doesn't take a full
RF design software license to get a good idea of antenna performance?
Even just an SI/PI analysis suite such as Cadence Sigrity can get us
what we need. The Sigrity 3DEM license along with 3D Workbench<sup><a id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup>
provides a perfect environment to quickly model arbitrary 3-D geometry
and determine parameters such as resonant frequency, VSWR/S11, and
far-field radiation patterns. It may not automatically give detailed
results such as efficiency or directivity but it's plenty to give an
idea of behavior and allows the designer an opportunity to modify a
design to meet any project requirements. 
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 3. OSJ model, UHF connector detail.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The antenna was simulated as if mounted to a 100" insulated pole. The
range of 100 MHz to 500 MHz was selected in order to ascertain
behavior in both the 2m and 70cm bands. The UHF connector<sup><a id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> was
originally modeled, but I realized that I didn't have accurate
dimensions of the SO-239 stud or coupling nut, and I wouldn't want to
introduce reflections which are not representative of the antenna
structure itself.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Results
</h3>
<p>
The results confirmed exactly what some reviews have stated:
performance is slightly worse in the 70cm band. S11 (converted to
VSWR) does indicate this, with a best-case SWR of 1.2 in the 70cm
band, and 1.1 in the 2m band.
</p>

            <p><em>Figure 5. OSJ VSWR.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One of the most interesting things about this analysis is that the
center frequency for both bands is quite a bit different from what is
reported. The Arrow SWR chart<sup><a id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> shows the 2m band coverage from
142-150 MHz and the 70cm from 430-453 MHz. Our analysis shows the 2m
band covering 136-142 MHz and the 70cm band covering 404-414 MHz -
both lower than expected. This should be confirmed with an antenna
analyzer, though one is not currently available to make the
measurement. Interesting to note - I'm not the first person to notice
these discrepancies when simulating against the instruction manual's
dimensions<sup><a id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup>. I did make a point to measure the antenna and each
element was within 1/4" of the stated dimensions. That made me even
more eager to get an analyzer on it to test its actual response. At
that point, I tweaked the model to match measurements and ensure the
feed point is modeled correctly. For now though - the goal is simply
to determine propagation directionality which I'll analyze in the next
section.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Far Field Propagation
</h4>
<p>
Finally, we arrive at my ultimate goal - determining whether or not
propagation is truly omni-directional! The fastest way to check this
out is to look at the far field propagation plots. For reference,
Fig. 6 shows the orientation of the antenna in relation to the
axes. We are specifically looking for any directivity at all in the
antenna. All plots will indicate the frequency of interest, and every
plot was generated with a 1V source (13 dBm) and field strength is
simulated at a distance of 3m.
</p>
<figure>

            <p><em>Figure 6. Antenna orientation.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
First, I'll present an isometric view of the propagation pattern. It's
important to note that the units are given in mV/m for the 3D plots,
but dBuV/m for the 2D plots to follow. This makes the magnitude of
variation seem greater in the 3D plots, but we can probe for specific
values on the 2D plots. (Click any of the propagation plots for a
larger view).
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_139m_iso.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, isometric view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The isometric view is the first indication that we aren't looking at
purely omni-directional propagation. As fun as the 3D views are to
look at, we can get the specific difference with a 2D plot.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff2d_139m_z.png" alt="Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0)." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 7. Far field, 139 MHz, top-down cut on the XY-plane (Z=0).</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
As it turns out, there is a minor difference in propagation depending
on the angle ɸ. The maximum value at ɸ=180° is 114.4 dBuV/m,
and the minimum value at ɸ=0° is 112.4 dBuV/m. It would be nice
to represent this as a dBi difference. Using an online
calculator<sup><a id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> (they're always right of course!) we can determine
the gain of the antenna in dBi. In this case, we see a gain of 6.2 dBi
in the forward direction and 4.2 dBi in the backward direction for a 2
dB front-to-back ratio. Coincidentally, this was my guess while on the
roof and was the orientation I used while mounting the antenna. This
may not be extremely significant but it's worth knowing while mounting
the antenna.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, there's even more directivity at 70cm, although that
won't matter for me and my 2m-only radio. 
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/ff_410m_z.png" alt="Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view." width="400"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 8. Far field, 410 MHz, top-down view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
The bottom-line answer to my original question is that if you really
need to squeak out every last bit of gain in a certain direction, then
you'd be better off mounting the J-pole with the driven element closer
to that desired direction.
</p>
<p>
One last thing - if anyone is looking at more simulations or
measurements, here's the Touchstone<sup><a id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> file for this simulation which can
be downloaded and compared. Let me know if you use it!

</ul>
<h4 id="headline-5">
What about that QSO?
</h4>
<p>
As of publication my friend and I have yet to close the link on a
successful exchange. This could be due to any number of factors, but I
was able to make contact with another ham via a repeater located 30
miles from my QTH<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, so the reasonable assumption is that the antenna
system on my roof is operating well.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-6">
PCB antenna
</h2>
<p>
While analysis of ham radio antennas is an interesting pursuit, it
caused me to stop and consider more practical applications of this
software. One thing that really struck me was the huge rise in IoT
devices using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and many other wireless
communication protocols. How can a designer be assured their antenna
will work as required? Sure, copying dimensions from datasheets or
other resources might be adequate but for optimal performance on the
first fab run, a simulation would be very helpful. As an example, I've
chosen a common antenna design and show how quick and easy it is to simulate
and validate prior to fabrication.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-7">
Antenna Selection
</h3>
<p>
Cypress has an excellent document<sup><a id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> describing antenna and RF
design. Even better, they have links to PCB designs of a few antennas
which can be adapted to a designer's board. I chose to import and
simulate their MIFA (Meandered Inverted-F Antenna).
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/mifa_3d.png" alt="Figure 9. MIFA 3D view." width="400"> <figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 9. MIFA 3D view.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
Prior to beginning the simulation we must determine the PCB stackup
and materials used. Fortunately the linked design files include a
fabrication drawing which indicates a finished PCB thickness of
62mils. The material is listed as generic FR-4, so we'll use one of
the most common FR-4 materials available: Isola 370HR<sup><a id="footnote-reference-18" href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup>. 
</p>
<p>
Next, the board design must be imported into the simulation tool of
choice. In this case, I'll bring the .brd file into PowerSI 3D-EM in
order to tweak the stackup. From there, we'll save it as a .spd and
bring that into 3D Workbench.
</p>

Initial Simulation
</h3>
<p>
The first simulation shows that this board must have been designed
specifically for manual adjustment given the resonant frequency is 2.1
GHz (see Fig. 11 below). …</p></div></div>

    <p>The aim of this guide is to make you more comfortable with git without having to read a whole book.
I will do this by giving you more of an “inside tour” of the inner workings of git.</p>

<p>If you are curious and want to become more comfortable with git, this guide aims to satisfy your curiosity more than “traditional” git guides.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll learn enough here to use git with more confidence, and will know better where to look when you are stuck.</p>

<p>Git is a computer program that creates snapshots – essentially backups – of folders on your computer.
In git, these snapshots are called “commits”.
A commit contains everything in that folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The folder structure</li>
  <li>names of files</li>
  <li>contents of files</li>
  <li>metadata of files</li>
</ul>

<p>Git’s strengths come from how it organizes the commits and from all the commands it provides for manipulating, labelling, and comparing them.
Handling commits is what makes git a “Version Control System”.</p>

<p>Git tries to make it <em>very</em> easy to take backups so that you can always find a useful place to return to if needed. Also, having a detailed commit history can help answer questions about the state of things at different points in the past, and about why changes were made. Each commit has info about when it was created, and by whom, as well as a “commit message” written by the committer, which ideally contains important information about why it exists.</p>

<p>Git also has commands for collaborating with others (e.g. push/pull/fetch).
The collaboration essentially means exchanging commits and “branches” (which in git are just labels for commits).
Usually collaboration means sending them to a server where others can retrieve them, but it’s also possible to share them directly with other collaborators.<sup id="fnref:distributed"><a href="#fn:distributed">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>

<p>Download git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/">https://git-scm.com/download/</a></p>

<p>Git is usually used from the command line, but there are also other ways to use it (<code>git gui</code>, SourceTree, TortoiseGit to name a few.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/">Here is a big list of graphical user interfaces for git</a>).</p>

<p>To download an existing repository (for example the one for this blog), run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/oyvn/oyvn.github.io.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To create your own repository in an existing folder, run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git init                      # Creates the repository
git add .                     # Prepares a commit of whatever was in
                              # the folder.
git commit -m"Initial commit" # Stores the commit with the message
                              # "Initial commit"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-repository">The repository</h2>

<p>A “repository” (repo) is a collection of commits.
When you use <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init"><code>git init</code></a> to create a repo inside a folder, git adds a hidden folder called “.git” inside it. The .git folder is where it puts all the commits.</p>

<p>The rest of your folder is now referred to as the “working directory”.</p>

<p>When you create a commit, git stores all the files and folders as “objects” in the .git folder.
Together, the stored objects contain all the information necessary to recreate the contents of the working directory.</p>

<p>When you retrieve a repo with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git clone</code></a>, git essentially retrieves the .git folder and recreates – “checks out” – the working directory from the objects.</p>

<p>There are a few different types of git objects, let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2 id="the-objects---commit-tree-and-blob">The objects - commit, tree and blob</h2>

<p>In git, everything is files.
All objects are stored as files in the .git repo.
Objects have different types depending on what data they contain.
An object’s file name is usually a string of gibberish that serves as a unique reference to that object.</p>

<p>When you call <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit</code></a>, git creates a “commit” object, as well as “tree” objects for each folder, and “blob” objects for each file in the snapshot.
The blob is the simplest, it’s just a copy of the file, except for the name, which is a gibberish reference instead.</p>

<p>If you look in <code>.git/objects</code> you will find all commit, tree, and blob objects in your repo, all with gibberish names.</p>

<p>By not associating objects with file or folder names, the object can be reused even if the name or location of a file or folder changes, as long as the contents remain unchanged.</p>

<p>A tree object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name and a reference for every immediate sub-folder. The reference is to a tree object describing the sub-folder’s contents.</li>
  <li>The name and a reference for every file in the folder. The reference is to a blob object with the file contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>A commit object contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The committer and author (That’s you, if you made the commit – your name and email address as configured via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config"><code>git config</code></a>).</li>
  <li>The current date and time.</li>
  <li>The commit message that you authored in the process of committing.</li>
  <li>A reference to the tree object for the working directory.</li>
  <li>One or more references to other commit objects (“parent commits”).</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I want you to notice a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each commit points to a parent.
This means the commit can be understood as building on something that came before it.</li>
  <li>Even though a commit is thought of as a <em>change</em>, or <em>difference</em> (also called a “delta”), it is stored by git as a standalone snapshot.
Any information about what change it represents is computed when needed, by comparing commits.</li>
  <li>Because objects are referred to by reference, any time an object already exists git just refers to the existing object.
So when your commit only changes one file, only one new blob object (and at least one tree object) needs to be created.</li>
  <li>Retrieving any object by its reference just means finding a file with a certain name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Objects are described in depth in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">Git Internals</a> chapter of the free Pro Git Book.
I recommend it if you are curious, it’s where I learned this.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a closer look at the unique gibberish reference (“hash”).</p>

<h2 id="references-the-hash">References (the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hash</a>”)</h2>
<p>This section might be heavy, but keep going, it gets to the heart of many of git’s quirks.</p>

<p>In git, there are hashes everywhere, displayed as long strings of numbers and letters.
All objects have hashes, but you mostly see commit hashes, for example when you run <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log"><code>git log</code></a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://oyvn.github.io/assets/git-log.png" alt="git log" title="git log output."></p>
<p>git log output from this blog’s repo.</p>

<p>The hash is calculated from the contents of a given object, and is  completely unique to that object.
It’s often called the “sha” of the commit, because the hash is of the type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">sha1</a>.</p>

<p>A hash (or “digest”) is a big number which always a certain length.
For sha1, the length is 160 bits, or 20 bytes<sup id="fnref:sha1_finite"><a href="#fn:sha1_finite">3</a></sup>.
In git, these bytes are always displayed as a text string of 40 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> characters (0-9, a-f)<sup id="fnref:sha_length"><a href="#fn:sha_length">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The hash is created by taking the data (the input) and doing some convoluted math on it.
The input can be any data, of any length.
In git, objects serve as inputs.</p>

<p>The convoluted math is such that the hash follows some very strict rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The length of the hash is the same regardless of the length of the input.</li>
  <li>The hash is always the same every time if the input is the same.</li>
  <li>The hash is always <em>completely</em> different if the input is even <em>slightly</em> different, even if a single bit is changed, added or removed.</li>
  <li>Finding an input for a given hash (i.e. calculating the hash backwards) is impossible.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>sha1("a"):
    86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8
sha1("To die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    0855319deffa58b0458c29edeaa8d6a120d44f35
sha1("to die, to sleep - to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub, for in this sleep of death what dreams may come"):
    cab29b74b98c3ad638fe9c1abed72be40d69badc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some example SHA1 hashes.</p>

<p>From these rules, we can realize that if <em>any</em> data in an object changes, it is no longer the same object, because the reference will be completely different.
That includes if the time changes by just one second in a commit, or a file changes by just one byte, or if a folder name changes slightly.</p>

<p>It also means that the changes must propagate.
If a file changes, its reference changes, so the tree containing the reference changes, and the commit containing the tree changes.</p>

<p>Any commits descended from the commit must also change.
In fact, looking backwards in time, a commit hash uniquely identifies not just the commit, but also, through its parents and grandparents etc., the entire git history - every tree, blob, and commit - up until that commit. If any detail in any place in the history was different, the current commit would not be the same commit since its hash would be different.</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>Ok. Time for a short story about something slightly different.</p>

<h2 id="intermission-index">Intermission: Index</h2>

<p>When creating a commit, you might want to limit the difference from the previous commit.
You’ll want to group changes in a logical way, to make the commit easier to describe, and to reason about later.</p>

<p>You might have done many changes, though, since the last commit.
Git helps in this situation by allowing you to “stage” changes before commiting them.
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add"><code>git add</code></a> adds files to the “index” i.e. stages them, i.e. marks them as “to be committed”.</p>

<p>When you create the commit, only the staged files and folders receive new objects, the rest are stored as unchanged.</p>

<p>Git creates trees and blobs from the files as you stage them, so that <code>git commit</code> just needs to create a commit object which references the tree created for the index.</p>

<p>The index often confuses people, but at this point in the guide it might be interesting to realize the similarities between the index and a commit.</p>

<p>Now for the story.</p>

<p>I once mistakenly deleted a new file I had been working on, losing several hours of work since I hadn’t committed it (commit often, people!).
But I remembered that I had staged it at one point, so I knew a blob object was created.
I managed to search the files in my .git folder for a phrase present in the lost file, and I found the file.
The blob …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>The term JAMStack is meant to define a technology stack that relies heavily on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It also is meant to mean a whole lot more than that. In this article, we will explore how this concept is being expressed on the web.</p>
<p>
<span>J</span>avaScript<br>
<span>A</span>PIs<br>
<span>M</span>arkup<br>
<span>Stack</span><br>
</p><p>You may be thinking to yourself, JavaScript, microservices exposed via APIs, and of course markup make up most websites these days. How is JAMStack not just describing the web in 2020? When you google "JAMStack" you may see an ad for a <a href="https://jamstack.io/">portable electric apm</a>, but you will also see a result for <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack.org</a>. JAMStack.org is a nice resource that the folks over at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> have created in order to help codify a set of standards around an emerging trend in how websites can be built. Let's begin with the first definition listed on JAMStack.org</p>
<p>
        <span>“</span>
        Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.
    </p>

<p>This statement does not do a great job of picking apart the JAM in JAMStack but does do a good job of leading with some value propositions, techniques, and specific technologies that are hallmarks of JAMStack. Let's pick this apart 2005 style with a tag cloud.</p>
<p><span>Fast</span>
    <span>CDN</span>
    <span>Secure</span>
    <span>Pre-rendering</span>
    <span>No servers</span>
    <span>Sites</span>
    <span>Apps</span>
</p>

<p>I have given what I believe to be the proper weight to each of these key words that help make up JAMStack, but before we dig into them, let's start from the beginning of sorts. Here is <a href="https://simple-jamstack.netlify.app/">an exmaple of a JAMStack site</a>.</p>


<p>This site simply takes the last 5 movie picks from the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview">NYTimes Movies API</a>, renders them and adds an ability to vote on which films seem interesting and uninteresting via the <a href="https://formcake.com/api">Formcake API</a>. You could build this project in any number of stacks, but what makes this a JAMStack site? You can follow along in more detail using the public <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">repo</a>. Below we will go into some of these key aspects around JAMStack in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="pre-rending">Pre-rending</h2>
<p>One of the most important and talked about aspects of JAMStack is that projects are depoyed as static builds. It is a bit of a debate within the community on whether something must be statically built and hosted to be JAMStack but most JAMStack specific tooling is built around the idea of static builds. For those who are unfamiliar with this term, a static build simply means that a site or app is entirely or partially generated as flat files for serving. Those flat files are then returned to the user upon request as opposed to a server rendering them. The project could also be decribed as "Pre-rendered" since some or all of the site has been build ahead of time. When a change occurs to the content of a JAMStack site, you must rebuild it and serve the new flat files. A slice of a review website's static file structure may look like the following.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Url</th>
<th>Static File</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>/</td>
<td>index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies</td>
<td>/movies/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/index.html</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet</td>
<td>/movies/reviews/tenet/index.html</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<pre><code>
index.html
movies/
    index.html
    reviews/
        index.html
        tenet/
            index.html

</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Formcake/simple-jamstack">sample movie interest project</a> utilizes pre-rendering with the help of <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. Eleventy is a fantastic way to get started with static sites because it is extremely flexible and can grow with your project.</p>
<h2 id="no-servers">No Servers</h2>
<p>Like the term serverless, this is a bit of a misnomer. Of course JAMStack sites are served by a server. The preferred server stack however is one that is specifically designed to only deliver static files like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a>. There are many benefits to be gained from taking this approach. One of those is stability. When you choose a system like S3 to host your website, you are making many concessions. You have no control over the operating system, the software installed on the server, or even the choice of http server technology. The benefit however is that none of those are of any concern when you are doing something as simple as serving a static file. All of those decisions and layers of complexity are manged and run at enourmous levels at scale by AWS. This makes it very unlikely that your site will go down because those layers of complexity can be highly optimized when used for one purpose. The sample project does not use a custom server because it is hosted on Netlify. Netlify is designed around hosting static files and therefore is highly optimized for this purpose.</p>
<h2 id="cdn">CDN</h2>
<p>The next layer of hosting for a JAMStack site is the use of a CDN. A CDN, or content delivery network, is a way of storing snapshots of the pages of your website and distributing those around the world. When a user requests a page your CDN will deliver a cache or vesion of that page instead of your main server. The main benefit of a CDN is that it is the <strong>fastest</strong> way to deliver content and the most <strong>secure</strong> way as well. CDN's can obscure your main server from the world and help protect it from malicious traffic or activity. The sample project utilizes a CDN because it is hosted on Netlify and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/">Netlify uses a CDN</a> to deliver deployed content.</p>
<h2 id="apis">APIs</h2>
<p>You may think that most websites are run via APIs these days and so why point this out. For JAMStack the importance on APIs centers around the fact that by default a JAMStack project does not have a web server to ping for data since a static hosting server is the only implied server in the stack. Many sites and most apps however need a server of some kind to create interactivity and store / access data. In the JAMStack world, it is encouraged that you either find a service with an API that performs an aspect that a server would or create a microservice using lambdas to still be as "serverless" as possible. Hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> both support server like features using lambda functions. In the example application, I kept it simple and used Formcake's API to handle all server side features.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/blog-posts/nytimes-form.png" alt="Creating your token in Formcake"></p>
<p>Formcake allows a form submission through an ajax request and so it was easy to utilize this functionality to allow users to vote on movie picks.</p>
<pre><code>
axios.post('https://api.formcake.com/api/form/4e656bac-5c16-4d5d-be65-eb2928be0179/submission', {
    vote, 
    movieTitle
});

</code></pre>

<p>I could have gone to the trouble of creating a lambda based micro service for the voting mechanic but for simple projects it is far easier to use something off the shelf. This is also part of the JAMStack ethos in a way. It's all about what is possible when you fully decouple the front and backend.</p>
<h2 id="sites-and-apps">Sites and Apps?</h2>
<p>JAMStack.org mentions that JAMStack can be used for both websites and web applications. I agree with this sentiment but I also think that JAMStack is not perfectly suited for many types of applications. If you were to signup for <a href="https://formcake.com/pricing">Formcake's free plan</a> you would notice that most pages load like a server side rendered application. If you go to your /forms page, you will instantly be greeted with your forms. The same is true for an individual form detail page and your account page. This is because we utilize <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">server side rendering technology</a> in order to deliver our site. We feel this to be a requirement for a SaaS application in 2020 because we are beyond the days of having loading wheels for every component on a single page application. It is a bit of an argument in the JAMStack community on whether an SSR application is a JAMStack project. I don't necessarily care because we should all be choosing the best technology for our projects but I feel that it is worth pointing out. This distinction makes JAMStack better suited for static content or sites with light interactivity in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this explanation of JAMStack is helpful to those looking to explore it. It has never been easier to create a powerful website with the pricipals behind JAMStack thanks to hosting platforms like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and tools like <a href="https://formcake.com/">Formcake</a>. As always, if you feel that your project could benefit from JAMStack but does not quite meet the requirements, simply take from JAMStack what improves the project and leave behind what detracts from it. This is how we built Formcake and we are very pleased with the results.</p>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>You haven’t quite figured out HTTP2 yet that you’re already starting to get pissed off by people talking about HTTP3. But there’s a reason for that: HTTP3 is fast. I bet you in five minutes you’ll agree with me. </p>



<h3>Once upon a time</h3>



<p>I can’t tell you about the future without telling you about the present. <strong>Do you know about HTTP ?</strong> Defined in 1991, it’s the protocol that manages the web. It means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HyperText Transfer Protocol</a> and it allows you to fetch resources from a web page. </p>



<p>From a web server to your browser. It’s built on a lower level protocol –<strong>TCP: it’s going to be important-</strong> and it’s stateless. It means that each request is completely independent. Each GIF present on this page is a GIF proudly independent in its life on the internet. That’s good for him and his life as a GIF. But for us it’s a bit of a broken system.</p>



<p>Because the problem is that <strong>each request will only look for one file at a time</strong>. Each time an expensive TCP connection is created for the occasion. Imagine if you had 10,000 Internet tips on your page.</p>



<p> I know a lot of people absolutely loved my pattern making skills in the previous article. So, to explain the Internets to you properly, I’m doing it again.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/iI0MrHF.jpg" alt="http"></figure></div>



<p>Despite the fact that a browser can make six different requests at the same time, HTTP is still slow and full of TCP connections. Plus, we developers, usualy don’t care about that. <strong>We like to put as much crap on our pages as possible. </strong>Big jQuery lib with 300 useless CSS stylesheets ending with a big transparent 8 mega PNG. </p>



<p>When Google saw all the crap we were doing everywhere <strong>they started talking about SPDY</strong> (it’s called speedy). The point? To speed up the Internets. </p>



<p>SPDY is a specification that proposes to use HTTP as is but with a change of rules. And by <strong>compressing headers, prioritizing requests and multiplexing</strong>, it will transform all TCP requests and connections into one! </p>



<p>Concretely, when your HTML is read, your browser looks at everything you’re going to ask in your page. Then, it’s getting everything all at once. <strong>This way you avoid doing it file by file.</strong> </p>



<p>The first draft of HTTP2 is SPDY based. Very quickly HTTP2 was adopted and life on the internet has become faster. <strong>Today <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-http2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42.7% of the internet</a> use HTTP2.</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/2jePyHC.jpg" alt="http2"></figure></div>



<h3>Great, what about HTTP3?</h3>



<p>If I piss you off with HTTP and HTTP2 when you explicitly clicked to see sexy HTTP3, there’s a good reason. HTTP2 was created by taking HTTP as a base and changing the rules.<strong> It’s the same thing with HTTP3. </strong>So by understanding the present it’s easier for me to explain the future to you.</p>



<p>Googlers are geeks, they never stop. After SPDY became HTTP2, they thought that it was still not fast enough. So they started talking about QUIC (it’s called Quick). <strong>This will be the second experimental technology developed by Google to become an official upgrade of the HTTP protocol</strong>. But what’s so special about this protocol?</p>



<p>The main big evolution of HTTP3 is the change of transport layer. No more of the heavy TCP connections I’ve been telling you about since the beginning. <strong>Now, it’s all about UDP. </strong></p>



<p>By the way QUIC means “Quick UDP Internet Connections”. This change of protocol will speed up connection establishment and data transfer times enormously. Howerver, <strong>UDP is certainly faster and simpler, but it doesn’t have the reliability and error handling of TCP.</strong></p>



<p>TCP has to make several round trips just to establish a connection in a square and stable way. <strong>Where UDP doesn’t give a damn and does it really fast without stability and risk of lost packets. </strong>However UDP can dramatically reduce latency in requests. Up to almost zero latency in repeated connections to the same server because no roundtrip is made to establish connections.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/hDmNkpS.png" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>HTTP3 is the multiplexing and compression features of HTTP2 with a protocol change from TCP to UDP. The Google guys then added their layer in the protocol to guarantee stability, order in the reception of packets and of course security. </p>



<p><strong>So HTTP3 uses UDP for its high speed while keeping the stability of QUIC</strong>, without forgetting the security of TLS. Because yes, in QUIC you find TLS 1.3 which allows you to make your beautiful SSL. I’ve been talking about layers for a while, this is what it looks like under the hood.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QdNsQHL.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/QdNsQHL.jpg" alt="http3"></figure>



<p>In 2018, QUIC became HTTP3. The Internet Enginerring Task Force dudes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;t=4956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>dudes in shorts who decide on Internet protocols</strong></a>, have agreed. And that’s great news because the Internets will never be fast enough for us, impatient people.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>HTTP3 is the sexy future with a HTTP base that has been tuned to the maximum by google geeks. At the time of writing, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-quic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 4.6% of the Internet uses HTTP3</a> but this figure is likely to grow in the coming years. We stayed on the surface today, but there are a lot of deep-dive articles everywhere that I invite you to consult if you’re more curious.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>By Leib Litman, PhD, Zohn Rosen, PhD, Cheskie Rosenzweig, MS, Aaron Moss, PhD, Adam Dietrich, &amp; Jonathan Robinson, PhD</strong></p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Lately, there’s been considerable debate over the accuracy of presidential polls. While recent polls show Joe Biden ahead,&nbsp;a number of pundits speculate that some Donald Trump supporters may be hesitant to share their true opinions when polled by phone. That hypothesis is gaining traction, leading some to argue that Trump may be leading despite what the latest numbers show. It’s also being fueled by the belief that 2020 will be a repeat of the 2016 election, when Trump polled poorly in advance of the election, but still went on to win the Electoral College vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current debate on whether there are segments of Trump (or Biden) backers reticent to express their true opinions in phone polls, there’s been little empirical investigation into if the phenomenon actually exists. Pundits on major broadcast and cable news networks, such as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/does-a-shy-trump-voter-exist-arnon-mishkin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/09/politics/trump-voters-analysis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>, continue to speculate on the potential impact of so-called “shy Trump voters” on the outcome of the November presidential election result.&nbsp; In a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/us/politics/trump-polls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> published in <em>The New York Times</em>, David Winston says the following:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“The idea that people lie, it’s an interesting theory, and it’s not like it’s completely off-the-wall. But it’s obviously a very complicated thing to try to prove because what do you do? Ask them, ‘Are you lying?’”</em></p><p>On its face, a poll that asks people whether they lie in phone polls may not make much&nbsp;sense. After all, why would a person who lies in a telephone poll tell the truth about that in a different online poll? We here at CloudResearch reasoned that the issue may be methodological.</p><p>To explore this issue, we structured our survey to overcome shortcomings of previous polls. Instead of simply asking voters whom they will vote for — and then ask whether they just lied — we centered our research around a general question: “Are you comfortable in truthfully disclosing the presidential candidate you intend to vote for in a telephone poll?” Our rationale for this approach was that there’s a major difference between admitting you just lied and admitting to being genuinely concerned about disclosing your preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, we expected to find very few “shy voters.” After all, telephone surveys are supposed to be anonymous, so why would people be reluctant to share their opinions? However, to the extent people said that they were reluctant to express their voting preferences on a telephone poll, we were interested in their rationale for their reluctance. As a result, we included open-ended follow-up questions to better understand the factors that drive voters to fudge their responses.</p><hr><h2><strong>What CloudResearch Found</strong></h2><ul><li>11.7% of Republicans say they would not report their true opinions about their preferred presidential candidate on telephone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>In contrast, just 5.4% of Democrats say they’d be reluctant to share their true voting intentions — roughly half the number of Republicans reluctant to tell the truth on phone polls.&nbsp;</li><li>10.5% of Independents fell into the “shy voter” category, just a percentage point lower than how Republicans react to phone polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>After asking about people expressing their true opinions on telephone calls, we then inquired about their preferred candidate. This ordering was important as we did not want to fall into the same trap as other pollsters who tend to lead with preference declarations. When we broke the responses down based on current Trump vs Biden supporters, we found the following:</p><ul><li>10.1% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys — double the number of Biden supporters (5.1%) reticent to share their true intentions.</li></ul><p>When respondents indicated that they were untruthful during polls, we followed up to confirm those responses, and then inquired as to why “shy voters” are concerned about sharing their voting intentions. Some example responses are below. These are just a representational sampling of viewpoints that we collected — sentiments not easy to gauge by responses to mere yes/no questions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>“I don’t believe the information would be confidential and I think it’s dangerous to express an opinion outside of the current liberal viewpoint.”</em></p><p><em>“Well I probably wouldn’t give my opinion period, but if pushed, I would not give my real opinion for fear of reprisal if someone found out.”</em></p><p><em>“Because most polls released to the public are slanted and aren’t scientifically based. So, they are messing with the results of the survey from the beginning by knocking down one party or the other. I’m just trying to right the ship.”</em></p><p><em>“I am hounded day and evening by phone solicitors.&nbsp; They interrupt me all the time; sometimes my irritation takes over, and I don’t answer correctly.”</em></p><p><em>“My answers could be recorded so I don’t really trust such phone conversations.”</em></p><p><em>“I do not discuss politics — let alone with a total stranger on the telephone.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t always trust phone call surveys. I wouldn’t want to be bombarded with phone calls and political mail.”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t want my opinion associated with my phone number.”</em></p><p><em>“I am less anonymous, and somewhat ashamed of my opinion as it is frowned upon.”</em></p><hr><h2>In General, “Shy Voters” Cited Six Concerns:&nbsp;</h2><p>1. A lack of trust in phone polls as truly being anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>2. An apprehension to associate their phone numbers with recorded responses.</p><p>3. Fear that their responses will become public in some manner.</p><p>4. Fear of reprisal and related detrimental impact to their financial, social, and family lives should their political opinions become publicly known.&nbsp;</p><p>5. A general dislike of phone polls.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Malicious intent to mislead polls due to general distrust of media and political pundits (though a sentiment expressed only by a few “shy voters”).&nbsp;</p><p>Such concerns were more often than not expressed by Republicans and Independents, and also by those who said they would vote for Donald Trump. Democrats and Biden supporters lagged both groups in terms of being concerned that their voting intentions would be shared with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our survey findings — that show a greater reluctance on the part of Republicans, Independents and Trump voters to disclose their opinions — should not be interpreted as outright lying. Rather, such reluctance seems to stem from a&nbsp; lack of trust in the anonymity of polls and a fear of the consequences if their opinions were to become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The results could have implications in terms of the true accuracy of phone polls; if Republicans, Independents and supporters of Donald Trump (regardless of party affiliation) are less likely to participate in polls or accurately disclose the candidate they support, that inherently generates biased poll outcomes.</p><p>Given razor thin-margins in the swing states, such bias may have important consequences, although more research is required to fully understand the potential magnitude of this effect. We intend to examine the magnitude of “shy-voter bias” in specific states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The results of our survey also illustrate the primary concerns that pollsters may need to address to allay voters about the level of anonymity and privacy of phone polling. We’ll also examine these issues and potential remedies in future research.</p><hr><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Sample&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Interviews were collected from two national online sample waves of 1,000 registered voters (2000 respondents in total), matched to U.S. Census data on gender, age, race, and region. Data were collected August 19 – 27, 2020&nbsp;using&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudresearch.com%2Fproducts%2Fprime-panels%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudResearch’s Prime Panels</a>, a platform that incorporates data quality checks in sample recruitment and sources participants from an aggregate of market research panels (<a target="_blank" href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.3758%2Fs13428-019-01273-7" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chandler et al., 2019</a>). The two waves differed from each other in terms of how quotas were set. In the first sample, the full sample was matched to the U.S. Census and the sample was equally split between Republicans, Democrats and Independents. In the second wave, rather than matching the entire sample to the U.S. Census, each political party was matched to the demographic quotas appropriate for that party. The results presented above are for the first wave of participants, although the overall findings were similar across both waves. Specifically, in Wave 2, 10.5% of Trump supporters said they were likely to be untruthful on phone surveys compared to 4.6% of Biden supporters.</p><h3><strong>Survey Design&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Prior to entering the survey, all respondents were screened for attentiveness and English language comprehension. Following the screening process a <em>responsive verification protocol</em> was used, consisting of multiple interactive interview steps. Step 1 – Respondents were first asked one of two randomly assigned questions: Q1 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked in an automated telephone poll (also called “Interactive Voice Response” or “IVR”), would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. Q2 – “Given today’s charged political environment, if you were asked by a telephone interviewer, would you give your true opinion about which presidential candidate you are likely to vote for?”. We also wanted to compare how comfortable respondents are in responding to telephone polls, compared to online and in-person polls. We therefore also asked the same question about phone interviews, online surveys, and in-person polls, presented next to each other in the same grid. The response options to all questions were: 1. “I would definitely express my true opinion”, 2. “I would probably express my true opinion”, 3. “I would probably not express my true opinion” and 4. “I would definitely not express my true opinion”.</p><p>Step 2 – For those who indicated that they would not provide their true opinion on either question from Step 1 (i.e. responded with options 3 or 4), a follow-up question was asked: “On a previous question, you indicated that you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Whenever someone sees my editor, this is always the first thing they ask
about.</p>

<p>Vim (and Emacs) have features that let you conceal text with other text.
The actual source text is not modified. If you put your cursor on the
concealed line, the conceal goes away.</p>

<p>This is best illustrated by example. Here’s what the Python code
normally looks like:</p>

<pre><code>identity = lambda x: x
</code></pre>

<p>But here’s what I see:</p>

<pre><code>identity = λ x: x
</code></pre>

<p>It’s really easy to abuse since no one has to view it but you, unlike
code formatting. I ended up creating an entire mini-language, consistent
across multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>The running examples throughout this blog post will be Python and Rust,
because I’ve used those recently. Haskell is another language that
benefits a lot from this.</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets
it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect
increases the mental power of the race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we start by unifying the building blocks of every language with
prettier Unicode versions.</p>

<pre><code>==          | ≝
!=          | ≠
&lt;=          | ≤
&gt;=          | ≥

and, &amp;&amp;     | ∧
or, ||      | ∨
not, !      | ¬

None        | ∅
true, false | ⊤, ⊥ (top and bottom from logic)

for         | ∀
in          | ∈
not in      | ∉

=           | ← (to remind me that equality is really assignment)
-&gt;          | → (that's an arrow replaced by a better arrow)

assert      | ‼
</code></pre>

<p>Types are concealed with their math symbols</p>

<pre><code>bool        | 𝔹
char        | ∁
string, str | 𝐒

unsigned    | ℕ
int         | ℤ
float       | ℝ
complex     | ℂ

vector      | V
tensor      | 𝕋
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice because it makes reading code uniform across languages.
Basic constructs like <code>for .. in ..</code> read like math.</p>

<h2 id="idiosyncratic">Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>Most of this category is for making ugly syntax bearable.</p>

<p>I read a lot of scientific code and Greek letters as variable names
abound.</p>

<p>So I concealed the entire Greek alphabet, lower and uppercase.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at <code>::</code> in C++ and Rust. Conceptually, it’s
like a dot operator for the purposes of reading code, so I conceal it
with <code>.</code>.</p>

<p>I also don’t like looking at semicolons, and my linter will tell me if I
missed them, so they get concealed with <code>𐤟</code> (which is apparently a
Phoenician word separator. It should look like a very faint dot, but may
not render correctly in the browser. You can see I’ve scoured a lot of
glyphs for this).</p>

<p>I hate the use of <code>self</code> in Python, so I concealed it with <code>♀</code>, the
female sign emoji. It looks like a little person (a little <em>self</em>), and
is a single character.</p>

<p>If I’m going to see a word a lot in a lot of contexts, it’s probably
going to end up concealed.</p>

<h3 id="grammar-of-control-flow">Grammar of control flow</h3>

<p>I have a system for conditionals and looping.</p>

<pre><code>loop              | ∞ (`loop` is just `while True`)
while             | ⥁
continue          | ↻

match, if         | ▸
elif              | ▹
else              | ▪

break             | ◁
return            | ◀


def, fn, function | ※ (Japanese typography reference marker)
class             | §
</code></pre>

<p>The infinity and ouroboros symbols for <code>loop</code> and <code>while</code> feel
intuitive.</p>

<p>The rest, not so much. I worked up this system late at night.</p>

<p><code>continue</code> is a loop because it doesn’t break out of the loop (that’s
why it loops clockwise since I always imagine looping going clockwise).
It’s a broken ouroboros because it cuts off the current iteration.</p>

<p>The conditionals always start with an <code>if</code>, which is filled in, and just
gets a pointer to indicate, “hey look at this condition”. Conditions
have to end with an <code>if</code> or an <code>else</code>, but not an <code>elif</code>, so <code>elif</code> gets
an empty pointer. <code>else</code> is indicated by the mathematical “end of proof”
symbol, since the <code>else</code> ends the conditional. In this way, a
conditional is only valid if it begins and ends with solid markers.</p>

<p><code>return</code> takes you out of a function’s scope, and I think of going in
scope as going rightwards, so <code>return</code> points left. Plus the right
pointer was taken by <code>if</code>. <code>break</code> is similar but may not take you out
of <em>all</em> scopes, just the innermost loop enclosing it.</p>

<p>I think the <code>function</code> conceal is pretty clear. The <code>class</code> conceal is
because I think of classes like I think of sections in an essay, so they
get a section marker.</p>

<h2 id="really-idiosyncratic">Really Idiosyncratic</h2>

<p>AKA mathy.</p>

<pre><code>range  | ι
unsafe | ☡

struct | ∏
enum   | ∐
</code></pre>

<p>The iota is because that’s the one bit of APL I know.</p>

<p><code>unsafe</code> comes from the “dangerous bend” symbol that Bourbaki used to
indicate a tricky section in their books. That concession to
user-friendliness ironically concealed a dangerous bend. Which was the
fact that Bourbaki books don’t care about anyone being able to read
them.</p>

<p><code>struct</code> and <code>enum</code> are product and sum (AKA coproduct) types, so they

<p>It lets me <em>feel</em> my code rather than read it. It makes seeing the
<em>shape</em> of code easier at first pass, and I can see the forest for the
trees somewhat better. But then I have to hunker down and edit it.</p>

<h2 id="important">Important</h2>

<pre><code>function! ToggleConcealLevel()
    if &amp;conceallevel == 0
        setlocal conceallevel=2
    else
        setlocal conceallevel=0
    endif
endfunction

nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;C-c&gt;&lt;C-y&gt; :call ToggleConcealLevel()&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That toggles the conceal. Now other people can read over your shoulder.
It’ll also spare you explanations of how you got the <code>for</code> to look like
it does in math.</p>

<p>In April 2012, three college juniors — Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla — waited anxiously on the campus of Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. For the previous six months, their lives had been consumed by the pursuit of a single, radical idea: frustrated that women, year after year, were barred from the annual Gamers’ Day convention, <a href="http://gamersday.com/en/about-us.php#:~:text=Gamers'%20Day%20is%20a%20gaming,numbers%20of%20visitors%20and%20exhibitors">the largest annual gaming convention in Saudi Arabia</a>, they had decided to launch the first-ever gamers’ convention for women in the kingdom. As the organizers hurried around counting consoles and hanging posters near stalls, they wondered whether anyone would show up.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia’s gaming scene has dramatically evolved, especially for women. In the early 2000s, the country had strict moral regulations on entertainment, and games were mostly sold in a gray market or through unofficial channels. Areej, a 23-year-old university graduate, picked up her interest in gaming from her father, who once frequented the informal neighborhood stores that sold pirated copies of popular games for 10 riyals ($2). “He played Japanese and English games, even though he didn’t even understand English back then,” she recalled. “He would keep dictionaries around while playing. That’s actually how he learned the language.” Areej hopes to become a “localizer,” a job that entails translating English-language games into Arabic. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have been possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After Sony’s 2007 release of the PlayStation 3 in the kingdom, the gaming industry began to take shape in Saudi Arabia. The first <a href="https://www.gamersday.com/en/">Gamers’ Day</a> took place in 2008, and it now draws upward of 60,000 male visitors over the course of four days. The convention presents video game companies with a lucrative opportunity to demo their latest equipment and products; devoted players, in turn, get to try out highly anticipated games that have not yet been released. In 2012, as the three girls were setting up Girls Con (or GCON as it would come to be known), the industry was estimated to have a global revenue stream of $70 billion.</p>



<p>In the months prior to GCON, Tasnim, the only one in the group with work experience, took the lead pitching sponsorship proposals to the all-male staffs at Nintendo and PlayStation Arabia. Without any real data on female gamers in the Middle East, and with barely any on girl gamers in North America, she had pitched on the assumption that the <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/male-and-female-gamers-how-their-similarities-and-differences-shape-the-games-market/">gender ratio for gamers in Saudi Arabia</a> was likely the same as in the United States: 47%. But there was no way to prove this. Until then, the world of female gaming in Saudi Arabia was a private one, usually set in the intimacy of people’s bedrooms.</p>



<p>“You could find girls who played video games, just for fun or on their mobile phone, but I had no idea how many girls were into hardcore gaming,” Felwa said. While mobile games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush were popular — the Kingdom boasts a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/xe/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/GMCS-whitepaper.pdf">90% cell phone penetration rate</a> — Felwa was curious to see how many girls had grown up like her playing Tomb Raider, Tekken, and League of Legends.</p>



<p>When the hall flooded with nearly 3,000 women, some as young as 13 and others in their 50s, it was a shock. “I definitely did not expect moms to come,” Felwa said. Back then, it was mandatory for women to wear the traditional black abaya, and often a headscarf, while in public. It was only when the women walked through the doors into the all-female space that their abayas slipped off to reveal an array of cosplay costumes.</p>



<p>Inside the hallway, girls who were expected to behave discreetly at all times rushed around trying to play as many PlayStation- and Nintendo-sponsored games as they could. On one side of the hall, first-time cosplayers shared a rare opportunity to express their fandom. On the other, 150 people stood in a rowdy line waiting their turn in a Call of Duty tournament.</p>

<p><strong>While the Middle</strong> <strong>East</strong> represents only a small portion of the international gaming industry, it is a rapidly expanding market. In 2017, the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council accounted for around $693 million of gaming revenue, most related to esports. By 2021, that number is expected to exceed <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/press-releases/2020/gcc-gaming-market.html">$821 million</a>, boosted in part by the pandemic-induced lockdown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saudi Arabia expects to be at the forefront<strong> </strong>of that expansion. In a country where roughly 50% of the population is under 30, gaming has become an emblem for a generation of young Saudis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, Prince Faisal bin Bandar, a young member of the royal family raised on Atari consoles, set out to make Saudi Arabia the Middle East’s hub for the $160 billion gaming industry. Under his leadership, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://safeis.sa/">Saudi Arabian Federation for Electronic and Intellectual Sports (SAFEIS)</a> aims for esports revenue to amount to 1% of the country’s GDP (approximately $22 billion) by 2030.</p>



<p>While Saudi Arabia was a late arrival to esports, its male players have already made their mark. Since 2017, Prince Faisal and the federation have been scouting, coaching, and sending professional esports players to competitions across the world. Mossad Al-Dossary, then 18, made headlines in 2018 after <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/news/msdossary-triumphs-fifa-eworld-cup-grand-final-london">winning first place</a> at the FIFA eWorld Cup in London, taking home a $250,000 cash prize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Female gamers, however, are still finding their way. Women in Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla’s generation grew up under the watch of religious police, in a time when public spaces were segregated by gender. While women still do not have the same rights as men, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman<strong> </strong>has relaxed male-guardianship rules and mandatory dress codes and legalized certain forms of entertainment for women. “I still struggle to convey what Saudi Arabia was like at that time to those that haven’t had that experience,” Tess said. There were no theaters, and sports facilities for girls were limited, “So, mostly, we had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p>



<p>Raghad, 23, currently works for a mining company, but she dreams of becoming a voice actor for video games. Although she’s never lived anywhere but Saudi Arabia, she has a distinctly squeaky American accent — a curious trait she picked up from a fifth-grade teacher who had lived in the U.S. and a torrent of YouTube videos. She is considering taking voice-acting classes online, assuming she can find any, because she’s not allowed to travel abroad alone to study until after she’s married. It’s still common to meet women who come to gaming as a result of these kinds of restrictions, as Felwa, Tasnim, and Najla did years ago. This is why going to GCON can be such a powerful experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In 2018, Felwa,</strong> Tasnim, and Najla handed GCON over to Ghada Al-Moqbel, who attended her first GCON in 2013 at the age of 18. Now she leads Saudi Arabia’s women’s gaming community. This occurred right after bin Salman took control and began dismantling the country’s gender segregation. For Ghada and the wider community of female gamers, these changes forced them to decide whether they wanted to stay on the fringes of the gaming community or take a more central role. In 2018, GCON organizers met regularly to discuss whether there was still value in creating an exclusively female space for gaming.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We had to stay inside and make do with what we had — and games were all that we had.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Ghada, the answer was yes. While attitudes toward female gamers have improved, parts of Saudi society remain uncomfortable with this burgeoning culture. When GCON first launched, participants were criticized for indulging in supposedly immoral behavior, and social media accounts of female gamers were routinely hacked. Likewise, after the first Comic Con in Jeddah, in 2017, a<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86_%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%84_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%87?src=hashtag_click"> hashtag</a> accusing participants of being Satan worshippers flooded social media along with pictures of women who had dressed up for cosplay. Thanks in part to the continuing fear of societal backlash, many Saudi women still advocate for all-female events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But like the kingdom, GCON is also evolving. “We’re not just entertainment anymore,” Ghada said. “It’s about empowering and enabling women to be serious in the gaming and esports industry.” In mid-August, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, the largest women-only university in the world, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1718151/saudi-arabia">announced</a> that it would be creating a degree program for animation.</p>



<p>Since Ghada took over, the organization has expanded, hosting regular skill-development workshops as well as the annual convention. While she has maintained GCON’s focus on female gamers, she has been open to collaborating with their male peers. In 2017, organizers from Gamer’s Day worked with GCON to arrange their first mixed-gender gaming event. While 2020 was supposed to be a big year for Ghada and GCON, Covid-19 disrupted their plans. Nonetheless, it’s unlikely that GCON — a force that arose in far more challenging terrain — will be going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>Most people are familiar with central banks’ ability to create money out of thin air. A central bank has access to physical printing presses which can produce physical banknotes, and it has the corresponding ability to create electronic money. However, central banks are not the only entities which create money. Money is also created by regular banks, such as retail banks and commercial banks, in the process of making loans.</p>
<p>Many people believe that regular banks’ ability to create money is similar to central banks’ ability to create money. It is not. This misconception has been perpetuated by a powerful cast of characters which includes <a href="https://www.hs.fi/tiede/art-2000002869261.html" target="_blank">mainstream news outlets</a> and even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070" target="_blank">some economists</a>.</p>
<p>This article will demystify money creation by illustrating the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bank deposit is merely an IOU.</li>
<li>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs.</li>
<li>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air.</li>
<li>When a customer redeems an IOU at a bank, the bank typically needs to hand over another form of money — the kind that it cannot create out of thin air.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bank deposits are merely IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 in cash. You decide to deposit it at your local bank. Now you no longer have $100 in cash. Instead, you have a <em>promise</em> from the bank that you can withdraw $100 in cash at any time. The bank has $100 in cash and you have a promise. Let’s imagine this promise as a physical document acknowledging debt, an IOU (”I owe you”). The bank owes you $100 and promises that you can exchange this IOU to $100 cash at any time.</p>

<p>Is this IOU ”money”? We’ll get to that later, but the short answer is yes, that IOU is money. There are different types of money, and checking account deposits are usually considered to be a type of money.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate this bank deposit as an exchange:</p>

<p>Assets are things the bank <em>owns</em>, liabilities are things the bank <em>owes</em>. In this simplified example, the only asset that the bank has is the $100 in cash that you deposited — now considered to be the <em>bank’s</em> asset — and the only liability is the $100 debt that the bank owes to you. These accounting entries were created at the same time: when the bank incremented your checking account by $100 (the deposit liability in bank’s accounting), there was a corresponding $100 cash deposit (the cash asset in bank’s accounting).</p>
<p><strong>A bank loan is merely an exchange of 2 IOUs</strong></p>
<p>Let’s continue with the example where you deposited $100 to a bank. Suppose I will go into that bank and ask for a $10 loan. Now that the bank owns $100, it can easily afford to loan me $10. I promise to pay back $11 at a later point in time, so the bank is eager to offer me a loan and make that dollar.</p>
<p>The bank deposits this $10 loan to my checking account. Remember, checking account deposits are IOUs, so the bank just gave me a $10 IOU. I promised to pay back $11, so I also created an IOU. In other words, this loan is an exchange of 2 IOUs: the bank promises to give me $10 in cash whenever I want, and I promise to give the bank $11 at a later point in time. Let’s imagine these IOUs as physical documents:</p>

<p>The bank still has that $100 cash in assets, and it still has that $100 liability to John. But now the bank also has a $10 liability to me: I could withdraw my $10 from the bank in cash at any time. Corresponding to this liability, the bank has recorded a new asset: my promise to pay back $11 later.</p>
<p>Notice how the bank now has $110 of deposits, but only $100 of cash in the vault. Welcome to fractional reserve banking! If I decided to withdraw my $10 from the bank today, and you decided to withdraw your $100 from the bank tomorrow, the bank would say ”oops, we no longer have your money”. In practice this rarely happens due to a myriad of reasons (banks can trade assets between each other when they have too little/too much cash, banks have internal risk controls which limit lending and other risky endeavours, lawmakers impose restrictions which are monitored by regulators, the existence of deposit insurance reduces likelihood of bank runs, etc.).</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get to the interesting bit. Before taking out the loan there was $100 on checking account balances and afterwards there was $110 on checking account balances. Clearly, money was created in the process of taking out the loan. Where did this money come from? Was it created out of thin air? The short answer is yes, kind of, but let’s step back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>What is money, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the cash deposit example. You deposit $100 into a bank and the bank records it as an asset. The bank records a corresponding liability: a $100 deposit to your checking account. Did the bank create money in this scenario?</p>
<p>Before the deposit there was $100 of cash money, but after the deposit there was $100 of cash money + $100 of electronic money = $200 worth of money in total. But of course we don’t want to ”double count” your money just because you deposited it in a bank, right? That’s why economists developed this convention that cash money in a bank’s vault is considered to be ”out of circulation”, and thus, is not typically counted when we count how much money exists.</p>

<p>The Eurozone M1 definition for money is <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/money_credit_banking/monetary_aggregates/html/hist_content.en.html" target="_blank">basically</a> equal to this notion of ”currency in circulation”. The concept of money is ambiguous, so there are many different definitions, varying by both economic area and by use case. Nevertheless, checking account balances are included in most commonly used definitions (though not in all, for instance the UK M0 definition for money <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m0-data" target="_blank">does not</a> include checking account balances).</p>
<p>In abstract terms we might think that the $100 cash you deposited into a bank was transformed into a $100 checking account balance. Except it wasn’t. That $100 of cash money still exists. It was not transformed into anything. The bank took $100 of cash and put it in a vault. Then the bank created an IOU out of thin air and gave it to you. (We can say that the IOU was created out of thin air, because the corresponding $100 cash in the vault is not earmarked to this IOU — the bank may run out of cash before you try to redeem that IOU.) Then economists decided that the IOU counts as money, and the cash in the vault does not count as money. Thus, the act of depositing cash in a bank does not result in (net) creation of money. $100 of electronic money is added to circulation while $100 of cash money is removed from circulation, for a net difference of $0.</p>
<p>When you deposit cash in a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. Similarly, when you take a loan out of a bank, the bank creates an IOU out of thin air. However, due to accounting conventions, the latter action results in net money creation, while the former action does not. (Although these conventions are weird, they make sense: currency in circulation is a good measure with real implications for economic activity, and currency in circulation is genuinely increased when banks loan money.)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone can create IOUs out of thin air</strong></p>
<p>If there’s only one thing you take away from this article, let it be this. IOUs are promises. Anyone can make promises out of thin air. For example, I could be handing out IOUs like this, furbished with my signature for authenticity:</p>

</div>
<p>You might think these would be worthless, but that’s not exactly the case. People who know me would think ”Atte is good for $10”. These would not be worth exactly $10, because you would still rather take $10 in cash than a coupon that’s exchangeable for $10 in cash. And it’s unlikely that these IOUs would be used to facilitate real economic activity, so these IOUs should not be considered ”money”. Although there are clear differences in how these IOUs <em>would be used</em>, compared to the IOUs created by banks, is there any <em>fundamental</em> difference between the IOUs themselves?</p>
<p>Let’s take another example and get one step closer to creating money. This one is real, not hypothetical, example of IOUs created by a non-bank corporation.</p>
<p>We have to go all the way back to 2011. Poker is booming and Full Tilt Poker is one of 2 giants dominating the scene (the other being PokerStars). The way that poker sites work is you deposit money (like you would in a bank) and then as you play poker and you win and lose money from other players, the poker site keeps track of how much money everyone has (like a bank would keep track of transfers between customers of the same bank).</p>
<p>In other words, a poker site issues IOUs to players. These IOUs are supposedly redeemable at any time (like the IOUs created by a bank). The IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were largely treated as money by players of the site, to the point where they were used to facilitate real economic activity. For example, it was typical for players to settle small debts (like $10 for a movie ticket) by sending a player-to-player transfer on Full Tilt Poker instead of sending a bank transfer (because transfers on poker sites were typically faster and easier to make than bank transfers).</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the IOUs created by Full Tilt Poker were money. They simply were not counted as money due to accounting conventions. Now, some of you might be thinking <em>”Wait a minute… Doesn’t the poker site have all player funds in the bank? If all player funds have corresponding bank deposits, then those bank deposits would already be counted as money, and we wouldn’t want to double count that money.”</em> Yeah, I also thought that Full Tilt Poker had player funds in the bank (can you guess where this is going?).</p>
<p>On April 15, 2011, known in the poker world as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg" target="_blank">Black Friday</a>, the FBI raided offices of Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars as part of a larger crackdown on online gambling. This law enforcement action triggered an instant bank run by players: everyone …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>It’s common to talk about the way we build software in terms of the individual tools we compose together, like command-line utilities and deployment pipelines and containers and services, and most obviously, <em>programming languages</em>. Programming languages seem to get the highest level of scrutiny out of everything that comprises the way we write software. And in the last decade, I think we’ve seen a healthy rejuvenation of innovation in programming languages, driven by languages like Rust, Go, OCaml, Zig, and Swift that bring new ideas to the industrial programming world in practical packages.</p>
<p>But while programming languages are academically interesting, I think <strong>we more desperately need innovation in programming <em>environments</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The programming <em>environment</em> isn’t a single component of our workflow, but the total sum enabled by the tools working together harmoniously. The environment contains the programming language, but also includes the debugging experience, dependency management, how we communicate with other developers (both within source code and without), how we trace and observe code in production, and everything else in the process of designing APIs to recovering from failure.</p>
<p>The story of programming language evolution is also a story of rising ideas in what capabilities good programming <em>environments</em> should grant developers. Many languages came to popularity not necessarily based on their merits as great languages, but because they were paired with some new and powerful capability to understand software and write better implementations of it.</p>
<p>C brought practical portability to (what was at the time) high level programs. C literally elevated the programming environment out of processor-specific assembly code into a common vernacular. The legacy is so strong that most languages we use in production today are either direct descendants of C, or inherit much of their syntax, like curly brace-delineated blocks and structures, semicolon statement-terminators, and parenthesized function calls.</p>
<p>JavaScript is popular outside of the browser almost entirely on the merit of its ecosystem, its tooling, and the trivial debugging experience enabled by the repl. JavaScript’s programming environment is entirely interactive, visual, and real-time, without the need for clunky debugging apparatuses. The impact of that interactivity is obvious in the fact that many of my developer friends started programming on the Web, explicitly because it was the easiest way to write programs that produced output we could see and share.</p>
<p>One of Go’s claims to fame and primary design goals is compilation speed. Compared to its predecessor C++, Go compiles fast. And when you make something fast, people start to use it differently.</p>
<p>Erlang, with its <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">advanced, concurrent, message-passing runtime</a>, offers a better way to build high availability, highly reliable systems. It was born in the telecom industry, but has found home in many other critical services industries.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully crafted programming environments are the hidden treasures of the software industry. When we choose a language because of the “tooling” or because of the “IDE experience” or because of “the workflow,” what we are really doing is making a judgement about the programming <em>environment</em> we want to live in and grow around our work.</p>
<p>Between investments being made into new languages and the community’s willingness to experiment, there’s a lot of creative energy being poured into inventing better languages. I think it would serve us well if we invested just as deeply into rethinking the context in which we write those programs. We should be asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>While professional photo editors and video games can run in the browser, why are we still using a repl that prints lines in the terminal?</li>
<li>Does the compile-time / run-time distinction make sense to have? Can we give better control to developers about when their code is executed during the software development and deployment process?</li>
<li>What does an operating system kernel designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>What does a memory model or memory allocator designed for debugging experience look like?</li>
<li>Are the tools we have today good enough foundations for massive open-source communities like NPM? How can we improve the programming environment and our tools to make the most of package repositories with hundreds of millions of libraries and billions of lines of code?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some people trying to create better programming environments. <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> brings general purpose development to the browser. Experiments like <a href="http://lighttable.com/">Light Table</a> more closely integrate source code with its output. Jupyter notebooks are a unique way of writing and sharing code that focus on the process of iteration.</p>
<p>But these are also workflows and tools built around languages that were never designed for such interactive experiences. I think if we build a culture of thinking about programming environments as a place ripe for creative innovation, we’ll see a new class of software development tools emerge that make the most of today’s machines and networks and allow us to write new kinds of software we couldn’t before.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>May 03, 2020</p></header><p>Modern applications don’t crash; they hang. One of the main reasons for it is the assumption that the network is reliable. It isn’t. </p><p>When you make a network call without setting a timeout, you are telling your code that you are 100% confident that the call is going to succeed. Would you really take that bet?</p><p>If you are a making synchronous network call that never returns, then to very least your thread hogs forever. Whoops. Asynchronous network calls that don’t return are not free either. Sure, you are not hogging threads, but you are leaking sockets. Any HTTP client library worth its salt uses socket pools to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">avoid recreating connections</a>. And those pools have a limited capacity. Like any other resource leak, it’s only a matter of time until there are no sockets left. When that happens, your application is going to get stuck waiting for a connection to free up.</p><p>If the network is not reliable, why do we keep creating APIs that have infinity as the default timeout? Some APIs don’t even have a way to set a timeout in the first place! A good API should be easy to use the right way and hard to use the wrong way. When the default timeout is infinity, it’s all too easy for a client to shoot itself in the foot. </p><p>If you remember one thing from this post, then let it be this: <strong>never use “infinity” as a default timeout</strong>.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some concrete examples.</p><p>Javascript’s XMLHttpRequest is THE web API to retrieve data from a server asynchronously. Its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/timeout">default timeout is zero</a>, which means there is no timeout!</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> xhr <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>XMLHttpRequest</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
xhr<span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'/api'</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span><span>;</span>

xhr<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Client-side timeouts are as crucial as server-side ones. There is a <a href="https://hpbn.co/primer-on-browser-networking/#connection-management-and-optimization">maximum number of sockets your browser</a> can open for a particular host. If you make network requests that never returns, you are going to exhaust the socket pool. When the pool is exhausted, you are no longer able to connect to the host. </p><p>The fetch web API is a modern replacement for the XMLHttpRequest API, which uses Promises. When the API was initially introduced, there was <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/951">no way to set a timeout at all</a>! Browsers have recently added experimental support for the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">Abort API</a> to support timeouts, though.</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> controller <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AbortController</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

((tl;dr See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg">my video presentation/demonstration</a> of this essay))
</p>

<p>
Maintaining servers falls into two phases:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Bang head until server works</li>
<li>Capture effort into some automation tool like Puppet or Chef.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Recently, I’ve been playing around with making the first phase closer
to the second.  For lack of a better word, I’m calling it <i>literate
devops</i>.
</p>

<p>
I’ve talked about using <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">org-mode’s <i>literate programming</i> model</a> to
investigate new ideas and crystallize thoughts, and this approach
appears to work well for me since I lack those esoteric sysadmin
skills.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbcbce75">
<h2 id="orgbcbce75">Tell us a Story</h2>
<div id="text-orgbcbce75">
<p>
Once upon a time, I was tasked with patching an RPM, which is not in
my comfort zone, so my initial plan of attack was:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Vagrant to create a disposable CentOS system</li>
<li>SSH into this virtual machine to download needed tools</li>
<li>Run various unknown commands</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat this step until successful</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, once I figure out the solution, I need to document it for
others on my team, and maybe create a <i>repeatedable</i> script.
</p>

<p>
First step is well documented elsewhere, but today I learned (TIL)
you can <code>ssh</code> directly to your Vagrant-based virtual machine with
this little magic (<b>Note:</b> <i>client</i> is the name of my virtual
machine I specified in the <code>Vagrantfile</code>):
</p>

<div>
<pre>vagrant ssh-config --host clientvm &gt;&gt; $<span>HOME</span>/.ssh/config
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This command appends some lovely host-connection magic so you can
issue: <code>ssh clientvm</code>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8dff3db">
<h2 id="org8dff3db">Literate Devops</h2>
<div id="text-org8dff3db">
<p>
Instead of opening up a terminal to my virtual machine, I pop into
Emacs and load this sprint’s <i>note file</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, create a new header,
and enter the shell and ruby commands in this text file.
</p>

<p>
What good is this? Unlike a traditional terminal, this allows me to
<i>log</i>, <i>document</i> and <i>execute</i> each command.
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is a screen-shot of a section of my Emacs buffer:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.png" alt="literate-devops.png">

</figure>

<p>
As an old bear with very little brains, my prose can explain the
background and purpose of each command.  Clicking the hyperlink
refreshes my memory of previous discoveries. A keychord <i>executes</i>
the code block…
</p>

<p>
Yes. I execute the commands from within Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Hitting <code>C-c C-c</code> (Control-C twice) runs the code (based on the
language).  This example runs in the shell. The results are placed
back into the file, which can be used by other code blocks (and <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/results.html#results">many
other options</a>).
</p>

<p>
For instance, here is the first half of a section for downloading
the GPG Keys from a repository (the URL is placed in a <i>property</i>
that is shared among all code blocks in his section):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-14.png" alt="literate-devops-14.png">

</figure>

<p>
The Shell script block (in the center of the screen-shot) uses
<code>wget</code> to download the HTML index file and parse and extract the key
file URLs.  We’ll have a Ruby script do that parsing, and since the
script may be a bit hairy, we’ll define it in another code block.
</p>

<p>
One technique from <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/LP/introduction.html">literate programming</a> is the idea that one code
block can be inserted into another block (the reference is a name
within double angle brackets, <code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>). Donald Knuth called this
feature WEB. Since it can accidentally conflict with some languages
(like Ruby), I have it off by default, but turn it on for this block
with the <code>noweb</code> parameter.
</p>

<p>
Here is the Ruby script. Having it in a separate Ruby-specific code
block allows me to turn on all the Ruby magic that Emacs can muster.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-15.png" alt="literate-devops-15.png">

</figure>

<p>
The last step is to take the URLs produced by the first script and
feed them to another Shell script that will call <code>wget</code> to download
each:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-16.png" alt="literate-devops-16.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>key-list</code> was the name of our original code block, as well as
the name of its results. We assign that list of results to a
variable, <code>LIST</code> that the shell script would access as <code>$LIST</code>.
</p>

<p>
This example demonstrated how literate programming can weave code
and data through different languages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5d7bdd1">
<h2 id="org5d7bdd1">What about the Virtual Machine?</h2>
<p>
Normally, specifying <code>sh</code> as the code block’s <i>language</i>, tells
Emacs to run the code in my local system’s shell, but in this case,
I want it ran on my virtual machine (or on my development server in
my lab). I’ll describe two options for doing this, using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/TrampMode">Tramp</a> and
Babel Sessions.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org2251b72">
<h3 id="org2251b72">Tramp to the Rescue</h3>
<div id="text-org2251b72">
<p>
Tramp is an Emacs feature that allows one to edit a file on a
remote machine using <code>ssh</code> and other protocols. For instance,
running the <code>find-file</code> function (bound to <code>C-x C-f</code>) lets you type
something like:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:howard.abrams@goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
If you put the following in your <code>.emacs</code> initialization file:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>setq</span> tramp-default-method <span>"ssh"</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And update your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to know what user account goes
with the host name, the file reference above can be shorten to:
</p>

<pre>/goblin.howardism.org:web/files/robot.txt
</pre>

<p>
Emacs looks for the <code>:</code> character to determine if Tramp should be
invoked.  Tramp uses SSH keys if available, or will prompt you for
a password if needed.
</p>


<p>
Each org-mode code block can specify a <code>:dir</code> option that specifies
where the code snippet should run, for instance, the following
blocks are equivalent:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-9.png" alt="literate-devops-9.png">

</figure>

<p>
The <code>:dir</code> option allows full Tramp functionality, allowing me to
run a block on a different machine. Remember how I added my
<code>client</code> Vagrant virtual machine to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file?
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-10.png" alt="literate-devops-10.png">

</figure>

<p>
<i>But I need access to my machine behind a firewall!?</i>
</p>

<p>
My job deals with virtual machines running in a highly protected
data center, where I need to first log into jump boxes and bastion
machines. Tramp handles these sorts of hops. For instance:
</p>

<pre>/ssh:10.98.18.229|ssh:10.0.1.122|sudo:/etc/network/interfaces
</pre>

<p>
Uses my account name to log into the bastion machine, and
then uses my account name to <code>ssh</code> into a virtual machine running
in a private cloud. And then uses the <code>sudo</code> command to let me edit
a file owned by <code>root</code>.
</p>

<p>
Tramp pipe references works with the <code>:dir</code> option for <code>org-mode</code>
source blocks:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-11.png" alt="literate-devops-11.png">

</figure>

<p>
Few tricks to keep in mind:
</p>

<ul>
<li>All but the last hop uses a pipe character, |, instead of the
colon character, :</li>
<li>If you use the pipe character, you need to specify all
protocols, like <code>ssh</code>, even if it is the default.</li>
<li>If your local machine’s operating system is different than the
machine you are connecting to, you need to fix a bug in
<code>org-mode</code>, which I can show you how to fix<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0d027af">
<h3 id="org0d027af">Using org-mode Sessions</h3>
<div id="text-org0d027af">
<p>
Another approach is to create a <i>session</i> that connects different
code blocks together. Each screen shot below, each code block below
has the same <code>session</code> value, <code>client</code> (which is conveniently the
same my virtual machine’s hostname, <code>client</code>):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-2b.png" alt="literate-devops-2b.png">

</figure>

<p>
If I execute the first block, a <i>shell</i> is started in the
background, and it ssh’s into the machine. Note, to get this
working, you need to enable <i>password-less access</i> by placing your
SSH’s public key into the remote system’s <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
file, or using the <code>ssh</code> Emacs package.<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
From this point on, each code block I execute with the <code>client</code>
session value, uses this connection, and the code is executed on the
remote machine (a virtual machine in this case, but that doesn’t
matter).
</p>

<p>
Either of these approaches works well, but the second approach,
allows me to set variables to create a particular state that other
blocks may expect.  However, this requires execution of each block in
order.
</p>

<p>
I have a third, more interactive, approach<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> using <code>screen</code>, but
it doesn’t allow passing variables to the code, and as you’ll see
below, this is pretty important to me.
</p>


<p>
Regardless, I continue learning how to accomplish my goal, all the
while documenting and <i>validating</i> my steps. The end result can be
exported to web or wiki page.

<div id="outline-container-org39ccdca">
<h2 id="org39ccdca">What about Verbose Commands?</h2>
<div id="text-org39ccdca">
<p>
Yes, executing some commands can be quite time-consuming and
verbose, but often I need to search the results, and having the
results placed in an Emacs buffer allows better searching.
</p>

<p>
Often I use a collapsible “drawer” (which is just a way to identify
the beginning and end of the output):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-3.png" alt="literate-devops-3.png">

</figure>

<p>
Place the cursor on this drawer and hit the <code>Tab</code> key to hide or
show the output:
</p>


<figure>

<div id="outline-container-org3721d6c">
<h2 id="org3721d6c">Can you Use the Output?</h2>
<div id="text-org3721d6c">
<p>
The results of some commands are often needed for the next command,
and I’m sure you just love using your mouse to copy and paste part
of the output, but I have a better way.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I needed a list of an RPM’s dependencies:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-5.png" alt="literate-devops-5.png">

</figure>

<p>
Notice I <i>named</i> this source code block. Also notice how Emacs
automatically broke the results up into a table. By default, the
output from shell commands are split along newlines and
spaces.
</p>

<p>
I can feed the results of these execution to another code block.
The following source block creates a variable named <code>DEPENDS</code> that
uses rows 2 through 10 of the first column as an array.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-6.png" alt="literate-devops-6.png">

</figure>

<p>
I then download the RPMs I want without any mouse interaction.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdfa5caa">
<h2 id="orgdfa5caa">Setting Variables and Values</h2>
<div id="text-orgdfa5caa">
<p>
A key aspect of reusing devops programs (like a Chef
cookbooks) is the separation of the <i>code</i> from the <i>values</i> the code
uses…a key aspect of <i>any</i> program you reuse.
</p>

<p>
In my world, I create a new <code>org-mode</code> file for each sprint, and
each task or problem gets its own header and section. Each section
can have a <i>drawer</i> of properties, including variables shared among
all code blocks in that section.
</p>

<p>
To create a <i>section variable</i>, simply hit: <code>C-c C-x p</code>, and set the
<code>Property</code> to <code>var</code> and the value to a <i>variable=value</i>, as in:
</p>



<p>
This drawer can contain any code block values you wish, like
<code>session</code> or <code>results</code>. These values can then be overridden as
settings on the code block, as you see in this screen-shot:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops-8.png" alt="literate-devops-8.png">

</figure>

<p>
Setting variables and settings (especially the <code>session</code> setting),
ties the code blocks together.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org874102b">
<h2 id="org874102b">Communicating with Others</h2>
<div id="text-org874102b">
<p>
While investigations in operations and administrations (as I’ve
described) are useful to oneself when understanding the problem
domain, I need to communicate the results with my team mates.
Since my <a href="https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files/blob/master/emacs-mail.org#sending-email">Emacs configuration</a> allows me to send mail messages, I kick
off the function, <code>org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize</code>, which exports the
<code>org-mode</code> file to an HTML mail message (This function is part of
the latest <code>org-plus-contrib</code> package).
</p>

<p>
However, some times the exported results are not quite perfect.

For instance, some blocks may result in some JSON data, and since</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>This is the first part of a blog series where I examine programming concepts from a scientific perspective. In this part I dig up every study relating to function length I could find, fill in some gaps with original research, and examine what we can learn.</p>



<p>Highlights:</p>



<ul id="block-f6ddbfdc-f37f-48df-8d67-6990d4b79de3"><li>We find that in older studies (pre-2000) short functions correlate with higher defect density</li><li>There seem to be no post-2000 studies exclusively focusing on function length, but through original research we find that modern code bases exhibit similar behavior</li><li>We also find that in empirical experiments short functions make code slower to debug, with some weaker evidence suggesting they also make it slower for adding new features but faster to modify</li></ul>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>In programming lore it’s hard to find sources glorifying long functions. This is codified, for example, in the widely quoted book ‘Clean Code’ which states:</p>



<blockquote><p>The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long</p></blockquote>



<p>Favoring short functions isn’t by any means a new practise – a 1986 study “An Empirical Study of Software Design Practices” states “keeping modules small” as a good design practise. They also quote a book from 1974, stating “many programming standards limit module size to one page (or 50-60 source lines of code)”.</p>



<p><strong>What is a small function?</strong></p>



<p>What was meant by shorts functions in the 80s is different from small functions of today. In a study from 1991 ([1]) the line between small and large functions is drawn at 142 lines, staggeringly long by modern standards. In the same vein, a study from 1984 groups functions into buckets by increments of 50 lines ([2]).</p>



<p>However, nowadays the vast majority of functions are under 50 lines. A quick analysis of Eclipse, a popular open source IDE, reveals it averages about 8.6 lines per method in its source code. Above mentioned book “Clean Code”, published in 2008, states that functions should rarely be more than 20 lines, and the author has stated in other contexts he often prefers to use single-line functions, and that about half of the functions written by the author in Ruby are single-liners.</p>



<p>This shift in function sizes is perhaps partially due to changes in programming languages. In the 80s a Fortran “module” was commonly considered a function and some variables&nbsp; (see eg. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_modules.htm</a>) and function was the basic building block of software, whereas nowadays most Java or C++ programmers would define “module” as a class consisting of multiple functions.</p>



<p>Many studies focus on analyzing module sizes without specifying what a module is, so I’ve only included studies which specifically state they analyze functions. This, combined with the change in what we consider a basic building block of software, combined with the historical shift in function sizes, makes it hard to properly analyze and aggregate the studies, but we can certainly try.</p>



<p><strong>Function length and defect density – pre-2000</strong></p>



<p>The first studies concerning the length of functions I could find were from the early 80s. Nowadays most studies examine the code on a class and package level, whereas in the 80s object oriented programming was still quite rare and functions were the main building blocks of software, so it made a lot of sense to examine functions and their error proneness.</p>



<p>The early research on function length and defect density found that very small functions tended to have higher defect densities. This has been cited in “Code Complete”, where Steve McConnell says: “The routine should be allowed to grow organically up to 100-200 lines, decades of evidence say that routines of such length no more error prone then shorter routines.” Further, he gives a reference to a study that says routines 65 lines or longer are cheaper to develop. (see appendix for a more extensive take on the studies used in Code Complete)</p>



<p>To dive further, a study from 1984 ([2]) grouped function to buckets with increments of 50 lines and measured the error density for each bucket. They found that smaller functions contained, on average, more defects per line:</p>

<p>A follow-up study ([3]) examined five Fortran projects, and states that “no significant relationship was found between module size and fault rate“ even though, in the same paragraph, the authors also state that “nevertheless, [small modules] exhibited the highest average fault rate because a small module with even a single fault will show a very high fault rate“. It’s not clear why the authors state that module size and fault rate has no significant relationship and then state that average fault rate is highest for small modules. Another conclusion from [3] is that larger functions are cheaper to develop.</p>



<p>A third empirical study ([1]) analyzed 450 routines and found that “small” routines (those with fewer than 143 source statements, including comments) had 23 percent more errors per line of code than larger routines but were 2.4 times less expensive to fix than larger routines. This is interesting since it contrasts with some other experimental results we’ll see later.</p>



<p>So far it appears short functions are correlated with higher defect density, but due to the large sizes of the examined functions you’d be forgiven for doubting the relevance of these studies to modern software engineering.</p>



<p><strong>Modern defect prediction literature</strong></p>



<p>Modern defect prediction approaches are characterized by large data sets and machine learning methods applied on them. They mainly concentrate on correlating features such as “average method length” and “lines of code” with defects in an attempt to create defect prediction models.</p>



<p>Several such studies have found a correlation between size of methods and defects. For example [4] found that the size of the longest method in a class correlates positively with post-relase defects. Does this mean we should refactor our long methods into short ones to avoid defects?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no. In those same studies, the number of methods also correlates with defects:</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=640%2C61&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="61" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C98&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C29&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C73&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1536%2C146&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=2048%2C195&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?resize=1568%2C149&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-22-at-4.01.53-PM.png?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The number of functions in a class also correlates with defects. [4]</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To put it plainly, if we have a long function and split it into smaller ones, we’re not removing a source of defects, but we would simply be switching from one to another.</p>



<p>The same effect can be seen in other defect prediction studies. For example in [5] we see that both “Weighted Methods per Class” and “Average Method Complexity” correlate with defects, where former is defined as “number of methods in the class” and latter as “the average method size for each class“.</p>



<p>In both studies both metrics have a statistically significant correlation with defects, and this appears to be the trend across many other studies in defect prediction literature.</p>



<p>The literature doesn’t provide a straightforward way to measure which feature (length or number of methods) is more significant when predicting defects. It’s quite possible that, for example, measures such as “average method complexity” and “number of methods in a class” simply act as 2nd order estimators for number of lines, in which case we’d simply be comparing which measure correlates better with the underlying metric.</p>



<p>In addition, we’re interested in examining the length of the functions on a more granular level. Finding out that the number of methods and the length of methods both correlate with defects doesn’t give us anything tangible, and doing this sort of class or module level correlation analysis doesn’t get us very far.</p>



<p>However, the datasets used in many of these studies are open and we can download them to try to examine the relationship between functions length and defects ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>Data set analysis</strong></p>



<p>Time to scare the wikipedia editors among you and do some original research. All the code and data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/">https://github.com/softwarebyscience/function-length/</a>.</p>



<p>I took two datasets which contained the features we are interested in, such as the number of methods and lines of code per class. The first dataset I worked with is simply called “Eclipse Bug Database” and it contained data from three major Eclipse releases ([7]).</p>



<p>In addition, I used the “Bug Prediction Dataset” from <a href="http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php">http://bug.inf.usi.ch/download.php</a> as it seemed larger than the Eclipse Bug Database. The data is collected between 2005 and 2009 from 5 different Java projects – for a more detailed explanation see [6].</p>



<p>The results from the first dataset are quite straightforward:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=511%2C375&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="511" height="375" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=1024%2C752&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?resize=768%2C564&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.13.53-PM.png?w=1174&amp;ssl=1 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Here smaller methods clearly have a higher defect density, with the minimum defect density roughly found in classes where the methods average around 10-15 lines. What’s perhaps hard to see from the chart is that defect density starts very slightly increasing towards the right.</p>



<p>The results from the second dataset are a bit more interesting (moving average in red):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=502%2C367&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="502" height="367" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=1024%2C750&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?resize=768%2C563&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/softwarebyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-9.15.45-PM.png?w=1168&amp;ssl=1 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, the distribution is quite different compared to the first dataset, even though I would’ve expected the distributions to look very similar. I have no good theories as to why this might be the case (apart from a bug in my code, although I did check it several times).</p>



<p>There are a few other interesting details here. The average error density in the second dataset is higher, and this is likely because we consider all bugs over the ~4 year period, whereas the first dataset only considers the last 6 months and specific type of bugs (see [6] and [7] for details). In addition there are some zero-length functions. These are likely methods of abstract classes, meant to be overwritten. When analyzing post-release defects we see a roughly similar picture, if noisier (graph can be found in …</p></div></div>

August 29, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/lebanon-schools-whatsapp-group/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/lebanon-schools-whatsapp-group/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>When 27-year-old Lebanese teacher Sara Mazbouh heard news of the Covid-19 stay-at-home order, her mind went straight to her students. Mazbouh, who has been teaching for nine years at a school in the suburbs of Beirut, wondered how they would cope. After the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-protests/protesters-block-roads-in-beirut-other-parts-of-lebanon-idUSKBN1XE0H7">nationwide protests</a> and shutdowns across Lebanon in October of last year, the day-to-day lives of her students would again be paralyzed by circumstances out of their control.</p>



<p>In the early weeks of the shutdown, Mazbouh and her colleagues photocopied their lessons, leaving them for parents to pick up at school. Then, <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse">like countless others around the world</a>, Mazbouh’s campus announced it would be closing for the rest of the year. Most of her students are firmly middle-class; she knew many parents wouldn’t be able to afford online learning — steady internet and a computer at home <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-telecommunication-in-government-hands/a-48634796#:~:text=But%20this%20progress%20does%20not,that%20is%20on%20the%20rise.">aren’t a given</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exasperated, Mazbouh messaged her fellow teachers on WhatsApp. A distance-learning solution, they soon realized, was right in front of them.</p>



<p>In Lebanon, where schools have been closed for over five months, WhatsApp has become an informal distance-learning app for students and teachers. The app allows educators to share their lessons using voice notes, videos, and photos in group chats that mimic a classroom structure.&nbsp;</p>

</p><figcaption>Six-year-old Omar Jamal sings a springtime nursery rhyme for Lebanese Mother’s Day in his backyard.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lebanon’s ongoing financial crisis has made it harder and harder for families to afford their phone bills. In the wake of the massive explosion that rocked the country’s capital in early August, more than 300,000 Beirutis, up to <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">one-third of them school-age children</a>, have been displaced from their homes. In spite of the odds, teachers and parents are embracing creative ways to keep their “WhatsApp schools” in session.</p>



<p>For Mazbouh and her fellow teachers, shifting classes to WhatsApp was a matter of necessity. “The school administration didn’t even ask us to pursue WhatsApp teaching as a solution,” she says. “But the kids shouldn’t have to waste their year.” The teachers at Mazbouh’s school had such success with their ad hoc WhatsApp classroom that the administrators organized similar group chats for their elementary school counterparts.</p>



<p>As teachers across the country bring their classrooms to WhatsApp, they have realized there are new students in their classrooms: parents. For younger students, the adults play videos, record their kids completing assignments, and send the footage to teachers, who monitor their progress. Kindergarten teacher Noura Chehayeb shares snippets of her students’ reading progress on Facebook along with encouraging messages for their parents, whom she tags in different posts. The clips offer glimpses into each household’s unique effort to maintain normalcy during the pandemic. In one, a mom films her child singing a nursery song in their backyard. In another, a girl practices her French spelling, while her father talks at a TV playing the nightly news in the background.</p>



<p>Even though it was never intended to be an educational tool, there are unique benefits to WhatsApp distance learning. Some of the higher-end platforms used for distance learning require technical skills and hardware, such as laptops, that not all families possess. WhatsApp requires only a smartphone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/451211974?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="234" height="426" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>Five-year-old Nourhane learns ocean vocabulary. She says she has fun getting filmed and likes to share her homework with her friends.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The app’s “read receipts” function as an unofficial monitoring tool for teachers tracking their students’ participation. Once a student opens a group chat, all texts and photos appear as “seen” from the teacher’s perspective. Antoine Gebian, a 41-year-old private-school teacher, realized WhatsApp treated audio messages a little differently: his students must open each clip to indicate a “played” receipt; he could check if they hadn’t listened to his voice notes. Gebian used the function as a sort of attendance tally for his WhatsApp classroom. While Lebanon’s school curricula are offered in French and English, many parents speak only Arabic fluently. WhatsApp’s voice notes allow Lebanese teachers to switch between the three with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But distance learning, even when held exclusively on WhatsApp, may be out of reach for Lebanon’s students this fall.</p>



<p>The effects of this month’s blast are far-reaching: the nearly 2,700-ton explosion obliterated Beirut’s port, Lebanon’s biggest and its main source for imports that sustain the country. The economic impact will go beyond the city itself. “Many parents are saying they can’t enroll their kids for economic and Covid reasons,” says Mazbouh, who was laid off from her job of nearly a decade in July. “The percentage of parents who are actually enrolling their kids is very low, and if they are, they’re not paying their fees.” Mazbouh’s school closed the same week she lost her job, its principal dismissed along with all the other teachers. Mazbouh says she doesn’t blame the school for the closure. “Our economic situation is very hard,” she says. “They have every right to shut down.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That was before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/04/world/middleeast/beirut-explosion-damage.html">the August 4 blast</a>. Initial reports indicate that more than <a href="https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/unicef-says-beirut-children-will-need-special-care-after-blast">120 schools were damaged by the explosion</a>, leaving some 55,000 students without physical classrooms. Lebanese authorities say they plan to host displaced families in those that haven’t been damaged. Together with the pandemic, it makes a return to the classroom this fall unlikely<strong> </strong>for many students in Lebanon. For those schools that do try to stay in session, WhatsApp may be a solution to the myriad challenges they face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carla Najem, a psychologist at the American University of Beirut Medical Center, says prolonged time out of the classroom may have serious repercussions for Lebanese students. “Our basic needs are not being met right now,” says Najem. “[Students] are going through a lot mentally and emotionally.”</p>



<p>Even as conditions in an ailing Lebanon deteriorate, Najem says that certain aspects of distance learning, like sharing photos and videos, can ameliorate some of the long-term negative effects. “It’s much easier for children to grasp things if they live in a physical space that portrays it,” Najem says. “Maybe we need to use those things as an opportunity to help children connect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Najem says we have a lot to learn from students, even as they face a daunting new school year. “Children are very resilient,” she explains. “They adapt much quicker than adults.”</p>

    <p>I wanted to install the latest version of zsh on my MacBook Pro. This is
usually the first thing I install when setting up a new machine. A <code>brew
install zsh</code> and a <code>chsh</code> later and I'm good to go (well, technically I had to
add the homebrew location of zsh to <code>/etc/shells</code> as well). Close out
Terminal.app and reopen to make sure my changes took effect, and sure enough,
there's my zsh prompt. </p>
<p>Yes, I know macOS Catalina ships with zsh as the default shell, but I want to
make sure I have the latest... just because.</p>
<p>Curiosity strikes in and I wonder, even though the homebrew location of zsh is
configured as my shell, am I actually using it?</p>
<h2>which</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % which zsh</span>
<span>/usr/local/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Hold on. I want the full location.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % ls -la $(which zsh)</span>
<span>lrwxr-xr-x  1 wally  admin  27 Dec 28 20:28 /usr/local/bin/zsh -&gt; ../Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Yup, that looks about right. </p>
<p>But wait... that only told me the location of zsh the executable which is only
correct because I added homebrew's <code>/usr/local/bin</code> location to my <code>PATH</code>. That is literally
the first line of the man page for <code>which</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>WHICH</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>                  <span>BSD</span> <span>General</span> <span>Commands</span> <span>Manual</span>                 <span>WHICH</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>NAME</span>
     <span>which</span> <span>-- locate a program file in the user's path</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That means that if I were to execute <code>zsh</code> from my current shell a new instance
of zsh from <code>/usr/local/bin/zsh</code> would begin. This doesn't tell me the location
of the shell I'm currently typing in which started after opening Terminal.app.</p>
<h2>$SHELL</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % echo $SHELL</span>
<span>/usr/local/bin/zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Eh, I don't know. That tells me that it's configured as my shell but does not
necessarily tell me the location of the shell I'm currently typing in.</p>
<h2>ps</h2>
<p>Maybe I can find the currently running process of the instance of zsh I'm in right now.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % ps </span>
<span>  PID TTY           TIME CMD</span>
<span>78525 ttys003    0:00.11 -zsh</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Well that still doesn't give me the full path. And is that even the right
process? How do I get the PID of the shell I'm currently typing in? Turns out
there's a convenient shell variable <code>$$</code>.</p>



<p>Hmm, that's good I suppose, but I still don't know if the process with PID
<code>78525</code>, the one I'm currently typing in, is the correct zsh.</p>
<h2>lsof</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I probably should have used <code>lsof</code> a long time ago but knowing how to
get the PID of the current shell makes things a bit easier.</p>

<p>Ahhh, finally! Not a single of instance of <code>/bin/zsh</code> in the output. I think
I'm pretty happy with this result.</p>
<h2>Are There Other Ways?</h2>
<p>But now I'm even more curious. Are there other ways to find this same
information? Turns out <code>apropos process</code> returned a few results but of the
bunch the only interesting find was <code>fuser</code>. </p>
<h2>fuser</h2>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % fuser /usr/local/Cellar/zsh/5.7.1/bin/zsh             </span>

<p>Neat. That PID matches <code>$$</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>~ % fuser /bin/zsh</span>
<span>/bin/zsh: </span>
</pre></div>


<p>And no results for the pre-installed macOS version of <code>/bin/zsh</code>. </p>
<h2>macOS Activity Monitor</h2>
<p>If you want a more point-and-click way of finding the same information then
Activity Monitor has you covered. Make sure View &gt; Applications in last 12
hours is selected. Expand Terminal.app and double click zsh. Clicking the
Sample button on the bottom left gives you some detailed information about that
running process. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen shot showing layered windows of macOS Activity Monitor and a process sample output of zsh" src="https://nil.wallyjones.com/images/activity-monitor-zsh.png"></p>
<p>Fun fact: you can use the <code>sample</code> command for the same information.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finding the shell you're <em>actually</em> using isn't all that simple at first. You
can find the location of the executable of the shell. You can find all
the processes currently running with that shell name. But gathering information
about the shell you're typing all those commands in to find the shell you're
using requires a little more poking around. The two easiest solutions, on macOS
at least, are <code>lsof</code> and <code>fuser</code>. Activity Monitor also offers up a GUI for
finding the same information but you need to how to dig into it.</p>

      <p>This blog post explains the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> and the corresponding new PyTorch <a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="main-contributions">Main contributions</h2>
<p>We introduce a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function.</p>

<p>The new energy function is a generalization (discrete states \(\Rightarrow\) continuous states) of <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> aka <strong>Dense Associative Memories</strong> introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01929">Demircigil et al.</a>
The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exponential storage capacity</li>
  <li>extremely fast convergence</li>
</ul>

<p>Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention Is All You Need</a>.
We use these new insights to analyze transformer models in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-blog-post-is-about">What this blog post is about</h2>

<p>This blog post is split into three parts. First, we make the transition from traditional Hopfield Networks towards <strong>modern Hopfield Networks</strong> and their generalization to continuous states through our <strong>new energy function</strong>. Second, the properties of our new energy function and the connection to the self-attention mechanism of transformer networks is shown. Finally, we introduce and explain a new PyTorch layer (<a href="https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers">Hopfield layer</a>), which is built on the insights of our work. We show several practical use cases, i.e. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13505">Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification</a>, Hopfield pooling, and associations of two sets.</p>

<h2 id="from-classical-hopfield-networks-to-self-attention">From classical Hopfield Networks to self-attention</h2>

<p><strong>Associative memories</strong> are one of the earliest artificial neural models dating back to the 1960s and 1970s. Best known are <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">Hopfield Networks</a>, presented by John Hopfield in 1982.
As the name suggests, the main purpose of associative memory networks is to associate an input with its most similar pattern. In other words, the purpose is to store and retrieve patterns.
We start with a review of classical Hopfield Networks.</p>

<h3 id="hopfield-networks">Hopfield Networks</h3>

<p>The simplest associative memory is just a <strong>sum of outer products</strong> of the \(N\) patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) that we want to store (Hebbian learning rule). In classical Hopfield Networks these patterns are polar (binary), i.e. \(\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1 \}^d\), where \(d\) is the length of the patterns. The corresponding weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_i^N \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ . \tag{1}
\end{equation}\]

<p>The weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) stores the patterns, which can be retrieved starting with a <strong>state pattern</strong> \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>From now on we denote the \(N\) <strong>stored patterns</strong> as \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) and any <strong>state pattern</strong> or <strong>state</strong> as \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\).</p>

<hr>

<p>The basic <strong>synchronuous update rule</strong> is to repeatedly multiply the state pattern \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\), subtract the bias and take the sign:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} =  \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{\xi}^t - \boldsymbol{b}) \ , \tag{2}
\label{eq:restorage}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a bias vector, which can be interpreted as threshold for every component.
The <strong>asynchronous update rule</strong> performs this update only for one component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) and then selects the next component for update.
Convergence is reached if \(\boldsymbol{\xi^{t+1}} = \boldsymbol{\xi^{t}}\).</p>

<p>The asynchronous version of the update rule of Eq. \eqref{eq:restorage} minimizes the <strong>energy function</strong> \(\text{E}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\text{E} = -\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{\xi}^T \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^T\boldsymbol{b} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d\sum_{j=1}^d w_{ij}\xi_i\xi_j + \sum_{i=1}^d b_i\xi_i \ . \tag{3}
\label{eq:energy_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>As derived in the papers of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=58341">Bruck</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X85900290">Goles-Chacc et al.</a> and <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7427/1/HOPpnas82.pdf">the original Hopfield paper</a>, the convergence properties are dependent on the structure of the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\) and the method by which the nodes are updated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For asynchronous updates with \(w_{ii} \geq 0\) and \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state.</li>
  <li>For synchronous updates with \(w_{ij} = w_{ji}\), the updates converge to a stable state or a limit cycle of length 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the asynchronous update rule and symmetric weights, \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) \leq \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) holds. When \(\text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t+1}) = \text{E}(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{t})\) for the update of every component of \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^t\), a local minimum in \(\text{E}\) is reached.
All stored patterns \(\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}_{i=1}^N\) should be fixed points of the Hopfield Network, i.e.</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x}_i = \text{sgn}(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{x}_i - \boldsymbol{b}) \ . \tag{4}
\end{equation}\]

<p>They should even be local minima of \(\text{E}\).</p>

<p>In the following example, no bias vector is used. This means that taking the inverse image, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</p>

<p>We start with an <strong>illustrative example</strong> of a Hopfield Network. <strong>One input image</strong> should first be stored and then be retrieved.
The input image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_original.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>Since an associative memory has <strong>polar states and patterns</strong> (or binary states and patterns), we convert the input image to a black and white image:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>The <strong>weight matrix</strong> \(\boldsymbol{W}\) is the outer product of this black and white image \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}} \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ , \tag{5}
\label{eq:weight_matrix}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where for this example \(d = 64 \times 64\).</p>

<p>Can the original image be restored if half of the pixels are masked out? The masked image is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked.png" alt="not found" width="300px"></p>

<p>which is our inital state \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\). This inital state is updated via multiplication with the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}\).
It takes one update until the original image is restored.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/single_pat_img/homer_bw_masked_retrieved.png" alt="not found" width="600px"></p>

<p>What happens if we store <strong>more than one pattern</strong>? The weight matrix is then built from the sum of outer products of <strong>three stored patterns</strong> (three input images):</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \boldsymbol{x}_i \boldsymbol{x}_i^T \ , \qquad \boldsymbol{x}_i \in \{ -1,1\}^d \ . \tag{6}
\end{equation}\]

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_6.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_12.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>In this figure, the left hand side shows the three stored patterns, and the right hand side shows masked state patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}\) together with the retrieved patterns \(\boldsymbol{\xi}^{\text{new}}\).</p>

<p>Looking at the upper row of images might suggest that the retrieval process is no longer perfect. But there are two interesting facts to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masking the original images introduces many pixel values of \(-1\). We therefore have the odd behavior that the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Bart}}\rangle\) is larger than the inner product \(\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}^{\text{masked}},\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\rangle\).</li>
  <li>As stated above, if no bias vector is used, the inverse of the pattern, i.e. flipping all pixels at once, results in the same energy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the retrieval of the upper image looks incorrect, it is de facto correct. However, for the lower row example, the retrieval is no longer correct.
The weights of \(2 \cdot \boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Marge}}\) have simply overwritten the weights of \(\boldsymbol{x}_{\text{Homer}}\).
For both examples, only the retrieval after the first update step is shown, but the results do not change when performing further update steps.
The next figure shows the Hopfield Network retrieval for 6 patterns.</p>

<p><img src="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/assets/multi_pat_img/experiment_115.png" alt="not found"></p>

<p>Clearly, retrieving the patterns is imperfect. One might suspect that the limited storage capacities of Hopfield Networks, see <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.3548&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Amit et al.</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.061910">Torres et al</a>, is the problem.
However, we show now that the storage capacity is not directly responsible for the imperfect retrieval.
The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns free of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong \frac{d}{2\log(d)} \ , \tag{7}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield}
\end{equation}\]

<p>where \(d\) is the dimension of the input.</p>

<p>The storage capacity for <strong>retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors</strong> is:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
C \cong 0.14 d\ . \tag{8}
\label{eq:storage_hopfield2}
\end{equation}\]

<p>In the example, the storage capacity is \(C \cong 0.14 d = 0.14 \cdot 64 \cdot 64 \sim 570\).
Thus, insufficient storage capacity is not directly responsible for the retrieval errors.
Instead, the example patterns are correlated, therefore the retrieval has errors.</p>

<p>Consequently, we need a model which <strong>allows pulling apart close patterns</strong>, such that (strongly) <strong>correlated patterns can be distinguished</strong>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>On storage capacity</strong></p>

<p>The storage capacities stated in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield} and in Eq. \eqref{eq:storage_hopfield2} are derived for \(w_{ii}=0\).
Recently, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> analyzed the storage capacity for Hopfield Networks with \(w_{ii}\geq 0\). Also for \(w_{ii}\geq 0\), a storage capacity of \(C \cong 0.14 d\)
for retrieval of patterns with a small percentage of errors was observed. The ratio \(C/d\) is often called <strong>load parameter</strong> and denoted by \(\alpha\). <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00144/full">Folli et al.</a> showed that there is a second regime with very large \(\alpha\), where the storage capacity is much higher, i.e. more fixed points exist. However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07741">Rocci et al.</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/8/726/htm">Gosti et al.</a> reported that these fixed points for very large \(\alpha\) are unstable and do not have an attraction basin.</p>

<p>The storage capacity is a crucial characteristic of Hopfield Networks. <strong>Modern Hopfield Networks</strong> (aka Dense Associative Memories) introduce a new energy function instead of the energy in Eq. \eqref{eq:energy_hopfield} to create a higher storage capacity. <strong>Discrete</strong> modern Hopfield Networks have been introduced first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164">Krotov and Hopfield</a> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>In my previous posts on loss aversion (<a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/09/10/kahneman-and-tverskys-debatable-loss-aversion-assumption/">here</a>, <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/11/06/what-can-we-infer-about-someone-who-rejects-a-5050-bet-to-win-110-or-lose-100-the-rabin-paradox-explored/">here</a> and <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/12/05/the-case-against-loss-aversion/">here</a>), I foreshadowed a post on how “ergodicity economics” might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people’s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I’ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</p>
<p>The below is largely drawn from presentations and papers by <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/">Ole Peters</a> and <a href="http://lml.org.uk/research/economics/">friends</a>, with my own evolutionary take at the end. For a deeper dive, see the <a href="https://ergodicityeconomics.com/lecture-notes/">lecture notes by Peters and Alexander Adamou</a>, or a recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0">Perspective by Peters in Nature Physics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The choice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have $100 and are offered a gamble involving a series of coin flips. For each flip, heads will increase your wealth by 50%. Tails will decrease it by 40%. Flip 100 times.</p>
<p><strong>The expected payoff</strong></p>
<p>What will happen? For that first flip, you have a 50% chance of a $50 gain, and a 50% chance of a $40 loss. Your expected gain (each outcome weighted by its probability, 0.5*$50 + 0.5*-$40) is $5 or 5% of your wealth. The absolute size of the stake for future flips will depend on past flips, but for every flip you have the same expected gain of 5% of your wealth.</p>
<p>Should you take the bet?</p>
<p>I simulated 10,000 people who each started with $100 and flipped the coin 100 times each. This line in Figure 1 represents the mean wealth of the 10,000 people. It looks good, increasing roughly in accordance with the expected gain, despite some volatility, and finishing at a mean wealth of over $16,000.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1: Average wealth of population</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_1.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Yet people regularly decline gambles of this nature. Are they making a mistake?</p>
<p>One explanation for declining this gamble is risk aversion. A risk averse person will value the expected outcome of a gamble lower than the same sum with certainty.</p>
<p>Risk aversion can be represented through the concept of utility, where each level of wealth gives subjective value (utility) for the gambler. If people maximise utility instead of the value of a gamble, it is possible that a person would reject the bet.</p>
<p>For example, one common utility function to represent a risk averse individual is to take the logarithm of each level of wealth. If we apply the log utility function to the gamble above, the gambler will reject the offer of the coin flip. [The maths here is simply that the expected utility of the gamble is 0.5*<em>ln</em>(150) + 0.5*<em>ln</em>(60)=4.55, which is less than the utility of the sure $100, <em>ln</em>(100)=4.61.]</p>
<p><strong>The time average growth rate</strong></p>
<p>For a different perspective, below is the plot for the first 20 of these 10,000 people. Interestingly, only two people do better than break even (represented by the black line at $100). The richest has less than $1,000 at period 100.</p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Path of first 20 people</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_2.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>What is happening here? The first plot shows that the average wealth across all 10,000 people is increasing. When we look at the first 20 individuals, their wealth generally declines. Even those that make money make less than the gain in aggregate wealth would suggest.</p>
<p>To show this more starkly, here is a plot of the first 20 people on a log scale, together with the average wealth for the full population. They are all below average in final wealth.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3: Plot of first 20 people against average wealth (log scale)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_3.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 3"></p>
<p>If we examine the full population of 10,000, we see an interesting pattern. The mean wealth is over $16,000, but the median wealth after 100 periods is 51 cents, a loss of over 99% of the initial wealth. 54% of the population ends up with less than $1. 86% finishes with less than the initial wealth of $100. Yet 171 people end up with more than $10,000. The wealthiest person finishes with $117 million, which is over 70% of the total wealth of the population.</p>
<p>For most people, the series of bets is a disaster. It looks good only on average, propped up by the extreme good luck and massive wealth of a few people. The expected payoff does not match the experience of most people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Four possible outcomes</em></strong></p>
<p>One way to think about what is happening is to consider the four possible outcomes over the first two periods.</p>
<p>The first person gets two heads. They finish with $225. The second and third person get a heads and a tails (in different orders), and finish with $90. The fourth person ends up with $36.</p>
<p>The average across the four is $110.25, reflecting the compound 5% growth. That’s our positive picture. But three of the four lost money. As the number of flips increases, the proportion who lose money increases, with a rarer but more extraordinarily rich cohort propping up the average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Almost surely</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the very long-term, an individual will tend to get around half heads and half tails. As the number of flips goes to infinite, the number of heads and tails is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">almost surely</a>” equal.</p>
<p>This means that each person will tend to get a 50% increase half the time (or 1.5 times the initial wealth), and a 40% decrease half the time (60% of the initial wealth). A bit of maths and the time average growth in wealth for an individual is (1.5*0.6)<sup>0.5</sup> ~ 0.95, or approximately a 5% decline in wealth each period. Every individual’s wealth will tend to decay at that rate.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for this, a long run of equal numbers of heads and tails is equivalent to flipping a head and a tail every two periods. Suppose that is exactly what you did – flipped a heads and then flipped a tail. Your wealth would increase to $150 in the first round ($100*1.5), and then decline to $90 in the second ($150*0.6). You get the same result if you change the order. Effectively, you are losing 10% (or getting only 1.5*0.6=0.9) of your money every two periods.</p>
<p>A system where the time average converges to the ensemble average (our population mean) is known as an ergodic system. The system of gambles above is non-ergodic as the time average and the ensemble average diverge. And given we cannot individually experience the ensemble average, we should not be misled by it. The focus on ensemble averages, as is typically done in economics, can be misleading if the system is non-ergodic.</p>
<p><strong><em>The longer term</em></strong></p>
<p>How can we reconcile this expectation of loss when looking at the time average growth with the continued growth of the wealth of some people after 100 periods? It does not seem that everyone is “almost surely” on the path to ruin.</p>
<p>But they are. If we plot the simulation for, say, 1,000 periods rather than 100, there are few winners. Here’s a plot of the average wealth of the population for 1000 periods (the first 100 being as previously shown), plus a log plot of that same growth (Figures 4 and 5).</p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_4.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 4"></p>
<p><em>Figure 5: Plot of average wealth over 1000 periods (log plot)</em><br>
<img src="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/non_ergodic_figure_5.jpeg?w=1100" alt="Figure 5"></p>
<p>We can see that despite a large peak in wealth around period 400, wealth ultimately plummets. Average wealth at period 1000 is $24, below the starting average of $100, with a median wealth of 1×10<sup>-21</sup> (rounding to the nearest cent, that is zero). The wealthiest person has $242 thousand dollars, with that being 98.5% of the total wealth. If we followed that wealthy person for another 1000 generations, I would expect them to be wiped out too. [I tested that – at 2000 periods the wealthiest person had $4×10<sup>-7</sup>.] Despite the positive expected value, the wealth of the entire population is wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Losing wealth on a positive value bet</strong></p>
<p>The first 100 periods of bets forces us to hold a counterintuitive idea in our minds. While the population as an aggregate experiences outcomes reflecting the positive expected value of the bet, the typical person does not. The increase in wealth across the aggregate population is only due to the extreme wealth of a few lucky people.</p>
<p>However, the picture over 1000 periods appears even more confusing. The positive expected value of the bet is nowhere to be seen. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>The answer to this lies in the distribution of bets. After 100 periods, one person had 70% of the wealth. We no longer have 10,000 equally weighted independent bets as we did in the first round. Instead, the path of the wealth of the population is largely subject to the outcome of the bets by this wealthy individual. As we have already shown, the wealth path for an individual almost surely leads to a compound 5% loss of wealth. That individual’s wealth is on borrowed time. The only way for someone to maintain their wealth would be to bet a smaller portion of their wealth, or to diversify their wealth across multiple bets.</p>
<p><strong>The Kelly criterion</strong></p>
<p>On the first of these options, the portion of a person’s wealth they should enter as stakes for a positive expected value bet such as this is given by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">Kelly Criterion</a>. The Kelly criterion gives the bet size that would maximise the geometric growth rate in wealth.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion formula for a simple bet is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D%5Cfrac%7Bbp-q%7D%7Bb%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bp%28b%2B1%29-1%7D%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=1" alt="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}" title="f=\frac{bp-q}{b}=\frac{p(b+1)-1}{b}"></p>
<p>where</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <em>f</em> is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager</p>
<p>  <em>b</em> is the net odds received on the wager (i.e. you receive $b back on top of the $1 wagered for the bet)</p>
<p>  <em>p</em> is the probability of winning</p>
<p>  <em>q</em> is the probability of losing (1-p)
</p></blockquote>
<p>For the bet above, we have <em>p</em>=0.5 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Cfrac%7B0.5%7D%7B0.4%7D%3D1.25&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25" title="b=\frac{0.5}{0.4}=1.25">. As offered, we are effectively required to bet <em>f</em>=0.4, or 40% of our wealth, for that chance to win a 50% increase.</p>
<p>However, if we apply the above formula given <em>p</em> and <em>b</em>, a person should bet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%280.5%2A%281.25%2B1%29-1%29%7D%7B1.25%7D%3D0.1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1" title="\frac{(0.5*(1.25+1)-1)}{1.25}=0.1">, or 10%, of their wealth each round to maximise the geometric growth rate.</p>
<p>The Kelly criterion is effectively maximising the expected log utility of the bet through setting the size of the bet. The Kelly criterion will result in someone wanting to take a share of any bet with positive expected value.</p>
<p>The Kelly bet “almost surely”” leads to higher wealth than any other strategy in the long run.</p>
<p>If we simulate the above scenarios, but risking only 10% of wealth each round rather than 40% (i.e. heads wealth will increase by 12.5%, tails it will decrease by 10%), what happens? The expected value of the Kelly bet is 0.5*0.125+0.5*-0.1=0.0125 …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <p><span>“So what does a game designer do? Are you an artist? Do you design characters and write the story? Or no, wait, you’re a programmer?”</span></p>
<p>Game design is one of those nebulous terms to people outside the game industry that’s about as clear as the “astrophysicist” job title is to me. It’s also my job, so I find myself explaining what game design means to a lot of people from different backgrounds, some of whom don’t know anything about games.</p>
<h2>The Door Problem</h2>
<p>I like to describe my job in terms of “The Door Problem”.</p>
<p>Premise: You are making a game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there doors in your game?</li>
<li>Can the player open them?</li>
<li>Can the player open every door in the game?</li>
<li>Or are some doors for decoration?</li>
<li>How does the player know the difference?</li>
<li>Are doors you can open green and ones you can’t red? Is there trash piled up in front of doors you can’t use? Did you just remove the doorknobs and call it a day?</li>
<li>Can doors be locked and unlocked?</li>
<li>What tells a player a door is locked and will open, as opposed to a door that they will never open?</li>
<li>Does a player know how to unlock a door? Do they need a key? To hack a console? To solve a puzzle? To wait until a story moment passes?</li>
<li>Are there doors that can open but the player can never enter them?</li>
<li>Where do enemies come from? Do they run in from doors? Do those doors lock afterwards?</li>
<li>How does the player open a door? Do they just walk up to it and it slides open? Does it swing open? Does the player have to press a button to open it?</li>
<li>Do doors lock behind the player?</li>
<li>What happens if there are two players? Does it only lock after both players pass through the door?</li>
<li>What if the level is REALLY BIG and can’t all exist at the same time? If one player stays behind, the floor might disappear from under them. What do you do?</li>
<li>Do you stop one player from progressing any further until both are together in the same room?</li>
<li>Do you teleport the player that stayed behind?</li>
<li>What size is a door?</li>
<li>Does it have to be big enough for a player to get through?</li>
<li>What about co-op players? What if player 1 is standing in the doorway – does that block player 2?</li>
<li>What about allies following you? How many of them need to get through the door without getting stuck?</li>
<li>What about enemies? Do mini-bosses that are larger than a person also need to fit through the door?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a pretty classic design problem. SOMEONE has to solve The Door Problem, and that someone is a designer.</p>
<h2>The Other Door Problems</h2>
<p>To help people understand the role breakdowns at a big company, I sometimes go into how other people deal with doors.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Creative Director</span>: “Yes, we definitely need doors in this game.”</li>
<li><strong>Project Manager</strong>: “I’ll put time on the schedule for people to make doors.”</li>
<li><span>Designer</span>: “I wrote a doc explaining what we need doors to do.”</li>
<li><span>Concept Artist</span>: “I made some gorgeous paintings of doors.”</li>
<li><span>Art Director</span>: “This third painting is exactly the style of doors we need.”</li>
<li><span>Environment Artist</span>: “I took this painting of a door and made it into an object in the game.”</li>
<li><span>Animator</span>: “I made the door open and close.”</li>
<li><strong>Sound Designer</strong>: “I made the sounds the door creates when it opens and closes.”</li>
<li><strong>Audio Engineer</strong>: “The sound of the door opening and closing will change based on where the player is and what direction they are facing.”</li>
<li><strong>Composer</strong>: “I created a theme song for the&nbsp;door.”</li>
<li><span>FX Artist</span>: “I added some cool sparks to the door when it opens.”</li>
<li><strong>Writer</strong>: “When the door opens, the player will say, ‘Hey look! The door opened!’ “</li>
<li><span>Lighter</span>: “There is a bright red light over the door when it’s locked, and a green one when it’s opened.”</li>
<li><span>Legal</span>: “The environment artist put a Starbucks logo on the door. You need to remove that if you don’t want to be sued.”</li>
<li><strong>Character Artist</strong>: “I don’t really care about this door until it can start wearing hats.”</li>
<li><span>Gameplay Programmer</span>: “This door asset now opens and closes based on proximity to the player. It can also be locked and unlocked through script.”</li>
<li><strong>AI Programmer:</strong> “Enemies and allies now know if a door is there and whether they can go through it.”</li>
<li><strong>Network&nbsp;Programmer:</strong> “Do all the players need to see the door open at the same time?”</li>
<li><strong>Release Engineer</strong>: “You need to get your doors in by 3pm if you want them on the disk.”</li>
<li><strong>Core Engine Programmer:&nbsp;</strong>“I have optimized the code to allow up to 1024 doors in the game.”</li>
<li><strong>Tools Programmer:</strong> “I made it even easier for you to place doors.”</li>
<li><span>Level Designer</span>: “I put the door in my level and locked it. After an event, I unlocked it.”</li>
<li><strong>UI Designer</strong>: “There’s now an objective marker on the door, and it has its own icon on the map.”</li>
<li><strong>Combat Designer</strong>: “Enemies will spawn behind doors, and lay cover fire as their allies enter the room. Unless the player is looking inside the door in which case they will spawn behind a different door.”</li>
<li><strong>Systems&nbsp;Designer</strong>: “A&nbsp;level 4 player&nbsp;earns 148xp for opening this door at the cost of 3 gold.”</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Designer</strong>: “We could charge the player $.99 to open the door now, or wait 24 hours for it to open automatically.”</li>
<li><span>QA Tester</span>: “I walked to the door. I ran to the door. I jumped at the door. I stood in the doorway until it closed. I saved and reloaded and walked to the door. I died and reloaded then walked to&nbsp;the door. I threw grenades at the door.”</li>
<li><strong>UX / Usability Researcher</strong>: “I found some people on Craigslist to go through the door so we could see what problems crop&nbsp;up.”</li>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Localization</strong>: “Door. Puerta. Porta. Porte.&nbsp;Tür. Dør. Deur. Drzwi. Drws.&nbsp;문”</li>
<li><strong>Producer</strong>: “Do we need to give everyone those&nbsp;doors or can we save them for a pre-order bonus?”</li>
<li><strong>Publisher</strong>: “Those doors&nbsp;are really going to help this game stand out during the fall line-up.”</li>
<li><strong>CEO:</strong> “I want you all to know how much I appreciate the time and effort put into making those doors.”</li>
<li><strong>PR</strong>: “To all our fans, you’re going to go&nbsp;crazy over our next reveal #gamedev #doors #nextgen #retweet”</li>
<li><strong>Community Manager</strong>: “I let the fans know that their concerns about doors will be addressed in the upcoming&nbsp;patch.”</li>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong>: “A player contacted us,&nbsp;confused about doors. I gave them detailed instructions on how to use them.”</li>
<li><span>Player</span>: “I totally didn’t even notice a door there.”</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I like this example is because it’s so mundane. There’s an impression that game design is flashy and cool and about crazy ideas and fun all the time. But when I start off with, “Let me tell you about doors…” it cuts straight to the everyday practical considerations.</p>
<p><em>Recent edits:&nbsp;Added&nbsp;localization, character artist, system designer, combat designer, composer, audio engineer, monetization designer, and I think that’ll be it for now.</em></p>

            <p>Do you work with Postgres on a daily basis? Write application code that talks
to Postgres? Then check out the bite-sized SQL snippets below that can help
you work faster!</p>

<h3 id="insert-multiple-rows-in-one-statement">Insert Multiple Rows In One Statement</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement can insert more than one row in a single statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>planets</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>gravity</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'earth'</span><span>,</span>    <span>9</span><span>.</span><span>8</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'mars'</span><span>,</span>     <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>7</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'jupiter'</span><span>,</span> <span>23</span><span>.</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-a-row-and-return-automatically-assigned-values">Insert a Row and Return Automatically-assigned Values</h3>

<p>Values auto-generated with DEFAULT/serial/IDENTITY constructs can be returned
by the INSERT statement using the RETURNING clause. From the application
code perspective, such an INSERT is executed like a SELECT that returns a
recordset.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- table with 2 column values auto-generated on INSERT</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>slno</span>       <span>serial</span>      <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>name</span>       <span>text</span>        <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>created_at</span> <span>timestamptz</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>slno</span><span>,</span> <span>created_at</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--      name     | slno |          created_at</span>
<span>-- --------------+------+-------------------------------</span>
<span>--  wooden axe   |    1 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  loom         |    2 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span>
<span>--  eye of ender |    3 | 2020-08-17 05:35:45.962725+00</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="autogenerated-uuid-primary-keys">Autogenerated UUID Primary Keys</h3>

<p>UUIDs are sometimes used instead of primary keys for various reasons. Here is
how you can use an UUID instead of a serial or IDENTITY:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span>    <span>uuid</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>name</span>  <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'wooden axe'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'loom'</span><span>),</span>
            <span>(</span><span>'eye of ender'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>;</span>
  
<span>-- returns:</span>
<span>--                   id                  |     name</span>
<span>-- --------------------------------------+--------------</span>
<span>--  1cfaae8c-61ff-4e82-a656-99263b7dd0ae | wooden axe</span>
<span>--  be043a89-a51b-4d8b-8378-699847113d46 | loom</span>
<span>--  927d52eb-c175-4a97-a0b2-7b7e81d9bc8e | eye of ender</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="insert-if-not-existing-update-otherwise">Insert If Not Existing, Update Otherwise</h3>

<p>In Postgres 9.5 and later, you can <em>upsert</em> directly using the ON CONFLICT
construct:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>key</span>   <span>TEXT</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>-- when "key" causes a constraint violation, update the "value"</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> 
     <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'port'</span><span>,</span> <span>'5432'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ON</span> <span>CONFLICT</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>)</span> <span>DO</span>
            <span>UPDATE</span> <span>SET</span> <span>value</span><span>=</span><span>EXCLUDED</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="copy-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Copy Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>The INSERT statement has a form where the values can be supplied by a SELECT
statement. Use this to copy rows from one table into another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy between tables with similar columns </span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>pending_quests</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>progress</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- supply some values from another table, some directly</span>
  <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>archived_quests</span>
       <span>SELECT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>AS</span> <span>archival_date</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span>
         <span>FROM</span> <span>quests</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>completed</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’re looking to bulk-load tables, also check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a>,
which can be used to insert rows from a text or CSV file.</p>

<h3 id="delete-and-return-deleted-information">Delete and Return Deleted Information</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>RETURNING</code> clause to return values from the rows that were
deleted using a bulk-delete statement:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- return the list of customers whose licenses were deleted after expiry</span>
<span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>licenses</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>expiry_date</span>
  <span>RETURNING</span> <span>customer_name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="move-rows-from-one-table-into-another">Move Rows From One Table Into Another</h3>

<p>You can move rows from one table to another in a single statement, by using CTEs
with <em>DELETE .. RETURNING</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- move yet-to-start todo items from 2020 to 2021</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>ah_well</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>todos_2020</span>
          <span>WHERE</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>started</span>
      <span>RETURNING</span> <span>*</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>todos_2021</span>
            <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>ah_well</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="update-rows-and-return-updated-values">Update Rows and Return Updated Values</h3>

<p>The RETURNING clause can be used in UPDATEs too. Note that only the new
values of the updated columns can be returned this way.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- grant random amounts of coins to eligible players</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>coins</span> <span>=</span> <span>coins</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>random</span><span>())::</span><span>integer</span>
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>eligible</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>coins</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you need the original value of the updated columns: it is possible through a
self-join, but there is no guarantee of atomicity. Try using a <code>SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE</code> instead.</p>

<h3 id="update-a-few-random-rows-and-return-the-updated-ones">Update a Few Random Rows and Return The Updated Ones</h3>

<p>Here’s how you can choose a few random rows from a table, update them and
return the updated ones, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>WITH</span> <span>lucky_few</span> <span>AS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span>
      <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span>
  <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>random</span><span>()</span>
     <span>LIMIT</span> <span>5</span>
<span>)</span>
   <span>UPDATE</span> <span>players</span>
      <span>SET</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>=</span> <span>bonus</span> <span>+</span> <span>100</span> 
    <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>lucky_few</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNING</span> <span>id</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-a-table-just-like-another-table">Create a Table Just Like Another Table</h3>

<p>Use the CREATE TABLE .. LIKE construct to create a table with the same columns
as another:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By default this does not create similar indexes, constraints, defaults etc. To
do that, ask Postgres explicitly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>purchases</span> <span>INCLUDING</span> <span>ALL</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See the full syntax <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extract-a-random-set-of-rows-into-another-table">Extract a Random Set of Rows Into Another Table</h3>

<p>Since Postgres 9.5, the TABLESAMPLE feature is available to extract a sample of
rows from a table. There are two sampling methods currently, and <em>bernoulli</em> is
usually the one you want:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- copy 10% of today's purchases into another table</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>to_be_audited</span>
     <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
       <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
<span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <em>system</em> tablesampling method is faster, but does not return a uniform
distribution. See the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FROM">docs</a>
for more info.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-table-from-a-select-query">Create a Table From a Select Query</h3>

<p>You can use the CREATE TABLE .. AS construct to create the table and populate
it from a SELECT query, all in one go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>to_be_audited</span> <span>AS</span>
      <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
        <span>FROM</span> <span>purchases</span>
 <span>TABLESAMPLE</span> <span>bernoulli</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
       <span>WHERE</span> <span>transaction_date</span> <span>=</span> <span>CURRENT_DATE</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The resultant table is like a materialized view without a query associated with
it. Read more about <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html">CREATE TABLE .. AS here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="create-unlogged-tables">Create Unlogged Tables</h3>

<p><em>Unlogged</em> tables are not backed by WAL records. This means that updates and
deletes to such tables are faster, but they are not crash-tolerant and cannot
be replicated.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>report_20200817</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="create-temporary-tables">Create Temporary Tables</h3>

<p><em>Temporary</em> tables are implicitly unlogged tables, with a shorter lifetime. They
automatically self-destruct at the end of a session (default), or at the end
of the transaction.</p>

<p>Data within temporary tables cannot be shared across sessions. Multiple sessions
can create temporary tables with the same name.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- temp table for duration of the session</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span> <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- temp table that will self-destruct after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                      <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                      <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DROP</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- temp table that will TRUNCATE itself after current transaction</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TEMPORARY</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>scratch_20200817_run_12</span>
                       <span>(</span><span>LIKE</span> <span>report_v3</span><span>)</span>
                       <span>ON</span> <span>COMMIT</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>ROWS</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>



<p>Comments can be added to any object in the database. Many tools, including
pg_dump, understand these. A useful comment might just avoid a ton of trouble
during cleanup!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>idx_report_last_updated</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'needed for the nightly report app running in dc-03'</span><span>;</span>

<span>COMMENT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>TRIGGER</span> <span>tgr_fix_column_foo</span>
        <span>IS</span> <span>'mitigates the effect of bug #4857'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="advisory-locks">Advisory Locks</h3>

<p>Advisory locks can be used to co-ordinate actions between two apps connected to
the <em>same</em> database. You can use this feature to implement a global, distributed
mutex for a certain operation, for example. Read all about it <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS">here in the
docs</a>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- client 1: acquire a lock </span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- ... do work ...</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_unlock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>

<span>-- client 2: tries to do the same thing, but mutually exclusive</span>
<span>-- with client 1</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span> <span>-- blocks if anyone else has held lock with id 130</span>

<span>-- can also do it without blocking:</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>pg_try_advisory_lock</span><span>(</span><span>130</span><span>);</span>
<span>-- returns false if lock is being held by another client</span>
<span>-- otherwise acquires the lock then returns true</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregate-into-arrays-json-arrays-or-strings">Aggregate Into Arrays, JSON Arrays or Strings</h3>

<p>Postgres provides aggregate functions that concatenate values in a <em>GROUP</em> to
yield arrays, JSON arrays or strings:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- get names of each guild, with an array of ids of players that</span>
<span>-- belong to that guild</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>

<span>-- same but the player list is a CSV string</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but the player list is a JSONB array</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>jsonb_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>-- ...</span>
  
<span>-- same but returns a nice JSONB object like so:</span>
<span>-- { guild1: [ playerid1, playerid2, .. ], .. }</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>jsonb_object_agg</span><span>(</span><span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>players</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>AS</span> <span>guild_name</span><span>,</span> <span>array_agg</span><span>(</span><span>players</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>players</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>guilds</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>players</span> <span>ON</span> <span>players</span><span>.</span><span>guild_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>guilds</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>q</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="aggregates-with-order">Aggregates With Order</h3>

<p>While we’re on the topic, here’s how to set the order of values that are passed
to the aggregate function, <em>within each group</em>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- each state with a list of counties sorted alphabetically</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>string_agg</span><span>(</span><span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>','</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> <span>states</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>counties</span>
    <span>JOIN</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>counties</span><span>.</span><span>state_name</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>states</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Yes, there is a trailing ORDER BY clause inside the function call paranthesis.
Yes, the syntax is weird.</p>

<h3 id="array-and-unnest">Array and Unnest</h3>

<p>Use the ARRAY constructor to convert a set of rows, each with one column, into
an array.  The database driver (like JDBC) should be able to map Postgres arrays
into native arrays and might be easier to work with.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- convert rows (with 1 column each) into a 1-dimensional array</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>players</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>lifetime_spen…</span></code></pre></figure></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>With QFlow.ai coming out of beta, I wanted to share a bit about what QFlow.ai is and does, but also try to answer the question: why build QFlow.ai?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the problem. Both I and my co-founder have spent years in executive
positions (CFO, VP Finance, VP Operations, VP Marketing, etc.) at B2B companies. At each company, between sales,
marketing, customer success, and finance, <strong>we had a lot of tools generating a lot of data</strong>. But our organizations were by and large
stuck with outdated tools and skills to analyze that data.</p>
<p>Content Launchpad</p>

<li><a href="#different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates plans?</a></li>
<li><a href="#what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s next?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/DataSources.gif" alt="Lots of data, not much information"></p>
<h2 id="deceivingly-simple-but-important-questions-are-notoriously-difficult-to-answer-for-b2b-sales--marketing-professionals">Deceivingly simple but important questions are notoriously difficult to answer for B2B sales &amp; marketing professionals</h2>
<p>Often the simplest of questions that we ask of our data are difficult to answer reliably,
accurately, and efficiently. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the customer acquisition journey look like, from marketing, to sales, to customer success?</li>
<li>What programs, marketing campaigns, and sales tools are yielding the best outcomes? What about relative to cost?</li>
<li>How much time is it taking for our sales reps to follow up on an inbound lead?</li>
<li>What happened to the opportunities that made up the $XX million dollars in last month’s sales forecast?</li>
<li>What types of outbound sales activities are yielding productive vs. unproductive outcomes? Which sales behaviors can we model our playbook around?</li>
<li>How can we more accurately predict conversions? How can we more accurately forecast renewals?</li>
<li>Can we fix lead scoring and build trust between sales and marketing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-properly-analyze-a-b2b-business-a-data-warehouse-is-required-but-alone-is-insufficient">To properly analyze a B2B business, a data warehouse is required but alone is insufficient</h2>
<p>Addressing these questions with intellectual honesty turned out to be a slippery slope.
If we got engineering to stand up a data warehouse, we would then require a data engineering resource. If we got a data engineering resource, we
would then have to compete for her/his time and attention with more interesting projects.</p>
<p>And, even if we successfully had convinced a capable data engineer to help us maintain the data warehouse, that was just the
beginning. <strong>We would <em>still</em> need</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy lifting in terms of data transformation, far beyond the capabilities of SQL</li>
<li>to overcome disagreements / the lack of belief in marketing attribution models</li>
<li>to get stakeholders onboard across sales, marketing, finance, customer success, etc.</li>
<li>analysts to partner with data engineers, <strong>so we could derive <em>useful information</em> from the data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we had data, but found that too often it resulted in little useful information. Managing our business meant we needed to <strong>discard
“intuition” and embrace complex data</strong>, which in turn meant upgrading our organization’s tool set and skill set.
This simply wasn’t feasible most of the time.</p>
<p>So we built QFlow.ai. Because B2B customer-facing teams deserve to use a modern data toolset and its benefits.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qflow-ai">What is QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>QFlow.ai is a platform that enables B2B businesses to adopt machine learning, embrace complexity, and quickly answer the
questions that matter most. It works not by generating more data, but by using the <strong>data that you already have from</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salesforce.com (standard objects)</li>
<li>Your marketing automation platform (Marketo, Hubspot, Pardot, etc.)</li>
<li>Commonly used marketing platforms (e.g., Google Ads)</li>
<li>Optionally, any custom data that would be relevant to a machine learning model (more on that later)</li>
</ul>
<p>We built QFlow.ai specifically to capture the data needed to engineer a time series based dataset, with
an abstraction layer that sits on top and addresses idiosyncratic implementations of Salesforce.com.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with idiosyncratic business systems implementation, you might understandably have raised an eyebrow just now.</p>
<p>With the understanding each company is different, we built an account setup process that addresses differences in and
builds on  similarities in implementations. It works so well
that we’ve patented it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/qflow-ai-setup-wizard.png" alt="Simple setup abstracts away complexity"></p>
<p>Rather than spending days, weeks, or months setting up marketing attribution, our beta customers start getting value out of
QFlow.ai over the course of an early afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-qflowai-work">How does QFlow.ai work?</h2>
<p>Let’s address how QFlow.ai works at a high level.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, QFlow.ai creates a secure data warehouse for you and you alone — into which it pulls your corporate data</li>
<li>It uses existing data in your CRM and marketing platform to generate data visualizations and power machine learning recipes (more on that later)</li>
<li>It then re-assembles standard and, optionally, custom data to a format amenable to machine learning</li>
<li>And it works out of the box, requiring mere minutes of configuration — not days or months of setup / professional services
<img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/QFlow-Platform-Overview-Aug-2020.png" alt="QFlow Platform Basics"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-qflow-ai-do">What are the capabilities of QFlow.ai?</h2>
<p>As of August 2020, the Standard Plan QFlow.ai includes the following major features:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/attribution">multi-touch, multi-contact attribution</a></td>
<td>so marketing and sales can visualize what’s working to generate pipeline, and most importantly, deals</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://qflow.ai/products/campaign-measurement">campaign measurement views</a></td>

</table>
<h2 id="different-qflow-ai-plans">What differentiates QFlow.ai Standard from QFlow Pro? (Machine Learning Recipes)</h2>
<p>Originally, we planned on much more differentiation. But at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we made a decision to shove as much functionality as
possible into the QFlow.ai standard plan at a very low-friction price  ($699/mo paid annually, $899/mo paid monthly).</p>
<p>The primary difference between the two plans today is that <a href="https://qflow.ai/products/machine-learning">Machine Learning Recipes</a>
are available in Pro. This is not “machine learning” in a box. Instead, we’ve developed templates for machine learning
models that address common use cases in B2B. These templates are building blocks that, when deployed, are trained
and tuned machine learning models. <strong>We call these pre-built templates Machine Learning (ML) Recipes.</strong></p>
<p>Our two most popular Machine Learning recipes address <strong>lead scoring</strong> and <strong>opportunity scoring</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical Machine Learning recipe relies on standard information gleaned from your Salesforce.com and marketing platform integration,
but all recipes in our library can ingest <strong>custom data</strong> (e.g., product usage data, # API calls, seat utilization).</p>
<p>The inferred results from your ML jobs are available both on the QFlow.ai platform
and in your Salesforce.com instance. This way, your employees are able to orient their workday more intelligently without disruption.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.qflow.ai/images/p-convert-ml-recipe-process.png" alt="QFlow.ai Lead Scoring ML Recipe "></p>
<h2 id="what-is-next-for-qflow-ai">What’s on the roadmap for QFlow.ai</h2>
<p>We have built a lot in 9 short months, but there remains a lot to build. If you are a capable data scientist, devops
engineer, marketing or sales professional, or have a skill set that offers a unique contribution to our journey, we’re
interested in talking with you about a fulfilling job.</p>
<p><strong>It’s been humbling to see our earliest customers use QFlow.ai transform the way that they approach generating and retaining B2B revenue
in a cost-effective way.</strong> During our limited private beta, QFlow.ai generated insights for customers that saved hundreds of thousands
of dollars in ineffective spend, increased forecastable pipeline for sales team by 2.4x, and measurably
worked to get marketing, sales, and finance teams on the same page.</p>
<p>So, what’s next? More building, more listening. An occasional blog post to try to let you know what we’re up to.
And a couple dedicated features for Customer Success teams to complement our ML recipe that predicts and helps mitigate churn.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to join us on this journey, let us know by <a href="https://qflow.ai/contact-us">scheduling a time for a demo</a>.
Until then, we’ll be hard at work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to sort a list in Python, by following the below three steps:</p> <ol><li>Options to sort a list in Python<ul><li>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</li><li>An example of using “sort”</li><li>An example of using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>How to Sort a List in Reverse<ul><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sort”</li><li>Sort a list in Reverse using “sorted”</li></ul></li><li>Sort with a Custom Function using Key</li></ol> <h2>1. Options to sort a list in Python</h2> <p>There exist two main options, those are <code>sort()</code> and <code>sorted()</code>, let’s explore them below.</p> <h3>What is the difference between “sort” and “sorted”</h3> <p><code>list.sort()</code> changes the list in place and returns <code>None</code>.</p> <p><code>sorted()</code> takes an iterable and returns a new list, sorted.</p> <h3>An example of using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort()

# print the new list
print(new_list)
# result: None

print(our_list)
# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how it changes the list itself, but does not return a value to be placed into a new variable.</p> <h3>An example of using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'f', 'z']
</pre> <p>Notice how the changes are saved to the new list/variable.</p> <h2>2. How to Sort a List in Reverse</h2> <p>Using the above functions, it’s simple to sort a list in reverse. Just specify the <code>reverse</code> argument and set it to <code>True</code>.</p> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sort”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = our_list.sort(reverse=True)

print(our_list)
# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h3>Sort a List in Reverse using “sorted”</h3> <pre title=""># create a list of unordered items
our_list = ["f", "a", "c", "z", "b"]

# sort the list
new_list = sorted(our_list, reverse=True)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['z', 'f', 'c', 'b', 'a']
</pre> <h2>3. Sort with a Custom Function using Key</h2> <p>It is also possible to implement your own sorting method. This is done by adding a <code>key</code> parameter and setting it to a method.</p>  <p>For example:</p> <pre title=""># create a list of different length items
our_list = ["fasd", "asstt", "cqasf", "zqfwsef", "ba"]

# sort the list, by `len`
new_list = sorted(our_list, key=len)

# print the new list
print(new_list)

# result: ['ba', 'fasd', 'asstt', 'cqasf', 'zqfwsef']
</pre> <p>Just as we used <code>sorted</code> here, you could also have used <code>list.sort</code> as follows:</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len)
</pre> <p>As before, you can also combine the <code>reverse=True</code> argument should you want the reverse order.</p> <pre title="">our_list.sort(key=len, reverse=True)

# or

sorted(our_list, key=len, reverse=True)
</pre> <p>You could also swap out the use of the <code>len</code> method as the custom <code>key</code> with your own function, or lambda, to sort by some custom choice.</p> <p>For example:</p>  <pre title="">student_tuples = [('john', 'A', 15),('jane', 'B', 12),('dave', 'B', 10),]
sorted(student_tuples, key=lambda student: student[2]) 

# result: [('dave', 'B', 10), ('jane', 'B', 12), ('john', 'A', 15)]
</pre> <p>Or in another example:</p> <pre title="">lst = [('candy','30','100'), ('apple','10','200'), ('baby','20','300')]
lst.sort(key=lambda x:x[1])
print(lst)

# result: [('apple', '10', '200'), ('baby', '20', '300'), ('candy', '30', '100')]
</pre>  </div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Pull the Data you Actually Want – Why Events are an overused model]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><p><img alt="Pull doughnuts" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/doughnuts-90d02f03fc3e2d5704ed88886a47f9df.jpg"></p><p>There’s an underlying pattern prevalent today in many digital marketing tools that is causing problems. Wasted time, overpaying, slow velocity, and privacy issues for your customers are some of the results of this pattern. The problem is the over-reliance on Events. Specifically, the problem is that many marketing tools live in a world where they expect to be “pushed” data, when it would be so much better if they were “pulling” data when they needed it.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll explore the problems with event-based “Push” marketing &amp; analytics tools, and how we can fix them by switching to a “Pull” based solution, like the one that <a href="https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo">Grouparoo</a> is building.</p><h2>The Problems with “Push” and Events</h2><p>We have conducted interviews with over 70 marketing teams of all sizes throughout the world. What follows is a synthesis of some of the common problems they face with their current marketing tools.</p><h3>Overpaying</h3><p>One of the most telling critiques of event-based SaaS marketing tools is the fact that marketing teams are /actively/ pruning the events they are sending to control costs. Tools like Segment work best when you can build a robust profile of your customers' activity, but Segment charges you more when you store more data! Segment essentially holds their functionality hostage as you gain more users who in turn produce more events. Countless marketers lamented pain of having to decide which events to keep tracking versus which to stop tracking. Inevitably, a new campaign idea would hit them a few months later that would need the event that they stopped tracking. These teams and marketers just didn’t have the money to keep sending every event. This takes us to the Stale Data problem.</p><h3>Stale Data</h3><p>When using only events to model your customers, there’s a huge lag time between when you start capturing that data and when you can use it. For example, say you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven’t purchased in 6 months. If you start sending <code>purchase</code> events in June, the soonest you can start your campaign is December. Not only is that a long time to wait, but you’ve also sacrificed your team’s agility to modify those events or the campaign while you wait, <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/blog/the-shots-you-get-to-take">minimizing the shots you get to take</a>.</p><h3>Lost History</h3><p>In addition to the slow ramp up time for a new campaign based on events, there’s the problem of lost events. With poor mobile connections, errors on your web pages &amp; apps, slow vendors, and increasingly prevalent ad-blocking tools, it’s very easy to lose an event. Every marketer we talked to had their own less-than-scientific process they used to explain discrepancies between events and product data. Everyone had a different process and no one really trusted an event-based data source. If events are the only way you model your customers, it can be devastating if you miss a <code>changed-email-address</code> event - you might never be able to reach your customers at all!</p><p>Coupling this issue with the Stale Data problem, there’s no way to fully model customers you had before you started sending events. There’s no way to compare the profile you’ve built in Segment against your product database, where the customer’s data is actually stored with confidence.</p><h3>Privacy Nightmare</h3><p>Finally, there’s a challenging privacy story regarding events. You have a relationship with your customers and part of that relationship is based on trust. How sure are you that Segment or Mixpanel is storing your customers' data safely? How many other services do your events pass though on the way to them? Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager? AdMob? Facebook or Twitter Pixels? The list goes on and on. Any one of these vendors is a potential vector for attack, event theft, or event manipulation.</p><p>With regulations like GDPR and CCPA and many more on the way, you have a clear legal responsibility to keep your customers' data safe. Part of that responsibility is ensuring that the companies you share data with will update, delete, and anonymize data when <em>you</em> ask them too. What’s your process for doing that for all of your past events?</p><h2>The future is "Pull"</h2><p>How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing sources, of course!</p><p>Now, imagine you were starting to build a new marketing tool from scratch, like <a href="https://www.grouparoo.com/">Grouparoo</a> is. You aren’t burdened by the poor legacy choices of Segment, Mixpanel, and the rest. How would you build things if you were starting today? We would focus on pulling in data from our existing data sources. With Grouparoo, events are a way to augment your customer profiles, not the main source of critical data.</p><p>Grouparoo’s goal is to make it easy for non-technical members of your team to build robust customer profiles and groups. Then, they can synchronize that data in a safe way to communication and advertising partners. A highly-functioning digital marketing team can quickly add new profile properties, augment them with data from your product and data warehouse(s), and start running a new campaign in minutes, rather than weeks.</p><h3>Within your Firewall</h3><p>To be in the best position to pull in data, the Grouparoo application should be located within your company firewall. This means that Grouparoo should run on <em>your</em> servers and have (read) access to your databases. In this way, no data ever leaves your company’s control, and you can always inspect, audit, and change it. You don’t need to send your customer data over the open internet to a third party just to build a new cohort.</p><h3>Safe and Secure</h3><p>Since your customer data lives where it belongs on your servers, you can make changes and deletions as needed, and you can prove it. You can build a transparent GDPR/CCPA process at your company with Grouparoo. Grouparoo has robust access controls and logs to ensure that every profile and group is managed the way it should be.</p><h3>Cost Controls</h3><p>Since Grouparoo is running on your servers, there’s no additional cost to import more data. If you want to add more properties to your customer profiles to build more fine-grained groups and cohorts, then do it! Have you imported a facet you no longer need? Delete it! Grouparoo doesn't charge per event, or any other measure of data quantity, so you are free to experiment at will.</p><h3>Always up-to-date</h3><p>The “Pull” pattern has a wonderful property; Grouparoo can check up on the data whenever we are about to use it! This means that rather than waiting for an event to (possibly) be sent to Grouparoo to update a customer’s preferences or LTV, we can ask the primary source. Grouparoo will always re-import the properties of every profile before sending a communication to the customer, or syncing with a third party. This means that you can be sure that you’ll always be working with the latest customer preferences, purchase, email address, names, etc. when communicating with them. No lost events will prevent you from communicating effectively.</p><h3>Ready for ad-blocking technology by respecting consumer choices</h3><p>Finally, the pattern of tracking and sending <strong>so many</strong> events from our sites and applications is leading to more and more consumers blocking tools like Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics from getting any events at all. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking">major browsers are now shipping with defaults to prevent third-party tracking and cookies</a>. Rather than fight the modern privacy-conscious consumer because your marketing stack relies on events, embrace the choices they are making. Utilize your source-of-truth of their behavior and preferences you already have, your product database.</p><h2>Grouparoo’s Open-Source Promise</h2><p>There’s still a place for events in your marketing stack, but they shouldn’t be the primary source of any piece of customer data.
