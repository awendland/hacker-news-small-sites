<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€ enumerate_mappings()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/maps", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€ some_more_checks()
â”‚      â””â”€ copy_from_process()
â”‚
â””â”€ dump()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::header::write()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::thread_list_stream::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::mappings::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ elf_identifier_for_mapping()
   â”‚     â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::app_memory::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â””â”€ ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"nix::ptrace() error"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>PtraceError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>nix</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed to copy memory from process"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>CopyFromProcessError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>DumpError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Error during init phase"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>InitError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>InitError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(transparent)]</span>
    <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed when writing section AppMemory"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {
</span>     self.read_auxv()?;
     self.enumerate_threads()?;
     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>aaaaand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory: Failed to copy memory from process: nix::ptrace() error: EIO: I/O error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the last couple of years, I took close to two hundred interviews. These interviews range from Java engineers with two years of experience to architects holding more than fifteen years of experience. The first round of our interview process, irrespective of the candidate experience, involves solving a small problem in a Google document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I prefer Google docs because it removes the unnecessary fluff and most candidates are familiar with it. I understand that you may feel awkward and conscious when someone watches you while you are writing code. At the same time, it does give some understanding on how candidates keep calm under pressure, recover from their mistakes, and explain things.</p>



<p>I don’t expect people to write completely syntactically correct formatted code in Google docs. I give them 20 minutes of peaceful time to write the program. I once read that in other tech organizations, it is expected that you explain your approach and your thinking as you write code on a whiteboard (virtual or physical), but I prefer to give people an uninterrupted time so that they don’t have to do two things at a time. I try to make sure that they have understood the problem by giving them a couple of inputs and their expected output.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One question that I have used in most of our L1 interview rounds is shown below. Since 2021 I have stopped using this question so I thought it can be useful to share my analysis on how people performed in attempting this problem.</p>



<p><strong><em>You have to write a function that chunks an array into smaller arrays of specified size. For example, chunks([1,2,3,4,5] , 2) should return [[1,2],[3,4], [5]].</em></strong></p>



<p>Coming up with your own “Fizz Buzz Test”[1] is not easy. I came up with the following requirements on which I evaluate such coding questions [2].</p>



<ol><li>It should be a real problem. The kind of problem you solve in a real-world scenario.</li><li>It should feel simple and give confidence to the developer that they can solve it.</li><li>The solution should not require more than 20 lines of code.</li><li>The problem should not be domain specific that it gives advantage to some candidates.</li><li>It should not require any special data structure, which you don’t use in your day to day work.</li><li>Problem should not have a long text. Anyone should be able to read the problem text in less than a minute.</li><li>It should not require knowledge of a special library function.</li><li>A reasonable developer should be able to write the first version in 15-20 minutes. Candidates do tend to miss a few aspects of the problem, so it can involve more than one iteration.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>I have used this question for evaluating Java candidates only. It is possible that it is not a good question for your specific programming language. So, please keep </em></strong><strong><em>this point </em></strong><strong><em>in </em></strong><strong><em>your</em></strong><strong><em> mind.</em></strong></p>



<p>There are three skills that I am trying to evaluate about the candidate.</p>



<ol><li>Can they code?</li><li>Can they explain the code they have written?</li><li>Can they explain how they will test the code they have written?</li></ol>



<p>Coming back to the chunks problem, one possible Java solution is shown below.</p>


<pre title="">public static int[][] chunks(int[] numbers, int chunkSize) {
   int length = numbers.length;
   int resultArraySize = (length % chunkSize == 0) ? length / chunkSize : length / chunkSize + 1;
   int[][] result = new int[resultArraySize][];
 
   int numberArrIndex = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; resultArraySize; i++) {
       int chunkArraySize = i == resultArraySize - 1 &amp;&amp; (length % chunkSize != 0)
               ? length % chunkSize
               : chunkSize;
 
       int[] chunk = new int[chunkArraySize];
 
       for (int j = 0; j &lt; chunkArraySize; j++) {
           chunk[j] = numbers[numberArrIndex++];
       }
       result[i] = chunk;
   }
   return result;
}
</pre>


<p>Java 8 solution using the Stream API is shown below. I don’t expect candidates to write this version.</p>


<pre title="">public static int[][] chunk(int[] numbers, int size) {
   return IntStream.iterate(0, i -&gt; i + size)
           .limit((long) Math.ceil((double) numbers.length / size))
           .mapToObj(cur -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(numbers, cur, cur + size &gt; numbers.length ? numbers.length : cur + size))
           .toArray(int[][]::new);
}
</pre>


<p>My analysis is that only 10% of the total candidates solved the problem correctly in the first attempt. 30-40% missed a few scenarios and while explaining the solution they figured out the gaps and suggested improvements to fix their first version. And, remaining 50% failed to write even the partially correct first version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following are my observations on the attempts made by people:</p>



<ul><li>Candidates for some reason choose a function name different from chunks. I fail to understand why they don’t use function name as chunks. Some of the names used by candidates <em>getSmallArray</em>, <em>getChunksArray</em>, <em>getMeArray</em>, <em>getRefactorArray</em>, <em>getChunks</em>, <em>splitArrayInChunks</em>, <em>convertArray</em>, <em>splitArray</em>, <em>chunkInputArray</em>, etc.</li><li>Candidates who did well in the attempt first wrote chunks algorithm in plain English and then attempted to write code.</li><li>Candidates struggled to come up with the correct function declaration in the first go. They directly wrote the first version of the problem and then came up with the correct declaration.</li><li>Many candidates struggled with multi-dimensional array syntax.&nbsp;</li><li>The first solution written by most candidates didn’t handle the last chunk correctly. They created all chunks with equal size. So, the answer returned by their solution is [[1,2], [3,4], [5,0]]. Some candidates while explaining the solution with the example input figured out the problem and explained how they will handle this scenario.</li><li>Candidates struggled with the size of the result array. They need to consider whether the array is fully divisible by chunkSize or leaves a remainder.</li><li>Some candidates at times used String. They failed to make much progress.</li><li>Candidates make chunks an instance method of some class. They don’t think whether they should make the method static. For some reason, they think static is bad.</li><li>Some candidates prefer to convert an array to a List and then only they can write code.&nbsp;</li><li>Java developers still struggle with Generics. Only a handful of them were able to convert the program to a version that uses generics.</li><li>Only a handful of developers can eloquently explain the code they have written.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>By no means I am underestimating the pressure of giving an interview. Both taking a good interview and giving an interview are difficult. I know it is hard for most of us to write code when someone is watching us in an interview. But, given that this is the kind of code we write everyday and we do have to pair with others. I think it is still a better and scalable way to filter good candidates from average candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anjuna and AWS have closely collaborated over the last year to optimize Anjuna Enterprise Enclaves running on AWS Nitro Enclaves.</p>
<p>Secure enclaves establish a secure, comprehensive solution that protects data, applications, and storage from insiders and third parties wherever they’re executed and stored—on-premises, and in both private and public clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AWS Nitro Enclaves enable customers to further protect and securely process highly sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), healthcare, financial, and intellectual property within Amazon EC2 instances. Nitro Enclaves use the same Nitro Hypervisor technology that provides CPU and memory isolation for EC2 instances.</p>
<h2>Data is now secure by default.</h2>
<p>With Anjuna Enterprise Enclaves, data is secure by default. Anjuna builds on the enclave-enabling technology in Nitro Enclaves to extend data protection beyond memory and protection to storage and networks.</p>
<p>Anjuna’s “lift and shift” approach eliminates the need to work with ever-changing applications and software development kits (SDKs). And no changes to applications, recompilation, or operations are required.</p></span></p>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<p>The Colorado River toad—a.k.a. the Sonoran Desert toad—is flat and squat. No distinctive markings adorn its swampy olive skin, and while a passerby may remark upon its large size, the toad does little to draw attention to itself. And yet, for an animal so easy to miss or ignore, the amphibian provides a surprising asset for psychonauts: The Colorado River toad is the only animal source of “the God molecule”—5-MeO-DMT.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-5-meo-dmt-sonoran-desert-toad-venom-synthetic-psychedelic-plant-medicine-or-all-three"><span id="5-MeO_DMT_Sonoran_Desert_Toad_Venom_Synthetic_Psychedelic_Plant_Medicine_or_All_Three">5-MeO DMT: Sonoran Desert Toad Venom, Synthetic Psychedelic, Plant Medicine, or All Three?</span></h2>
<p>5-MeO-DMT is a potent psychedelic found within the excretion of the Colorado River toad (<em>Bufo alvarius </em>or<em> Incilius alvarius</em>). Although, it’s also present in some plants and can be <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/toad-venom-vs-synthetic-5-meo-dmt/">made synthetically</a>—the latter being the most sustainable way to consume the entheogen. It belongs to a class of chemical compounds called <a href="https://psychedelicstoday.com/2018/01/05/psychedelic-tryptamine-chemistry/">tryptamines</a>, which include psilocybin and DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine).</p>
<p>In the United States, the Colorado River toad is one of the most common and controversial sources of 5-MeO-DMT. Its native habitat runs along the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. But, the oldest known uses of 5-MeO-DMT come from South America. The chemical is a natural constituent in <em>Anadenanthera peregrina </em>seeds, which are used to make entheogenic Yopo snuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5-MeO-DMT produces an intense but short psychedelic experience. A full dose 5-MeO-DMT trip lasts between 30 and 90 minutes at most, and the majority are even significantly shorter than that. However, while the time on the clock may tick away quickly for those on the outside world, it certainly doesn’t for those in the middle of the psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>During a 5-MeO-DMT trip, it’s not uncommon for consumers to feel like they’ve transcended time. A 5-MeO-DMT trip is strong enough to take participants out of normal consciousness, into a state of temporary unconsciousness, with <a title="" target="_blank" href="https://doubleblindmag.com/ego-death/">ego death</a> making room for therapeutic exploration of the subconscious or an encounter with the divine. For this reason, a <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/trip-sit-lsd-psilocybin/">trip sitter</a> plays an important role in monitoring the participant while they’re on their journey.</p>
<h3 id="h-5-meo-dmt-average-dosage"><span id="5-MeO-DMT_Average_Dosage">5-MeO-DMT Average Dosage</span></h3>
<p>The average dosage of 5-MeO-DMT is small compared to many other psychedelics. Researchers report that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6292276/#:~:text=5%2DMeO%2DDMT%20appears%20to,with%20consumption)%2C%20which%20requires%20further">five to seven milligrams</a> are enough to occasion a moderate to strong experience. Those using toad secretion rather than synthetic 5-MeO-DMT often <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidcarpenter/2020/02/02/5-meo-dmt-the-20-minute-psychoactive-toad-experience-thats-transforming-lives/#398c2d2338a1">take doses of up to 50 milligrams</a>. It’s risky, however, for new consumers to start with such a dose, which may be overwhelming and more likely to cause negative reactions.</p>
<h3 id="h-how-do-you-take-5-meo-dmt"><span id="How_Do_You_Take_5-MeO-DMT">How Do You Take 5-MeO-DMT?</span></h3>
<p>5-MeO-DMT is most often inhaled through a vaporization device. Both synthesized 5-MeO-DMT and powdered toad venom comes in a crystallized or viscous form, and they’re often smoked using a high-heat pipe or rig. The active effects kick in within a mere couple seconds after inhalation, causing consumers to lose their sense of motor control and retreat inward into the depths of their consciousness.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h-5-meo-dmt-vs-dmt"><span id="5-MeO-DMT_vs_DMT">5-MeO-DMT <em>vs</em>. DMT</span></h2>
<p>Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is the active chemical component in <a title="" target="_blank" href="https://doubleblindmag.com/what-is-ayahuasca-iowaska/">ayahuasca</a>, famously dubbed “the spirit molecule.” It’s what thousands of tourists seek out during psychedelic pilgrimages to Latin America every year. DMT can also be smoked on its own, occasioning a more rapid, intense trip than the hours-long ayahuasca experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-5-meo-dmt-is-different"><span id="5-MeO-DMT_is_Different">5-MeO-DMT is Different</span></h3>

<p>It’s a derivative of DMT, meaning that they are related compounds. But, the two can produce different experiential and physiological effects. 5-MeO is often considered to be stronger than DMT, and consumers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/5MeODMT/comments/esb3jm/first_time_dmt_vs_5_meo_dmt/ff8wr6a/">often report</a> that it inspires a potent transcendent experience—devoid of visuals—rather than a highly visual experience, such as what DMT is known for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-the-god-molecule-and-mystical-experiences"><span id="The_God_Molecule_and_Mystical_Experiences">The “God Molecule” and Mystical Experiences</span></h2>
<p>5-MeO-DMT is called “the God Molecule” for a simple and yet astounding reason: It can make one feel as if they are speaking to, connected with, or becoming one with the divine. Like many other psychedelics, 5-MeO-DMT is an <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/what-does-entheogen-actually-mean/">entheogen</a>. An <em>entheogen</em> is a chemical compound that can trigger <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/rick-strassman-dmt-mystical-state/">mystical experiences</a>—feelings of intense spirituality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you need not be religious or spiritual to have an entheogenic experience with 5-MeO-DMT (or any psychedelic for that matter). Every person’s individual experience is unique, and “God” is merely one word to describe the <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/why-feeling-connected-is-good-for-your-health/">connection</a> that the drug seems to make possible. Instead of “God,” others may prefer terms like Brahman, Nirvana, Gaia, Nature, Universal Consciousness, Higher Power, or none at all. Whatever term they use, each person’s experience is ultimately different, and the meaning and interpretation of that experience is up to the individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that spirituality can be chemically triggered is one that many may find uncomfortable. But, as scientists probe into the mysterious world of psychedelics, many studies are finding exactly that: Psychedelics can inspire intense mystical experiences, similar to spontaneous religious epiphanies and spiritual revelations. Like religious or spiritual epiphanies, these chemically-induced experiences can be life-changing—and often correlate with the magnitude of healing the subject may experience for whatever indication they are aiming to treat with the psychedelic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Read: <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/toad-venom-vs-synthetic-5-meo-dmt/">Is it Worth Kidnapping Toads to Extract their Psychedelic Venom—When You Could Make it In a Lab?</a></em></strong></p>

<p>Indeed, some of the core tenants of a mystical experience include a deep-rooted feeling of unity and interconnectedness with the world around you, as well as profound feelings of joy, transcendence of time and space, and feelings of importance beyond the scope of the self. Psychedelic mystical experiences can be particularly profound because they can inspire a sense that this interconnectedness <em>is</em> reality, that this experience <em>is</em> the natural state of the world—the experience can have an inherent truth that extends beyond what words can describe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2011, researchers used psilocybin to<a href="https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC3537171&amp;blobtype=pdf"> test the long-term impact of psychedelic therapy on personality changes in adults</a>; psilocybin is the active constituent in magic mushrooms (sometimes simply called <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/how-to-take-shrooms-shroom-dosage-shroom-effects/">shrooms</a>). In general, personality is considered relatively set after adults reach the age of 30. But, in this particular study, researchers found that psilocybin could inspire “lasting personality changes” for over a year after treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And these changes were positive. After high-dose psilocybin therapy, participants who achieved a “mystical experience”—defined by specific criteria put forth by psychedelic scientists—left the study with higher marks of openness than they had upon arrival. “Openness” consists of a collection of personality traits, that includes a willingness to try new experiences, tolerance of others’ viewpoints, the appreciation of aesthetic qualities, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Read: <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/rick-strassman-dmt-mystical-state/">Rick Strassman on DMT and the Mystical State</a></em></strong></p>

<p>Other studies found that psychedelic experiences have reduced depression and anxiety, aided in trauma therapy for post-traumatic stress, and even had positive impacts in reducing alcoholic addictions and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. But, the majority of these studies were performed on more common psychedelics, like psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and ketamine.</p>
<p>Now, researchers are testing the ability of 5-MeO-DMT to occasion similar results—and they’ve had small successes thus far. Recently, scientists proved that the toad molecule indeed can<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6292276/"> inspire mystical experiences</a>, and may even hold potential as a more manageable therapy tool than psilocybin and LSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, not every person will have such an awe-inspiring interaction with the drug. It’s even possible to have a challenging experience—one that’s uncomfortable, traumatizing, and even unsafe. Unlike your average medicine, there is no regulation nor substantive clinical research that provide guidance about how to use 5-MeO-DMT, while scientists also have not extensively looked into whether or not certain people may face considerable physical and mental health risks when trying the compound.</p>

<p>In recent years, 5-MeO-DMT has garnered some attention among the scientific community. The chemical compound is particularly intriguing to those interested in psychedelic therapy. The 5-MeO-DMT experience can inspire profound experiences, but in a very short time-span—less than half an hour! By comparison, a psilocybin or LSD experience can last upward of six hours. But research on the psychoactive is only just beginning. Nevertheless, the following is a brief summary of what researchers have discovered thus far:</p>
<h3 id="h-5-meo-dmt-and-alcoholism"><span id="5-MeO-DMT_and_Alcoholism">5-MeO-DMT and Alcoholism&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>In 2018, researchers with the Crossroads Treatment Center in Tijuana, Mexico <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612318300931">presented a case study for the combined use of ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT</a> in the treatment of alcoholism. In their case study, a 42-year-old man was able to remain sober for one month after treatment, returning to mild alcohol use two months after treatment. The patient did report reduced cravings and desire to drink alcohol following the treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-5-meo-dmt-and-depression-and-anxiety"><span id="5-MeO-DMT_and_Depression_and_Anxiety">5-MeO-DMT and Depression and Anxiety&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>In March of 2019, researchers from John Hopkins University<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/fast-acting-psychedelic-associated-with-improvements-in-depressionanxiety"> surveyed 362 adults who used 5-MeO-DMT</a>. They found that 80 percent of participants reported improvements in depression and anxiety after use.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-5-meo-dmt-and-mindfulness"><span id="5-MeO-DMT_and_Mindfulness">5-MeO-DMT and Mindfulness</span></h3>
<p>In a 2019 study published in the journal <em>Psychopharmacology</em>, researchers reported that a single dose of 5-MeO-DMT <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-019-05236-w">increased feelings of mindfulness</a>, satisfaction with life, and decreased feelings of anxiety and depression. These positive effects were still noticeable four weeks after treatment. The 5-MeO-DMT was administered to 42 participants in a naturalistic and community-oriented setting.</p>

Photo by Joey Csunyo / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>Joey Csunyo / Unsplash</figcaption></figure></div><p>Yesterday, I wrote that <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms">Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code threatened to splinter the internet</a>. On Wednesday morning, the splintering arrived: Google cut a deal with News Corp. that will ensure its services continue to be provided in Australia, and Facebook walked away from the bargaining table and began preventing people from sharing news links from Australian publishers around the world. </p><p>I think Facebook basically did the right thing, and Google basically did the wrong thing, even though Google had a much tougher call to make. Today, let’s talk about why the tech giants made the decisions that they did, why Australia’s shakedown is rotten, and what’s likely to happen next. (If you didn’t <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms">read my piece on the subject yesterday</a>, it offers a lot of useful context for what follows. I’ve made it free for all subscribers to read.)</p><p>In development for three years, the bargaining code is intended to give Australia’s heavily concentrated media industry more leverage as publishers seek direct payment from Google and Facebook for the right to display links to their work. It does this by forcing the platforms into binding arbitration with publishers who bring cases, and puts the decision for how much the platform has to pay the publishers into the hands of the arbiter. Each side throws out a number, and the arbiter picks the one they think is most fair. </p><p>(The arbiter does <em>not</em> pick a number in between, by the way; I got that wrong yesterday and have corrected the post.)</p><p>By design, the arbitration process favors the publisher. Also by design, it encourages platforms to avoid the process altogether by signing one-off deals with individual publishers in hopes that they can get better terms that way. </p><p><strong>I. Google</strong></p><p>Over the past few days, Google has been signing deals with the biggest publishers in Australia for exactly this reason. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-australia-news-technology-seven-west-media-2021-2#:~:text=Google%20signed%20up%20a%20major,force%20payments%20to%20media%20outlets.">Seven West Media got a deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/nine-agrees-to-join-google-news-showcase-in-australia-for-reported-30m-a-year#:~:text=Australia's%20biggest%20locally%2Downed%20media,laws%20being%20debated%20in%20parliament.">Nine Entertainment got a deal</a>, and on Wednesday, one of the country’s biggest conglomerates — Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. —&nbsp;got its deal. In exchange for an undisclosed sum, Google will feature News Corp. articles in its News Showcase product in Australia and beyond.</p><p>“Among the News Corp publications joining Google News Showcase will be the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Barron’s</em>, <em>MarketWatch</em>, and the <em>New York Post</em>; in the UK: the<em> Times</em> and the <em>Sunday Times</em>; and the <em>Sun</em>; and in Australia a range of news platforms, including the <em>Australian</em>, news.com.au, Sky News, and multiple metropolitan and local titles,” the company told me in a statement.</p><p>As announced, the deals pertain to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/">Google News Showcase</a>, a tab within Google News that contains licensed content from official partners. But the people I’ve spoken with are operating under the assumption that if there’s a deal between Google and a big publisher in Australia, that publisher either can’t or won’t be dragged to arbitration for showing links and snippets of text in search results.</p><p>Search, of course, is what Google cares about the most, and explains why the company caved. Removing links to news&nbsp;stories from Google would break the search engine in Australia, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/11/endorsement-australias-proposal-technology-news/">opening it up to rivals</a>. And so the company signed a bunch of deals under duress. </p><p>(It’s worth mentioning that any Australian publisher aggrieved by an unfair exchange of value with Google here could opt out of search results&nbsp;at any time by adding one line of HTML to their website. But almost none of them do, because traffic from Google drives significant advertising and subscription revenue to them.)</p><p>With its moves today, Google has now invited every other country to pursue a similar protection racket. Parliament members in Canada and the European Union have already endorsed measures similar to Australia’s. And a basic tenet of the open web — that hyperlinks can be freely displayed on any website —&nbsp;just took a body blow.</p><p>I’d feel better about this if publishers said a single word about how much of their new Google revenue that they planned to spend on journalists’ salaries, or news gathering. </p><p>They didn’t, though, and why would they? Australia’s bargaining code doesn’t say one word about requiring that any of this money be spent on journalism, either.  </p><p><strong>II.</strong> <strong>Facebook</strong></p><p>Unlike Google, Facebook’s core service doesn’t rely heavily on news articles. The company estimates that only about 4 percent of posts on the network are works of journalism. It is not all that hard to imagine opening up Facebook and scrolling for a few minutes, never to see a link to a news article at all —&nbsp;and in fact, millions of people do this every day.</p><p>And so it is perhaps less surprising that when Google blinked at Australia’s demand, Facebook walked away. Here’s William Easton, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">Facebook’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand</a>:</p><blockquote><p>While the government has made some changes, the proposed law fundamentally&nbsp;<a href="https://australia.fb.com/post/our-response-to-australias-proposed-news-media-laws/">fails to understand</a>&nbsp;how our services work.</p><p>Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed.</p></blockquote><p>And just like that, news articles originating in Australia disappeared from Facebook.</p><p>Easton says that in the past year, Facebook sent more than 5 billion clicks to Australian publishers, whose value he estimated at AU$ 407 million. If the current situation holds, Facebook will send those same publishers zero clicks —&nbsp;a move that, I imagine, may force publishers to recalibrate in their minds the relative value that Facebook and publishers provide one another.</p><p>Of course, many critics were apoplectic that Facebook had taken this move, calling it <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1362135211606220800?s=20">a vile act of censorship</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1362172282102304769">unchecked greed</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/evelyndouek/status/1362171044136710144">destruction of the public sphere</a>. </p><p>Certainly the execution of the ban left something to be desired. </p><p>Rather than building a blacklist of news sites to restrict, Facebook tried using its machine learning systems to identify news publishers, and the systems went <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-18/bom-health-authorities-betoota-caught-in-facebook-news-ban/13166394?section=technology">predictably haywire</a>. There were reports that government and emergency pages, nonprofit groups, and the Bureau of Meteorology <a href="https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1362160410984476672?s=21">could no longer share</a>. Given how long the possibility of restricting links has loomed, you’d think Facebook would have better prepared for it to arrive.</p><p>And while I don’t want to make light of these mistakes, to the extent that they teach Facebook’s user base to seek their news elsewhere, they can serve a noble purpose. I don’t know a single journalist who feels comfortable with social networks being anyone’s primary source of news, particularly after years of daily reporting on the misinformation and conspiracy theories that so often thrive on them. And so it is more than a little strange to see so many people insisting that Facebook is obligated to share publishers’ content, on whatever terms those publishers set.</p><p>Some, <a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1362132040544628736?s=20">like OneZero’s Will Oremus</a>, have noted that removing high-quality news sources from Facebook will likely mean a boost for lower-quality blog posts, memes, and other junk. That seems fair, and I do think it bears watching. But what if, in the meantime, Australians simply … visit websites? Subscribe to newsletters? Read … books? I realize I sound hopelessly naive here. But if this is the beginning of more people coming to understand the value in visiting trusted news sources directly, I think we’d all be better off. Publishers included!</p><p>In reality, though, I suspect the great Australian news outage of 2021 will be short lived. Australia’s treasurer, a leading figure in the negotiations, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshfrydenberg/status/1362144150712315905?s=21">said he spoke with Mark Zuckerberg today</a>, and that negotiations continue. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html">Fun fact from the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html">New York Times</a></em>: Australia’s treasurer was also “<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/ryan-stokes-society-wedding-a-sizzler-20161202-gt30re.html" title="">the best man at the wedding of Ryan Stokes</a>, who is a son of Kerry Stokes, the billionaire owner of Seven West Media, one of the companies that have reached a deal with Google.”)</p><p>“We will continue to engage with the government on amendments to the law, with the aim of achieving a stable, fair path for both Facebook and publishers,” Facebook told me today when I asked for an update.</p><p>In the meantime, though, I’m glad Facebook called publishers’ bluff. </p><p><strong>III. What’s next</strong></p><p>I wish Australia would take Facebook’s rejection as a sign it should rethink its approach to media regulation entirely. It could just tax companies based on their revenues, for example. It could earmark those revenues to support journalism — nonprofit public media, even, <a href="http://www.orangemedianetwork.com/blog/screengaze/the-importance-of-public-broadcasting/article_dda75496-e27e-11e6-a558-2f6b46140340.html">which has consistently been shown to have powerful civic benefits</a>. Or it could pursue a bargaining code that requires big media conglomerates to create and support <em>jobs</em> in journalism, rather than simply accept tens of millions of dollars and spend them however they like — or just return it to shareholders.</p><p>In reality, though, none of that seems likely to happen. Google’s capitulation means that Australian crony capitalism is now likely to be exported worldwide. Legacy media outlets will become richer —&nbsp;and also more dependent on the tech giants that they excoriate daily for having too much power over them. All the while, the media industry will continue to consolidate, and it will be harder to get or keep a job in journalism.</p><p>A bargaining code that truly sought to level the playing field between the platforms and the public would take these realities into account. There is still time to amend it before Parliament takes a vote, and here’s hoping that lawmakers do — both&nbsp;in Australia and beyond it.</p><h3>Message received</h3><p>Y’all really, really prefer the standard linking format. So we’re back to normal today — though I still feel like I could make these feel more valuable somehow; maybe just arranging them differently. I’ll keep you posted, but thanks to everyone who wrote in yesterday with feedback!</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies.

<p>BY JENNIFER CABRERA</p>



<p>According to data released today by Florida Governor Ron DeSantisâ€™ office, Florida is outperforming lockdown states like California and New York on all metrics. Florida has lower per-capita mortality, higher availability of in-person education, and a lower unemployment rate.</p>



<p><strong>Excess deaths</strong></p>



<ul><li>Compared to Florida, 34 states had a higher rate of all-cause mortality from 2019 to 2020, per capita. Higher-than-average increases indicate that states probably had extra deaths resulting from lockdown policies, not just from COVID-19.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="851" height="479" src="https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185337.679.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185337.679.jpg 851w, https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185337.679-300x169.jpg 300w, https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185337.679-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px"></figure>



<ul><li>Compared to Florida, 38 other states rank higher for per-capita COVID-19 mortality among seniors 65 and older.</li></ul>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="851" height="479" src="https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185401.219.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185401.219.jpg 851w, https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185401.219-300x169.jpg 300w, https://rationalground.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2021-02-16T185401.219-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px"></figure>



<p><strong>Florida has fewer pediatric COVID-19 cases while having the highest rate of in-person instruction offered.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Schools have been open in Florida, and Florida still has fewer COVID-19 cases among kids when compared to other large states on a per capita basis. (New York is not included because they donâ€™t make pediatric cases publicly available).</li></ul>

<ul><li>Governor DeSantis acted early in the pandemic to protect the stateâ€™s most vulnerable, and his actions saved lives:<ul><li>Governor DeSantis established 23 COVID-19 dedicated nursing facilities across the state to prevent spread within long-term care facilities, help with hospital decompression, and protect long-term care patients. The Governor also required hospitals to test all individuals discharged to long-term care facilities and required these facilities to transfer COVID-19 positive residents if the facility was not equipped for appropriate care.</li><li>Governor DeSantis issued an executive order putting Seniors First and prioritizing seniors 65 and older to receive the vaccine. To date, 40% of Floridaâ€™s nearly 4.5 million senior population have received a vaccine.</li><li>Governor DeSantis deployed Florida National Guard and Florida Department of Health Strike Teams to nursing homes and assisted living facilities for testing throughout the pandemic, and now for vaccine distribution.</li><li>Governor DeSantis launched a pilot program for homebound seniors, including Holocaust survivors, WWII and Korean War veterans, and anti-communist Bay of Pigs veterans, to prioritize and protect our Greatest Generation.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Floridaâ€™s economic recovery is leading the nation.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Florida leads the nationâ€™s most populous states in unemployment rate for December 2020, and Florida was well below the national average.</li></ul>

Many product people are dealing with career uncertainty — and not just the “will my company make it through the pandemic?” variety. Without the usual distractions of life available, things that were easily overlooked are now front and center.</p><p>And what are many of these product people realizing without the distractions of normal life?</p><p><strong>They’re set up to fail.</strong></p><p>Their work environment and culture is not set up to create strong products. It is distinctly <em>not</em> set up to empower the collaboration of product, design, and engineering to build things that matter.</p><p>This has led many to realize it’s time for a job change.</p><p>As product people, we want to work in a product-led company. A place that truly values the craft and contribution of product, and that empowers individuals and teams to work to their highest potential. A place that is built around creating amazing products that truly make life better for the people they’re trying to serve.</p><p>We all know it’s possible. It’s what the best product companies are doing. Yet despite many attempts tried, there are many frustrated PMs that can’t seem to get their work environment to change.</p><p>This is because, frankly, they joined the wrong company in the first place.</p><p>They took a role where good product work occurs in spite of the dominant practices and culture, not because of them.</p><p>Jobs like this waste precious years of your career. I’ve made this mistake too, and it hurts. I hope this article helps you avoid it in the future.</p><p>It’s actually really hard to know how strong of a product culture and environment that a team has prior to living in it. Even within the FAANG companies, every team and manager is different and you need to find out the truth.</p><p>After reading this, you should have a go-to set of questions to ask the next companies you interview. These will help you suss out the reality of how the company operates before you commit to an offer. I’m writing this for product managers, but it’s equally relevant to design and engineering.</p><p>So, what <em>can</em> you do to make sure that your next company is <em>actually</em> a good place to be a product person?</p><p>The key to solving this is to <em>interview companies the same way we interview users and customers</em>.</p><p>Think of this as “The Mom Test,” applied to product job interviews.</p><h2 id="interviewing-companies-like-users-customers">Interviewing companies like users/customers<a href="#interviewing-companies-like-users-customers"></a></h2><h3 id="why-you-need-to-do-this">Why you need to do this<a href="#why-you-need-to-do-this"></a></h3><p>One of the most common complaints in the job search process is “this place isn’t what I thought it would be.”</p><p>People join a company full of vigor and excitement, and within a few months they are bored, going through the motions, and fantasizing yet again about being somewhere that “gets product.”</p><p>It doesn’t have to be this way.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://andrewskotzko.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/t3pawlU7qxNyGBkCZMWQLQxfOUct30uDWgZqusxwAHau6pIJ6hAh530ETyv3vLRSapIHNHHSBevu-zemY4za4V5cY7ONyvP97DtHfMILgezcPqd8eOngk1mPY7nD9smhqwVqNA64.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="308" srcset="https://andrewskotzko.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/t3pawlU7qxNyGBkCZMWQLQxfOUct30uDWgZqusxwAHau6pIJ6hAh530ETyv3vLRSapIHNHHSBevu-zemY4za4V5cY7ONyvP97DtHfMILgezcPqd8eOngk1mPY7nD9smhqwVqNA64.jpg 640w, https://andrewskotzko.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/t3pawlU7qxNyGBkCZMWQLQxfOUct30uDWgZqusxwAHau6pIJ6hAh530ETyv3vLRSapIHNHHSBevu-zemY4za4V5cY7ONyvP97DtHfMILgezcPqd8eOngk1mPY7nD9smhqwVqNA64-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></figure></div><p>As PMs, we invest so much getting ready for those damn product interviews that we often forget: <strong>we need to interview the company just as hard as they’re interviewing us.</strong></p><p>This is called “reverse interviewing.” As product people, we already know how to do this.</p><p>We know how to interview customers and users. We know to ask questions to account for bias and speculation, surface actual behavior, and understand how decisions are really made.</p><p>When applying for a job, we need to apply those same skills to interview our interviewers.</p><p>As Marty Cagan said to me in <a href="https://pod.fo/e/af7e6">our podcast conversation</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>From your point of view, your job is to learn as much as possible about how that company really works, and especially how that manager would be like to work for.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let’s see how to do just that.</p><h3 id="principles-for-interviewing">Principles for interviewing<a href="#principles-for-interviewing"></a></h3><p>Two excellent resources on interviewing users—which you really should read if you haven’t—are <a href="https://www.producttalk.org/2016/03/customer-interview-questions/">this post by Teresa Torres</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2MXuN2D">The Mom Test</a>.</p><p>I distill their points into these two overarching principles for interviewing:</p><ol><li>Separate your research questions and interview questions</li><li>Ask questions that uncover actual past behavior, rather than speculative or aspirational future behavior</li></ol><h3 id="separate-research-questions-from-interview-questions">Separate research questions from interview questions<a href="#separate-research-questions-from-interview-questions"></a></h3><p>The user research community has learned that we often can’t directly ask our questions and get reliable answers.</p><p>The way around this is to map our research questions to interview questions.</p><p>Research questions are what we really want to know. Interview questions are what we actually ask to get the interviewee telling stories that show their behavior. (This is a concept I learned from Teresa Torres in her <a href="https://learn.producttalk.org/p/continuous-interviewing">excellent interviewing course</a>.)</p><p>For example, imagine you work at Spotify and your team is assigned to work on reducing the churn rate.</p><p>Let’s say you’ve learned that users who play a given playlist consistently at the start of their workday are retained ~20% longer than those who don’t. Your research questions might be:</p><ul><li>Why are people using the same playlist every day?</li><li>What are people looking for in such a playlist? How do they choose playlists?</li><li>When, where, and how do people find these playlists?</li><li>What is unique about playlists that have high retention rates?</li><li>Are users more likely to exhibit the desired behavior with a playlist they follow, or one they create?</li></ul><p>Some interview questions to get stories containing this information could be:</p><ul><li>Tell me about your morning playlist? How did you first find it?</li><li>Walk me through your day. Start with the moment you woke up.</li><li>Tell me about how you start your workday</li><li>Tell me about the last playlist you discovered that you really liked</li><li>Tell me about the last playlist you made yourself</li></ul><p>Each of these prompts a story about actual behavior, and we can then ask more questions to go deeper. A well-extracted story can often answer multiple research questions at once.</p><p>Now let’s talk about how to apply this to finding a great product environment to work in.</p><h3 id="the-droids-were-looking-for">The droids we’re looking for <a href="#the-droids-were-looking-for"></a></h3><p>What we’re seeking in our job search: empowered product teams.</p><p>Empowered product teams—as opposed to delivery or feature teams—only exist in environments with strong product leadership.</p><p>Empowered product teams:</p><ol id="block-31aad864-d497-461b-8f72-65138efd7926"><li>are small, cross-functional, and durable</li><li>address product risks early with collaborative product discovery, and regularly “kill their darlings” en route to ideas that work</li><li>are accountable to delivering results rather than output</li></ol><p>These teams exist in product orgs with an environment that has:</p><ol id="block-31aad864-d497-461b-8f72-65138efd7926"><li>a focused and insight-rich product strategy</li><li>regular, ongoing cadence of lightweight research directly with their user/customer, rather than handing this off to a research group</li><li>people connected to the product vision in a visceral, energetic way</li><li>managers that are proactively and regularly coaching and developing team members</li><li>an equal partnership with the rest of the business</li></ol><p>Teams like this are great places to be a product person. These are where magical career experiences and products come from. And they are made up of ordinary, hard-working, sincere people just like you.</p><p>(To go deep on the idea of empowered teams, read Marty Cagan’s latest book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3cFAo8G">EMPOWERED</a>, and listen to the <a href="https://pod.fo/e/af7e6">deep dive conversation I had with him about the ideas in the book</a>.)</p><p>Our research question is: “is this a place that empowers product people/teams?”</p><p>Now that we know what we’re looking for, how do we assess a given job opportunity?</p><p>This is where our interview questions come in.</p><h2 id="reverse-interview-questions">Reverse interview questions<a href="#reverse-interview-questions"></a></h2><p>Since every company we talk to will <em>say</em> they’re a good product company, we need to dig deeper. Just as with users, we can’t take them at their word. We need evidence from real behavior.</p><p>Based on my own career, research, listener questions and podcast interviews with product people, here are my top reverse interview questions (click to jump to the section for the given question):</p><ol><li><a href="#1-what-were-the-last-few-things-your-team-has-built-and-shipped-and-how-did-you-decide-to-do-those">What were the last few things your team has built and shipped, and how did you decide to do those?</a></li><li><a href="#2-whens-the-last-time-you-talked-with-your-customers-users-how-often-have-you-done-that-in-the-last-month">When’s the last time you talked with your customers?

    <p>In February 2021, George Hotz (geohot) et al. <a href="https://github.com/cheapETH/go-ethereum/tree/cheapeth">forked the Ethereum chain</a> to form <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cheapeth.org/">cheapETH</a>. A project intended to provide a stable, affordable
      testnet for the
      Ethereum ecosystem, with cross-chain communication functionality. The founders of the devETH project participated
      in this community, spending time and resources building infrastructure surrounding the project.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, days after the project was started, a member of the cheapETH community discovered and pointed out
      <a href="https://github.com/cheapETH/go-ethereum/commit/412c38434d8d88840452c090e738a672139a73d4#diff-67b4f96b9bd587cc5f508f38eb63f372fa31f339bf66fedcb188f78774318201R88">patch</a>
      in the cheapETH fork of go-ethereum, that grants 25,000,000 cheapETH tokens to the developers associated with the
      project. According to the <a href="https://github.com/cheapETH/cheapeth-website/blob/442027739ee61444c711346c7e3b2a06aecd94aa/index.html#L93">cheapETH
        website</a>, that would theoretically amount to 25,000 Ethereum as per the pegged 1/1000 ratio described by the
      cheapETH developers. This single transaction has <b>theoretical</b> market value of $46 million USD at the time of
      writing. (Feb 18th)
    </p>
    <p>Following this revelation on the cheapETH Discord server, a number of community members expressed their concern
      regarding this seemingly gratuitous developer fund, and the details surrounding its implementation. Instead of
      addressing these issues, the cheapETH staff appointed in the Discord community resorted to deleting messages and
      banning members of the community who were posing unwanted questions about the financial motivations of the
      cheapETH project.</p>
    <p>The devETH project authors do not intend to make any assumptions/accusations as to the financial
      dealings/motivations of the cheapETH developers - They are free to do whatever they wish with their project.
      However, prompted by the drastic response in the Discord community, and a suggestion by <a href="https://github.com/cheapETH/go-ethereum/pull/2#issuecomment-779544030">George Hotz</a>, a group of
      cheapETH community members decided to launch the devETH project as a direct fork of the cheapETH project.</p>
    <p>We intend to continue innovating on the vision of the cheapETH project, and wish all the best to the cheapETH
      team on their endeavour.</p>
    <p>The devETH team invites anyone interested in our take on the cheapETH vision to participate in our <a href="https://discord.gg/xFmCcaEjPK">Discord server</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Let me preface this with an explanation. Over the last few days I read online people saying that Texas' power outages had been caused by Texas being on its own grid… deregulation… Not following national standards…  had Texas been connected to the Eastern Interconnection or the Western Interconnection none of this would have happened. But not one post shows any evidence or requirements that backed up these claims. So, I went looking for proof and instead of finding requirements, I found a nationwide problem with winterization. As an aside I am not an expert in the grid or electricity, I am a software developer, and this is my best interpretation of the requirements I could find.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with how the electrical grid works in the US. The grid is made up of 3 interconnections: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Texas Interconnect. Each of these interconnections operate in (near) isolation with their own frequency, voltage, and phase. There are several high voltage DC interconnects (HVDC or DC-DC) between them. In each of these interconnections there is at least one grid operators, for example ERCOT in Texas. These grid operators manage the generation and load of their interconnection, acting as almost as an electric clearing house. They are also responsible for keeping voltage and frequency within range and directing distributors (like ONCOR in north Texas) to shed load during Electrical Emergency Alerts (EEA). An important thing to note for later, from the best I can tell the different grid operators in the Eastern Interconnect share power in a “non-firm, as-available basis”.</p>
<p>What happened in Texas, starting 12:30 AM February 15. The long and short of it is an estimated 34GW of generation went offline in about 2 hours[1]. Looking at ERCOT’s tweets [2,3,4], generation was starting to have an issue at 00:17:45 and some load needed to be shed so ERCOT issued the first EEA (EEA1). In the February EEA tools document[5] EEA1 can open up around 1.6GW of “peeker” generation and importation from the Eastern and Western Interconnections. But by 1:12:06 that wasn’t enough and additional load had to be shed.  A second EEA was issued (EEA2) shedding another 1.6GW. But just a few minutes later the house came crashing down and at 1:25:40 the third EEA (EEA3) was issued. In addition to starting rolling blackouts to shed most of the load it also allowed for other actions to free .1-.2GW of load.</p>
<p>The 34GW of generation lost was from every fuel source used. Most of it was frozen-off natural gas (gas) wells, some of it was frozen wind turbines, solar panels that had snow on them and even a nuclear plant had to go offline due to issues with feedwater pressure sensing issues related to the cold.
What do the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards say about protecting any of these sources? Not much.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the least complex, wind turbines. On September 12, 2012 NERC published a Lesson Learned document in regards to Texas’s issues with some of the wind farms freezing in extreme winter weather[6]. According to the document the event that was predicted over a week beforehand brought 4 days of low temperature, high winds and wind chills, ice and snow that limited the generation facility to just 25% of capacity. The facility did have a SOP for icing conditions that was implemented. However, the facility never defined it’s minimum operating temperature. When lightning knocked out some of the sensing equipment, the turbines had to be stop for safety. The repair crews couldn’t immediately get to the turbines and they had to sit, this gave the oil a chance to cool and partly freeze. When the turbines were returned to service, they tripped back off due to high oil pressure. Eventually after working with the manufacturer they were able to safely heat the oil and restart the turbines. One of the big lessons from this was to install cold weather packs for wind turbines and watch the oil temperature. You’d think that would solve future outage, but no, in 2019 in the midwestwind turbines failed due to exceptionally low temperatures, around -21. Again the cold weather package hadn’t been installed and was one of the root causes of the failure[7].</p>
<p>The nuclear plant’s sensing problems had happened before too. Although it wasn’t a nuclear plant, there are several documented cases on NERC’s website citing cold weather and sensor issues [8,9]. This repeated in Texas (2011) and in the south east (2018)[10].</p>
<p>Let’s discuss natural gas next. It appears that most of the issues in the problematic natural gas fired facilities was due to low gas supplies. In 2012 NERC warned of the interconnectivity of natural gas and electric[11]. Natural gas coming out of the ground has a naturally high water content. This water can freeze the extraction equipment during sub-freezing weather in improperly winterized wells creating what is know as a freeze-off. businesses, residential customers, and powerplants all run off the same supply, once wells start freezing off the supply dwindles for all. Natural gas companies prioritize residential customers as needed and will cut businesses and powerplants. This obviously creates issues in electrical generation.</p>
<p>In this latest case, much of the gas generation loss was due to under pressure conditions at the generation site. When generation sites detect this kind of fault, they are taken offline for safety. Not only is this what happened this year, but it has happened many, many times before</p>
<p>The most resent case I could find was 2018 in the south east[10]. Starting on January 18, 2018 a large area in the south east US experienced unusually cold weather. This caused 183 generation facilities to go offline or operate with greatly reduced output. At the peak there was nearly 30GW of production lost. This caused several grid operators to issue EEAs and begin rolling blackouts. In the “event area” 14% of the failures could be directly attributed to the cold weather. And another 30% could be indirectly linked to weather, including mechanical failures know to happen in cold weather and gas supply issues. NERC found that more than 33% of the failed powerplants didn’t have a winterization plan.</p>
<p>Why didn’t these plants have a winterization plan? Because it wasn’t required[10,12].</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be so bad if this wqs the first time it happened, it wasn’t even the second time it happened. In 2014 a polar vortex hit the US. bringing temperatures well below normal. During this event 55% of the outages were at gas power plants and in all 90GW of generation was lost[13].</p>
<p>The earliest report I could find was from the 2011 winter event in Texas[14]. A very strong cold front hit Texas (and other parts of the south central US) bringing temperatures below freezing for over 4 days and winds over 30 MPH. Leading up to the event, ERCOT and other grid operators in surrounding areas felt that there wouldn’t be a need for rolling blackouts. At the beginning of the event ERCOT had 3.1GW of reserve, nearly 1GW over the minimum required. However, over the next 2 days ERCOT lost nearly 30GW of production in 193 generation facilities. ERCOT was able to stabilize the grid with rolling blackouts and the other EEA methods[5]. Other grids suffered problems as well, EPE (El Paso) and SRP (Arizona) lost nearly 1.4GW due to cold weather. Another issue in ERCOT’s region was nearly 50% of the “black start” facilities were either down for scheduled maintenance or failed on startup. One of the main causes again was the loss of gas during this blackout period. 14.8 Bcf of natural gas production was lost due to freeze-offs, electrical outages (ironically) and customer curtailments. following the previous equivalent storm in 1989, the PUCT (Public Utility Commission of Texas) issued several recommendations and guidelines for winterization of power plants and gas wells. However, due to the infrequency of these storms the implementation lacked. With many of the same facilities that failed in 1989 also failed in 2011.  My guess is these same sites failed again in 2021. Interestingly the NERC found that it is quite possible that gas production in these unusually cold conditions may be impossible.</p>
<p>What has been done since 2011? Not a whole lot. A request for a new standard was issued to NERC in late 2012, however a few months later it was denied.[15] Also in 2012 NERC put out a set of guidelines for developing a plan for winter weather[16]. In 2017 NERC put out a special reliability report on the relationship between gas and electricity[17]. Finally, after the 2018 event NERC received another standard request that was approved[23], however it won’t be finalized until late 2021[18,19,20].</p>
<p>From what I can see, ERCOT has more restrictive rules in their Generator Winter Weatherization Workshop than NERC[21]. All generation stations must have plans for emergencies, address abnormal weather, critical failure points, weather design limits, alternative fuels and testing[21,22]. ERCOT reports that there were 80 spot checks done in the 2019/2020 season with 71 being gas plants and 6 being black start gas plants. 23 had to improve and would be reinspected in early 2021 the rest passed.</p>
<p>The issue of extreme cold weather and electrical outages is a national issue that needs to be addressed. However, after repeated failings it hasn’t really been addressed. Hopefully with the new NERC requirements and the Texas legislature in session progress can be made.</p>

            <p>Later-stage companies are more likely to allow employee stock sales, either through company-led transactions or by allowing employee-led transactions. Doing so allows them to provide long-time members of the team with an opportunity to de-risk by getting some liquidity. 

            </p><p>However, today, some companies like Pipe have begun making liquidity available for their employees as early as seed/Series A.</p>

            <p>Some companies don’t allow for employee sales of their stock. In some instances, these companies implement transfer restrictions that prevent private sales from occurring.</p>

          <h3>Stock option exercise lending</h3> 
          
          <p>One barrier to employee liquidity is exercising your stock options, which can be expensive and confusing. Some companies help by allowing employees to borrow cash to meet their option exercise and tax obligations. </p>

          <h3>Secondary brokerages</h3>
          
          <p>If your company allows for you to sell your stock, but doesn’t offer regular company-led liquidity, you may be able to sell it on a secondary marketplace or via a broker.</p>
          <h3>Secondary funds</h3>
          
          <p>Certain venture funds specialize in “special situations” like employee and/or founder liquidity at private companies, and actually prefer to buy stock in secondary markets.</p>
          <h3>Company liquidity platforms</h3>
          
          <p>If your company offers regular liquidity by way of tender offers, share buybacks, or auctions, you will likely know about it well in advance. If you’re not sure, you can ask your HR or finance team and they will let you know if your company allows for these types of transactions.</p>

  <div>
<p>Hot on the heels of Gleam v0.13 comes another release, <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.14.0">Gleam v0.14</a>!
As always, let’s take a look at some of the highlights.</p>

<h2 id="dialyzer--erlang-typespecs">Dialyzer &amp; Erlang typespecs</h2>

<p>Many dynamically typed BEAM languages support Erlang’s typespecs, type
annotations that can be analysed with the <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html">Dialyzer</a> tool. While
not as powerful or reliable as Gleam’s type system it can be a useful tool
for finding problems with your Erlang or Elixir code. Dialyzer doesn’t
require typespecs but it can work better if they are added to the code.</p>

<p>Starting with this release Gleam will generate typespecs for all functions
and Erlang type definitions for all declared types within a Gleam program,
giving you one extra tool to help you write robust and reliable code when
using Gleam alongside Elixir or Erlang.</p>

<p>For a quick example, here’s some code in Gleam:</p>

<p>No annotations are required at all in your Gleam code to get full typespec
coverage, Gleam’s compiler reuses the type information from its powerful type
inference algorithm to determine the correct typespecs.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://gitlab.com/greggreg">Greg</a> for this brilliant new feature!</p>

<h2 id="erlang-escripts">Erlang escripts</h2>

<p>Erlang projects are unusual in that typically instead of having a <code>main</code>
function as the entrypoint of your application you define a tree of actors to
come online and process items of work while your program is running.</p>

<p>This can be a powerful way to write long-lived services that make use of the
runtime’s fault tolerance features, but it does not lend itself well to
short-lived programs such as command line scripts. It can be confusing to
newcomers from other languages too.</p>

<p>For these short lived programs Erlang <a href="https://erlang.org/doc/man/escript.html">escripts</a> are typically used.
These are lightweight Erlang programs that have a <code>main</code> function as an entrypoint.</p>

<p>To make it easier to use these from Gleam the <code>gleam new</code> command now has an
escript template that can be used to create an escript project without any
further configuration required.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gleam new my_script <span>--template</span> escript
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A world class developer experience is a key goal of the Gleam project.
Further tooling improvements are right around the corner!</p>

<h2 id="night-mode">Night mode</h2>

<p>Gleam has the ability to render <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/">HTML documentation</a> 
for your code, ready to upload to Hexdocs.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tynanbe">Tynan Beatty</a> the documentation is
looking better than ever! There’s too many improvements to list but the big
one is they now have a night mode! If you’re a night owl like me I’m sure you
will enjoy the lower contrast dark tones when doing some late evening coding.</p>

<p><img src="https://gleam.run/images/news/gleam-v0.14-released/night-mode.png" alt="A screenshot of Gleam's rendered docs showing a beautiful dark theme"></p>

<h2 id="better-errors-again">Better errors, again</h2>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record Gleam’s error messages have been
improved yet again. Here’s an example of one of the improvements:</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/thing.gleam:115:18
    │
115 │ pub fn overlappedBy(compare, a, b) -&gt; Bool {
    │                  ^^ I was not expecting this.

Expected one of: "("
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/thing.gleam:115:18
    │
115 │ pub fn overlappedBy(compare, a, b) -&gt; Bool {
    │                  ^^ This is not a valid name.

Hint: Names start with a lowercase letter and contain a-z, 0-9, or _.
Try: overlapped_by
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/samontea">Samuel Mercier</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pd-andy">Andy
Thompson</a> for these.</p>

<h2 id="static-bit-string-validation">Static bit string validation</h2>

<p>Bit string syntax is a feature that Gleam inherits from Erlang. It provides a
way to declartively and concisely construct and manipulate raw bits of data
through literals and pattern matching.</p>

<p>With this Gleam release we apply further static analysis to bit string
literals and patterns used in Gleam programs to catch invalid or incorrect
code.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of one of the errors that may be reported:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /Users/a/parser_test/src/a.gleam:2:20
  │
2 │   &lt;&lt;1:size(1)-unit(0)&gt;&gt;
  │                    ^ This is not a valid BitString unit value.

Hint: unit must be an integer literal &gt;= 1 and &lt;= 256
See: https://gleam.run/book/tour/bit-strings
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://gitlab.com/greggreg">Greg</a> for this bit string safety net.</p>

<h2 id="docker-images">Docker images</h2>

<p>Up until now <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer">Peter Saxton</a> has been very kindly
building Gleam docker images for use in <a href="https://sendmemo.app/">Memo</a> and the
wider community.</p>

<p>With this release he has ported his build automation over to the Gleam repo
so we have automation creation of OCI/Docker images built and published
automatically with each release.</p>

<p>We are building these variants:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>gleam-erlang</code>: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on Ubuntu Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-erlang-slim</code>: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on slim Debian Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-erlang-alpine</code>: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on Alpine Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-elixir</code>: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on Ubuntu Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-elixir-slim</code>: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on slim Debian Linux</li>
  <li><code>gleam-elixir-alpine</code>: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on Alpine Linux</li>
</ul>

Viruses are the most numerous biological entities on the planet. Now researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) have identified over 140,000 viral species living in the human gut, more than half of which have never been seen before.

<br></p><p>The paper, published today in <i><a href="https://href.li/?https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.029">Cell</a></i>, contains an analysis of over 28,000 gut microbiome samples collected in different parts of the world. The number and diversity of the viruses the researchers found was surprisingly high, and the data opens up new research avenues for understanding how viruses living in the gut affect human health.</p><p>The human gut is an incredibly biodiverse environment. In addition to bacteria, hundreds of thousands of viruses called bacteriophages, which can infect bacteria, also live in the human gut.</p><p>It is known that imbalances in our gut microbiome can contribute to diseases and complex conditions such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease, allergies and obesity. But relatively little is known about the role our gut bacteria, and the bacteriophages that infect them, play in human health and disease.</p><p>Using a DNA-sequencing method called metagenomics*, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) explored and catalogued the biodiversity of the viral species found in 28,060 public human gut metagenomes and 2,898 bacterial isolate genomes cultured from the human gut.</p><p>The analysis identified over 140,000 viral species living in the human gut, more than half of which have never been seen before.</p><h2>“It’s important to remember that not all viruses are harmful, but represent an integral component of the gut ecosystem. For one thing, most of the viruses we found have DNA as their genetic material, which is different from the pathogens most people know, such as SARS-CoV-2 or Zika, which are RNA viruses. Secondly, these samples came mainly from healthy individuals who didn’t share any specific diseases. It’s fascinating to see how many unknown species live in our gut, and to try and unravel the link between them and human health.”<b><br></b></h2><p><b>Dr Alexandre Almeida, Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL-EBI and the Wellcome Sanger Institute</b><br></p><p>Among the tens of thousands of viruses discovered, a new highly prevalent clade – or group of viruses believed to have a common ancestor – was identified, which the authors refer to as the Gubaphage. This was found to be the second most prevalent virus clade in the human gut, after the crAssphage, which was discovered in 2014.</p><p>Both of these viruses seem to infect similar types of human gut bacteria, but without further research it’s very difficult to know the exact functions of the newly discovered Gubaphage.</p><h2>“An important aspect of our work was to ensure that the reconstructed viral genomes were of the highest quality. A stringent quality control pipeline coupled with a machine learning approach enabled us to mitigate contamination and obtain highly complete viral genomes. High-quality viral genomes pave the way to better understand what role viruses play in our gut microbiome, including the discovery of new treatments such as antimicrobials from bacteriophage origin.”<br></h2><p><b><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/camarillo-guerrero-luis-fernando/">Dr Luis F.

The results of the study form the basis of the Gut Phage Database (GPD), a highly curated database containing 142,809 non-redundant phage genomes that will be an invaluable resource for those studying bacteriophages and the role they play on regulating the health of both our gut bacteria and ourselves.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Recently, there’s been discussion about an accidental $900 million wire that Citibank sent out while Revlon was restructuring some of its debt. You can read the details <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back" target="_blank">here</a>, but in short, the payment escaped controls and was completed, and when the team realized their mistake they asked for their money back. But they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/citibank-just-got-a-500-million-lesson-in-the-importance-of-ui-design/" target="_blank">couldn’t</a> get it all back.<br></p><p>Although $900 million is an astonishing number, Citibank is not alone. In 2018 Deutsche Bank accidentally wired an exchange <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/investing/deutsche-bank-35-billion-mistake/index.html" target="_blank">$35 billion</a> — $5 billion more than the bank was worth at the time. The worst “fat-finger” mistake I know of happened in Tokyo in 2005, when a trader filed a share order worth <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/japan-traders-617-billion-fat-finger-nearmiss-rattles-tokyo-market" target="_blank">$617 billion</a> and sent it to the exchange.<br></p><p>These types of errors happen all the time, and they’re entirely the fault of software, not people.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Citibank case goes to the heart of why we started Modern Treasury.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In 2015, Sam and I started building a marketplace for individuals to invest in the renovation loans that LendingHome was making. Building a “fractional” marketplace <a href="#1">[1]</a> increases the number of transactions in a system. When it really started working, it exploded the number of payments we made — from hundreds to tens of thousands per month — and that’s when we started uncovering the many issues that we now call “payment operations.”<br></p><p>In spite of being the lifeblood of every business, there has been a dearth of modern software built for payment operations in the past half century. So I wanted to share a few of our near misses and provide a perspective on why we believe so passionately that payment operations deserves great software.&nbsp;</p><h4>Could Citi’s Mistake Have been Prevented?&nbsp;<br></h4><p>There are several levels.<br></p><p>Here’s a screenshot of the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/industries/financial-services/banking/flexcube-universal-banking/" target="_blank">Flexcube</a> product that the team at Citibank used for this transaction. The team wanted to pay out interest but not loan principal, but in order to do so the software required an internal “wash” account, and a process that involved checking three boxes (and no less: checking only one doesn’t trigger any alerts.) I think we can agree that this product is less than intuitive to use.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/602ec598b91eff48eb08f141_flexcube.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In addition to being simple to use, a payment ops product needs to be flexible. For this team, there is no API, so the workflow had been hard-coded years before. It was so out of date that the team had to have a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back" target="_blank">manual</a> to instruct how to work around it. The reason the high amount was being typed in at all was that this “software will only let you pay principal to some lenders if you pretend to pay it to every lender” (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back" target="_blank">source</a>). The workflow is so rigid it’s all or nothing.</p><p>Finally, controls. The Citibank team went through three levels of approvals over email. A good payment operations system should dynamically route payments to the right person or persons for release, but only if those users get the information they need to make an informed decision. Over email, that doesn’t happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Good people operating bad software will eventually make a mistake.&nbsp;<br>‍<br></p><h3>How Software Like This Gets Built</h3><h4>Act One: The Tech Team Wants to Talk to the Bank</h4><p>The first realization we had when we set out to solve this problem at LendingHome was that in order to make payments, you must do so through your bank. But banks do not have clean APIs. To compensate, we had to build a custom bank integration.&nbsp;</p><p>The US has a single system for wire transfers, the Fedwire system, and that is the common denominator across all banks. But each bank then operates its own “bank core” software on top of the Fedwire system, and that software maintains accounts and ledgers, records transactions, and so on. The bank therefore actually has a separate interface. So we now have two interfaces:&nbsp;</p><p>Customer -- Bank -- Fedwire</p><p>Building on these interfaces takes investment of time and resources, because bank cores are challenging to integrate with and understand. Some banks use <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/what-is-direct-transmission" target="_blank">Direct Transmission</a> over SFTP while others provide SOAP APIs. Timings <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#ach-timings" target="_blank">vary</a>. There are different, competing, data exchange formats for things like reporting on errors, and the configurations can vary from banks on identical cores.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When pressed for resources, teams cut corners. It’s hard to justify investing in wonderful design and robust systems for internal processes, so much of what’s out there is half-built, inflexible, and non-intuitive, and rarely gets any attention from the design team.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The result of poor software is workarounds. We had finance colleagues who had Excel wizard skills and a tolerance for manual process pain at which we marveled, but at some point even they would come down to the engineering floor and, in a desperate cry for help, ask us to “JUST COMPUTER IT!”<br></p><p>(We registered that domain a couple of years later. Check out <a href="http://www.justcomputerit.com/" target="_blank">www.justcomputerit.com</a> the next time you’re frustrated with a payment ops problem.)</p><h4>Act Two: It’s Not One Bank, It’s Many</h4><p>It’s not just a single bank integration problem. It’s many.<br></p><p>Most companies, once they become somewhat large, operate on more than one bank. So not only does the engineering team have to understand and integrate with one bank, they have to repeat that process for each subsequent bank from scratch, and as we have seen, that’s a scary proposition.<br></p><p>Now we have many integrations:<br></p><p>Customer&nbsp;<br>-- Bank 1 -- Fedwire<br>-- Bank 2 -- Fedwire<br>-- Bank 3 -- Fedwire<br>-- Bank 4 -- Fedwire<br></p><div><p>Every bank is a unique filter on the Fedwire system, making it even harder to make it flexible, intuitive software. The challenges of a single bank integration are now proliferating, and the engineering team tasked with this has to grow.</p></div><h4>Act Three: The Controller Wants Control</h4><p>There’s good reasons why bank relationships are sensitive. After all, the executive team has a fiduciary responsibility to make sure company funds are safe and secure at all times. The CFO and their team are concerned about the prospect of the engineering team building an integration to talk to the bank and move money around whenever they want. Not to mention that with each money movement, the accounting team has to track, tag, and reconcile every dollar that moves in and out of every bank account.<br></p><p>“Move fast and break things” is quite literally the worst way to sell software to CFOs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So now we discover the next layer of issues: a good bank integration is necessary but not sufficient. There must be a smart, easy-to-use, and intuitive app for the controller that allows them to manage the process. Some of the features this app must have include the ability to create rules to manage the API, to monitor what is happening, and to provide context and trigger approvals for actions that are unexpected.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One such surprise happened to us when we were subleasing office space from Salesforce. The accounting team saw a giant payment to Salesforce and came over to us, angry and flustered that someone irresponsible had sent Salesforce several salaries’ worth of cash for what should have been a few CRM seats. We were amused as we had to explain that indeed, the payment was made to Salesforce, yes, that Salesforce, but no, it wasn’t for software. It was rent.&nbsp;<br></p><h4>Bonus Act: Idempotency and Reversibility</h4><p>There are some very specific engineering concerns that anyone building a payment ops system has to keep in mind.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The first one is idempotency, or doing things only once. We put together a post on <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/why-idempotency-matters-in-payments" target="_blank">“Why Idempotency Matters in Payments</a>,” which I highly encourage anyone working in payments to read, because the only thing worse than sending the wrong amount is sending it twice.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We lived this. One day we accidentally double-funded every mortgage: many millions of dollars, paid out twice. That was not a good day. Mercifully, because mortgages are disbursed to <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-build-an-escrow-product" target="_blank">escrow</a>, we got all the funds back, but we never forgot idempotency matters in payments after that day.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Wires are not reversible, which makes mistakes particularly scary. There are other payment types, such as ACH, that are. If you sent an ACH and you didn’t mean to, or if someone debits your account without your permission, you can reverse it.<a href="#2">[2]</a> Approvals are important, but they’re particularly important for irreversible transactions, such as the wire Citi sent and couldn’t recall after sending.&nbsp;</p></div><h4>Thinking About Payment Ops as a Single Continuous Process</h4><p>Steve Jobs said, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>This sums up how we believe payment operations should run. Rather than have many silos for information — from a database to a CSV to a bank portal to an accounting system — we believe in a single piece of payment operations software. This software crosses systems and, perhaps most importantly, it crosses teams. The tech team wants to live in the <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/developer-solutions" target="_blank">API</a>, the finance team wants to live in the <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/finance-solutions" target="_blank">app</a>, accountants need <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/introducing-continuous-accounting" target="_blank">continuous accounting</a>, and customer service teams need to <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-customer-support-teams-use-modern-treasury" target="_blank">answer customer requests</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We’ve written at length in the <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal" target="_blank">Modern Treasury Journal</a> about these issues. ACH, wire, and paper check account for the <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/b2b-payments-vs-c2b-payments-what-makes-them-so-different" target="_blank">vast majority</a> of payments in the US, and yet have seen very little innovation in the last fifty years.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We believe that will change this decade. <a href="https://angel.co/company/moderntreasury/jobs" target="_blank">Join us</a>, <a href="https://app.moderntreasury.com/sign_up" target="_blank">build with us</a>, and <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal" target="_blank">learn with us</a>.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div><div><h4>References</h4><div><div id="1"><p>A fractional loan marketplace is one where each loan is sold not to one institutional investor but to many individuals. This means that every repayment of that loan has to be split between all the investors that &nbsp;invested in each loan, and therefore number of individual transactions in the system balloons.</p></div><div id="2"><div><p>There are lots of ACH return codes, and you can check out our post on <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/what-happens-when-you-ach-a-dead-person" target="_blank">What Happens When You ACH a Dead Person </a>to learn more about those.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

		<p>Our mission is to give everyone in the world <strong>computer superpowers</strong>. We build powerful yet approachable tools &amp; platforms for developers, students, and educators.</p>
<p>We see a new generation of hackers and entrepreneurs rising to seize the power of computers and the internet to create software that empowers them and their communities. They refuse to be programmed by the software priesthood that wants them to endlessly consume ads. Instead, they build a more free society where computers work for and under human users, not the other way around. The world we're describing is coming, and we exist to accelerate the shift.</p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/replit.png" alt="art"></p>
<p>Replit is a multiplayer computing environment that makes it <a href="https://blog.replit.com/internet-of-fun">fun</a> to learn how to code, build, and <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">share apps</a> with other people. You can create a cloud-powered computer in milliseconds -- we call them "repls" -- and you can create as many of them as you'd like, all for free. Repls come with storage for your code and files, a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">database</a> for your data, and a <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">multiplayer editor</a> &amp; console to code with your friends. For <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">$7/month</a>, you'll get more powerful machines and, with one-click, make them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">run forever</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="db"></p>
<p>When you invite a friend to your repl, you can see them in your editor and talk to them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">right in your code</a>. You can make <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/http-servers">web</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/native-graphics-love">desktop</a>, and even command-line apps. Replit takes care of the entire process of <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">publishing and hosting apps</a> so you can focus on your ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Live-Code-Editing.gif?resize=800%2C450&amp;strip=all" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>When you've built something you want to share, you can share the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/spotlight">repl URL</a>, and your users can play with your app, react to it, comment on it, and even fork and remix it. Replit gives you a profile to keep and showcase all your apps and repls. You can make <a href="https://repl.it/site/teams">shared team profiles</a> for your class, friends, or company to collaborate on repls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/spotlight/ios-demo.gif" alt="share"></p>
<p>Because you can make a repl in milliseconds, Replit makes it fun and safe to experiment with ideas. Learning comes naturally as a side effect of playing in the Replit ecosystem.</p>
<p>Millions of people have learned how to code with Replit and built great apps with thousands of happy users. Some have even built businesses and become rich &amp; famous.</p>
<p>Replit's design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learnable yet scalable interfaces</strong>: Interfaces today present the same UI to vastly different users, from children to adults, from novices to experts. Our mission demands that we make computing environments more accessible to novices while making it possible to transition to more powerful interfaces. Replit starts with a simple editor and console, which gets learners very far. The UI, however, is adaptable and presents different faces to different users and use-cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure as legos</strong>: A core part of commanding computer power is to be able to build for the modern internet-connected world. Despite progress in cloud computing, infrastructure remains inaccessible to novices, hobbyists, and educators. We change this by designing simple and scalable components, like cloud-hosted servers accessible right from the repl, storage, databases, etc., that require little configuration and maintenance by the programmer. Coders can then mix and match components to create endless possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People-centric technology</strong>: It's more exciting and fun to create and learn with other people. The future demands that computers and the internet have human interconnectedness as a core primitive. From our multiplayer computing protocol to our community spaces for sharing software, we build support for human beings, and we put collaboration right at the heart of our technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="series-a">Series A</h2>
<p>As a team, we've always thought about the long-term, and we've grown Replit responsibly. We have so much conviction in our mission and our plan that we're willing to take our time. </p>
<p>Last year, with rapid growth in all aspects of our business, we felt it was a good time to raise a sizeable round to make faster progress our mission. We raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">$20M in Series A</a> financing led by <a href="https://acapital.com/">A.Capital</a> with strong participation from our seed investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, and Reach Capital. </p>
<p>Since then, thanks to the new capital and to <a href="https://amasad.me/moad">Engelbartian Bootstrapping</a>, we've accelerated feature development, and there's so much more on the horizon: extra resources for more complex projects, support for any language or package, further dev ops simplifications for novices and pros, business collaboration features, improvements to <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">teacher workflows</a>, high quality content, a game development library, and more breakthroughs in collaborative coding. We're excited to see all the amazing things you build with the tools we provide!</p>
<p>Finally, we're hiring for multiple roles and want to bring on people who share our vision and passion. If you're interested in making computing more accessible while working with a creative and hardworking team building fantastic technology, <a href="https://repl.it/careers">join us</a>!</p>

<p><em>Richard Kollár is a mathematician. He delivered this speech during the press conference after a meeting of scientists with President Zuzana Čaputová on February 16, 2021. </em></p><p>I am a mathematician and I will speak exclusively about numbers and data. I will answer one question, often posed by journalists and the wider public - how we are doing and what is going on regarding the pandemic in Slovakia.</p><p>The answer is very simple. Just three words.</p><p>We don't know. We don't know, in fact.</p><p>I will try to sum up all the things we do not know.</p><p>We are missing absolutely key data to be able to assess the effects of our measures, and the epidemiological situation we are in.</p><p>We have no clue how many people are arriving to hospitals as new patients, we have no clue how many are leaving the hospitals. We therefore cannot say what is causing the increase in the number of hospitalisations we are seeing.</p><p>We don't know that about ventilators either, because the numbers we have do not match. When you put the arrivals and the departures in an equation, you do not get the number we have got now.</p><p>We don't know the age of the hospital patients, so we don't know what's going on.</p><p>We don't know how many infections are hospital-acquired.</p><p>We don't know how many patients are transferred from Covid to non-Covid wards in hospitals.</p><p>We don't know what is the structure of the tests we are performing.</p><p>We don't now how many tests have been done per health indication in hospitals, how many were indicated by epidemiologists or self-indicated.</p><p>We don't know how many tests were part of screening.</p><p>We don't know how many tests are performed in hospitals and what are their results.</p><p>We have no information about tracing.</p><p>We don't now exactly how many people have been traced and how many have been indicated as positive. We don't know how many of the people who were found through tracing ended up in hospitals.</p><p>We don't know what the effectiveness of our tracing is.</p><p>We don't know where the problem lies.</p><p>We don't know about the new variants. We probably have the best tests in Europe to find that out. We are the only country with tests for the British strain. Yet we still don't know how its prevalence developed in the Slovak samples in January. We have looked at one day's sample, but we have no clue how it developed in time. Even though there have been promises and interest in doing that, we still do not have that data.</p><p>We haven't learned from the regional public health offices where Slovak citizens become infected.</p><p>We don't know if it is safe to go to the store. We don't know if it is safe to travel by public transport.</p><p>We don't know how many people got infected where and we do not report such numbers.</p><p>We don't know how the opening of schools last week went, and how many have been closed.</p><p>We don't know how many people have passed through the border crossings and we don't know which countries they came from; how many then end up positive and hospitalised.</p><p>As for the tests proposed by the Education Ministry, we don't know how they have been validated and what are their parametres. We know they are being purchased, but we don't have a clue what they will look like.</p><p>When we apply  theCovid automat, we don't know how its parametres are assessed. We cannot assess the incidence because the numbers of PCR and antigen tests are counted together. PCR tests are reported based on the person's permanent residence, antigen tests are reported based on the testing site location.</p><p>We don't know how things stand with hospitalisations.</p><p>We have no idea how to calculate the reproduction number, which is why we don't dare to announce it during press conferences.</p><p>We have no clue how these three parametres are combined and evaluated on the level of districts.</p><p>We don't know why some districts have the colour they have.</p><p>We don't know why the Health Ministry laid off 10 percent of its staff as part of the corona-crisis measures just like other ministries, and why they have not reinforced the analytical units.</p><p>We are in a data hell. And we don't know if we are facing another wave; if it will be stronger than the one we are going through, or milder.</p><p>We don't know if we are facing the same fate as the Czech city of Cheb, where a quarter of a percent of its inhabitants have died in the past five weeks. Perhaps Slovakia is facing the same.</p><p>We don't know, we have no way of knowing what is going on.</p><p>

        <strong>Die Pharmaunternehmen Pfizer und BioNTech wollten nach Informationen von </strong><strong><em>NDR, WDR</em></strong><strong> und "SZ" im Juni von der EU für eine Dosis Impfstoff 54,08 Euro. Der Arzneimittelchef der Ärztekammer spricht von "unseriösem Profitstreben".</strong>

    <p>
        Im Juni des vergangenen Jahres ging bei der EU-Kommission ein streng vertrauliches Angebot der Pharmahersteller Pfizer und BioNTech ein. Darin boten sie nach Informationen von <em>NDR, WDR</em> und "Süddeutscher Zeitung" ihren Impfstoff zum Preis von 54,08 Euro pro Dosis an, bei einer Abnahme von 500 Millionen Dosen. Insgesamt wollten BioNTech/Pfizer also 27 Milliarden Euro für so viel Impfstoff, dass man damit gut die Hälfte der EU-Bevölkerung impfen könnte. Der Preis, so versicherten Pfizer/BioNTech, beinhalte bereits "den höchsten prozentualen Rabatt", der einem Industrieland weltweit angeboten worden sei.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Mit 54,08 Euro wäre der BioNTech-Impfstoff allerdings mehr als 20-mal so teuer gewesen wie eine Dosis jenes Impfstoffs, den AstraZeneca gemeinsam mit der Universität Oxford entwickelt hat. "Ich halte den Preis für unseriös", kritisiert der Vorsitzende der Arzneimittelkommission der Deutschen Ärzteschaft, Wolf Dieter Ludwig, das Angebot von Pfizer/BioNTech. "Ich sehe darin ein Profitstreben, das in der jetzigen Situation der Pandemie in keiner Weise gerechtfertigt ist."
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
            
                
    
    

        
    

            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        

    

    <h2>Verständnis für Zögern der EU</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Womöglich werfen diese vergleichsweise hohen Preisvorstellungen auch ein neues Licht auf die Zurückhaltung mancher EU-Länder im Sommer gegenüber dem BioNTech-Impfstoff. Ludwig jedenfalls sagt, dass er die EU verstehe: "Ich denke, sie hat mit Recht gezögert bei einem derartig hohen Preis."
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        In einem Interview mit dem "Spiegel" Anfang des Jahres kritisierte BioNTech-Chef Ugur Sahin die Verhandlungen mit der EU: "Der Prozess in Europa lief sicherlich nicht so schnell und geradlinig ab wie mit anderen Ländern", sagte der Firmenchef. "Offenbar herrschte der Eindruck: Wir kriegen genug, es wird alles nicht so schlimm, und wir haben das unter Kontrolle. Mich hat das gewundert."
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Eine Anfrage zu einem Gespräch über das hohe Preisangebot ließ Sahin diese Woche unbeantwortet. Eine Firmensprecherin beantwortete konkrete Fragen zum Angebot nicht, wies aber darauf hin, dass der Preis für den Impfstoff "von verschiedenen Faktoren abhängig" sei. Er liege "in einer gewissen Spanne für alle Länder mit höherem Einkommen". Bisher habe das Unternehmen jedoch keine Gewinne gemacht. Wenn man aber Gewinne aus dem Vertrieb des Covid-19-Impfstoffs mache, wolle man diese "in die Weiterentwicklung dieser Technologie reinvestieren". Ein Sprecher der EU-Kommission teilte per E-Mail mit, dass die EU-Kommission aus vertragsrechtlichen Gründen keine Angaben über die Preise machen dürfe.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        

    

    <h2>Offenbar deutlich niedrigeren Preis durchgesetzt</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Erst im November kam die EU zu einem Vertragsabschluss mit Pfizer/BioNTech. Der endgültige Preis wird bis heute zwar geheim gehalten, doch nach Informationen von <em>NDR, WDR</em> und "SZ" soll er bei 15,50 Euro pro Dosis liegen. Als erste hatte auch die Nachrichtenagentur Reuters diesen Preis erfahren. Die EU hätte damit also eine deutliche Preissenkung gegenüber dem Angebot im Juni erreicht.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Auch die USA zahlen in etwa gleich viel. Sie hatten im Juli bereits einen Vertrag mit Pfizer geschlossen, der ihnen 100 Millionen Dosen für 1,95 Milliarden Dollar sicherte. Umgerechnet ergibt das rund 16 Euro pro Dosis.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        

    

    <h2>Staatliche Subventionierung in Millionenhöhe</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Überraschend ist aber nicht nur der hohe Preis, den Pfizer/BioNTech von der EU kassieren wollten, sondern auch die Behauptung in dem Angebot an die EU, man hätte die Entwicklung des Impfstoffes "komplett selbst finanziert".
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Das mag vielleicht für Pfizer gelten. Nicht aber für die deutsche Firma BioNTech, die den Impfstoff entwickelt hatte - auch wenn manche derzeit glauben, dass BioNTech allein mit dem Geld der Hexal-Gründer Andreas und Thomas Strüngmann aufgebaut wurde. 
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Tatsächlich war ihr Engagement entscheidend - aber BioNTech wurde auch mit mehreren Millionen Euro staatlich subventioniert. So teilt das Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) auf Anfrage von <em>NDR, WDR</em> und "SZ" mit, dass das Ministerium "die Gründungsphase von Biontech maßgeblich unterstützt und die entscheidenden ersten Jahre der Ausgründung finanziell und auch strukturell gefördert hat".
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        Einen weiteren Schub hatte BioNTech demnach von 2012 bis 2017 als Gewinner des Spitzencluster-Wettbewerbs erhalten, das vom Forschungsministerium mit 12,9 Millionen Euro gefördert worden sei, wie BMBF-Sprecher Stephan Kügele mitteilte. Auf Nachfrage teilt auch die BioNTech-Sprecherin mit, das Unternehmen habe "während der ersten Jahre nach Gründung ca. 50 Millionen Euro Fördergelder durch die Clusterinitiative und EU-Programme erhalten." Im Sommer 2020 bekam die Firma weitere 375 Millionen Euro vom Bundesforschungsministerium für die mRNA-basierte Impfstoffentwicklung zugesagt.
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    

    




    
        
        
            
            
            
            
            
                
            
            
            
            
            
            
        
    

                
                    

    
    
        

    

    <h2>Impfschutz wichtiger als Aktionärsinteressen</h2>


    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        "Die pharmazeutische Industrie sagt ja immer, die hohen Kosten entstehen aufgrund der Forschungs- und Entwicklungskosten, aber auch, weil der Nutzen so groß ist", sagt Wolf Dieter Ludwig. Tatsächlich könne man den Nutzen derzeit aber nicht endgültig beurteilen und die Forschung und Entwicklung sei zum Teil mit staatlichen Geldern subventioniert worden. Allein die US-Regierung zahlte mehrere Milliarden US-Dollar an verschiedene Hersteller. 
    </p>

    

    




    

                
                    

    
    
        
    
    <p>
        "Von daher sind diese hohen Preisforderungen aus meiner Sicht nicht berechtigt", sagt Ludwig. Er verstehe zwar, dass die Aktionäre dieser Firmen auch ihren Anteil wollen. "Aber wir sind derzeit in einer Krisensituation, wo es das Ziel sein muss, nicht nur in den Industrieländern, sondern weltweit zu impfen. Vor diesem Hintergrund, denke ich, haben die Interessen der Aktionäre weniger Bedeutung als die Interessen der Bevölkerungen, die von dieser Pandemie befreit werden wollen."
    </p>

I moved a project from <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> + <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to…&nbsp;Rails, baby! Back to the future. My earlier post on <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html"><em>Second-guessing the modern web</em></a> was inspired by this experience, that for the product we were building, a ‘modern’ stack was not working as well as a traditional one.</p><p>We didn’t do competitive analysis against Laravel, Django, or Phoenix. They’re similar, not radically better or worse. There are multiple acceptable solutions to a problem, and this was more a matter of choosing the right <em>kind</em> of solution than pursuing some kind of perfect choice and burning hours and motivation doing the window-shopping.</p><p>What helped Rails win was that the team had a little more experience in Ruby (with the exception of myself), and we found plenty of resources for developing and deploying the stack. Rails fit perfectly into the ideology of <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/"><em>Choosing boring technology</em></a>. Another part of the product would be the hard, innovative part, so it made no sense to grapple with bleeding-edge web frameworks.</p><p>This was a really fun experience. There’s a lot to love about Rails. Other communities could learn a bit from the Ruby &amp; Rails culture and wisdom. I won’t implement <em>everything</em> in Rails, but it’ll be part of the toolbox.</p><p>Before this, I hadn’t touched the stuff. And I bet a lot of people are like that - they came of age in the world of React and Go, and haven’t tried anything even remotely similar to Rails. For their benefit, and to debrief from 2020, here are some notes on the experience. Plus, <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">Rails-like projects in JavaScript</a> are ramping up quickly, and it’s fun to know the origins.</p><h2 id="the-good">The good</h2><h3 id="debugging-rails-apps-is-amazing">Debugging Rails apps is amazing</h3><p>A while ago, I <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1321133460501585922">wrote on Twitter</a></p><blockquote><p>the real reason why javascript developers don’t use breakpoints and use console.log is that breakpoints don’t work</p></blockquote><p>After years of working in JavaScript, I’m used to bad debugging experiences. The Chrome debugger’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/05/automatically-pause-on-any-exception">automatic pause on caught exceptions</a> is amazing, sometimes. But throwing a <code>debugger</code> statement in some React code is dodgy as hell. Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn’t. You have to deal with code that might not have the right <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">sourcemap</a> to translate from bundled &amp; minified code to original source. Subtle abstractions like React hooks and advanced transpiler stuff like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/regenerator">Regenerator</a> mean that your code’s stacktrace probably looks nothing like what you expect, with lots of internal garbage. Sure, you can learn better techniques for diagnosing and debugging errors, but it’s not just you - the debugging story in JavaScript is pretty bad. This applies even to Node.js, where one of the debugging stories is to connect Chrome’s debugger to a Node.js instance:&nbsp;a finicky solution that doesn’t consistently work.</p><p>In Rails, there is <a href="https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug">byebug</a>. You write <strong><code>byebug</code></strong> in your source code, and you get an interactive REPL right there. It works in views, controllers, database migrations, everywhere. It almost always works. Variables are named what you expect. The whole system is paused at that moment, and you can actually interact with it, using all of the Rails utilities and your installed gems.</p><p>If a page crashes unexpectedly, you get a similar REPL experience, in your browser, automatically. With an automatically cleaned-up stacktrace that excludes Rails’s own frames. Like the byebug interface, this REPL actually works and is consistently helpful in finding root causes. Rarely will you need to use <code>puts</code> to print something to the console because this debugging system is so good.</p><h3 id="the-magic-mostly-works">The magic mostly works</h3><p>Our Rails app didn’t have any <code>require</code> statements. You mention a module’s name, and it’s automatically included, using <a href="https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk">Zeitwork</a>, a tool that comes standard with Rails.</p><p>This kind of system was terrifying to me before. What if you accidentally import something just by mentioning it? What if two things have the same name and you import the wrong one? How do you really know what’s happening? Sure, you’re happy now, with all of that annoying importing and exporting taken care of, but the sky might fall.</p><p>Or maybe it just… doesn’t. Maybe impure, vaguely risky techniques are just a net positive over time, and making everything fully explicit isn’t really necessary? Now when I’m using other systems, I wonder - what if I could just mention one of my React components and it would just… be there? Sure, the system would have to complain if there were two components with the same name, and it would have to make assumptions about directory structure, but overall, wouldn’t this be nice?</p><p>This applies to a lot of other parts of the system too. Rails is famous for doing pluralization - you name a model <code>Post</code> and you automatically get an interface called <code>posts</code>. But what, you ask, of words with uneven pluralization rules? Rails actually&nbsp;<a href="https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2005/8/25/10-reasons-rails-does-pluralization/">does the right thing</a>, almost always. And when it fails, you can override it. It actually just saves time, reliably.</p><h3 id="testing-works">Testing works</h3><p>I’ve tried to test front-end applications. I’ve set up <a href="https://nightwatchjs.org/">nightwatch</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a>, <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/">enzyme</a>, <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a>, and probably 5-10 other frameworks. <em>Front-end testing is universally terrible.</em> Projects like Cypress are throwing untold hours into making it less terrible, taking on massive amounts of complexity to abstract away from fickle browser behavior and complex interactions.</p><p>But it still sucks. Frontend testing has no good attributes: it’s unreliable, hard to automate, hard to debug when it fails, and often doesn’t even assert for important behaviors, so it doesn’t actually identify regressions. Running frontend tests in CI is resource-heavy, requiring you to set up headless X windows environments on servers or use specialized CI services that produce screencasts of test runs.</p><p>Testing fully-server-rendered applications, on the other hand, is <em>amazing</em>. A vanilla testing setup with Rails &amp; <a href="https://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> can give you fast, stable, concise, and actually-useful test coverage. You can actually assert for behavior and navigate through an application like a user would. These tests are solving a simpler problem - making requests and parsing responses, without the need for a full browser or headless browser, without multiple kinds of state to track.</p><p>Not only do the tests work better, the testing culture is a completely different universe. There are entire books written about how to write RSpec tests that catch bugs, allow software evolution, and aren’t filled with boilerplate.</p><h3 id="gems-are-so-powerful">Gems are so powerful</h3><p>Powerful and dangerous.</p><p>I’m used to modules as they work in other systems - Python, Node, Elm, and so on. They provide objects, functions, and variables that you can import and combine into your code explicitly. Usually they sit on some specific level of abstraction - it’s a utility for connecting to servers or a React component you can use.</p><p>Gems can do so much more. You install something like <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> into your system and it adds views, routes, methods, utilities, you name it. It’s not like “loading some functions”, it’s more like composing a whole different app <em>into</em> your app, implicitly.</p><p>This is obviously terrifying. It means that you can’t look at your directories of views and your file of <code>routes.rb</code> and know what exists at a glance. There are other layers, lurking in the ephemeral space of third-party code. They interact in serious but uncertain ways.</p><p>But it’s also pretty incredible - the idea that something like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">passport</a>, Node’s middleware, could instead be a full-fledged authentication system. It means that you have to write a lot less code, and it also means that the people who <em>use</em> that code have a lot more code in common. That gems can work on a higher level of abstraction, making it possible to cobble together software faster, to write less ‘glue code.’</p><h3 id="theres-so-much-good-writing-about-rails">There’s so much good writing about Rails</h3><p>Even if you don’t write Ruby, you should pay attention to <a href="https://sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a>. She’s incredibly wise and has so many incredible ideas to share.</p><p>And then there’s <a href="https://blog.arkency.com/">arkency</a>, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/">ThoughtBot</a>, and so many other thoughtful writers with years of experience in Rails. Sometimes it’s a little shocking to google for some obscure problem and see a decade of discussion about it.</p><p>The best practices are also formalized into tools like <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/troessner/reek">reek</a>. I’ve never seen so many actually-useful suggestions come out of automated systems as I did in the world of Ruby and Rails.</p><h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3><p>Ruby is a pretty pleasant language to work in. Sure, it has a lot of syntax and a sprawling standard library, but you don’t have to use all of that if you don’t want to. It took me a while to adjust to the object-oriented way of doing things - in particular, the idea that you can’t just have a free-range function floating out there, unassociated with a class or module, like you can in JavaScript. And you can’t just create an arbitrary one-off object - you either need to define a class to create an object, or use a Hash to store data.</p><p>But Ruby’s standard library isn’t that huge. I’ve seen JavaScript’s ‘standard library’ grow a lot too, and frankly it’s nice to have methods like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart"><code>String.prototype.padStart</code></a> instead of having every little thing in userspace. The only part that felt actively weird was <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport/versions/6.1.1">activesupport</a> - a gem that extends Ruby’s core objects, but is part of Rails. It felt weird to have <em>string</em> methods that would only work if your environment was Rails.</p><p>The <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> app for documentation rocketed from my pile of unused tools to an absolute must-have. In the world of Ruby and Rails, with <em>most</em> gems having pretty good, semi-standard documentation, you can search for, and get answers, super fast. The Ruby language documentation and the Rails documentation is absolutely great. The JavaScript equivalent - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> - pales in comparison.</p><h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2><h3 id="the-asset-pipeline">The asset pipeline</h3><p>Remember SASS and the YUI Compressor?

	<p><span>Tue 16 February 2021</span></p><p>I have no experience in digital logic design. That is, I didn't until I
recently decided that I would like to try designing my own CPU and running it
on an FPGA! If you too are a software engineer with a vague interest in
hardware design, I hope this series of posts about what I've learnt will be
helpful and interesting. In this first installment, I hope to answer these
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is digital logic design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I get started, and what tools might I use?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In future installments, I will go into more detail about my CPU design and the
RISC-V architecture, as well as hopefully answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is fundamentally different from software
  design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is similar to software design?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for my CPU at the time of writing
<a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi/tree/47e94dc6e9665f73c871add002c34d1516fd5106">here</a>
or an up to date version <a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What is digital logic design?</h2>
<p>Digital logic design is designing logic circuits that operate on binary values.
The elementary components are logic gates: an AND gate, for example, has two
inputs and one output. The output is 1 iff<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> both inputs are 1.</p>
<p>Typically, we design synchronous circuits which use flip-flops to store state,
and thereby synchronise the operation of the circuit to a common clock.
Flip-flops are composed of logic gates.</p>
<p>Analogue circuit design is concerned with the electronic components that make
up logic gates, like transistors and diodes. This level of abstraction is often
needed for applications dealing directly with signals derived from analogue
sensors, like radio receivers. When designing a CPU, this level of abstraction
would not be feasible: modern CPUs can have billions of transistors!</p>
<p>Instead, we use tools that can translate our digital logic design into
different useful formats: the configuration of an FPGA (see below); a
simulation; silicon layout.</p>
<h2>What is an FPGA and why are they used?</h2>
<p>We noted above that the same digital logic design tools can be used whether we
are creating a custom ASIC to be made into silicon, or configuring an FPGA. A
Field-Programmable Gate Array is an integrated circuit containing an array of
programmable logic blocks. You could imagine it is as a big array of logic
gates that can be connected together in various ways.</p>
<p>Making a custom chip generally costs millions, and of course once your chip is
manufactured it cannot be changed. Thus, generally FPGAs are used when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot afford to create a custom ASIC due to lack of capital (e.g. if
  you're just some hacker like me and not ARM or Intel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot afford to create a custom ASIC because your volume is too low to
  make it worth the high one-off costs (e.g. if you are making a small quantity
  of MRI machines with custom data acquisition hardware)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need the flexibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The downsides? FPGAs have a much higher per-chip cost, and they are generally
much slower as a consequence of being able to connect logic blocks together in
very flexible ways. In contrast, a custom design can be reduced to the minimum
number of transistors, with no concern for flexibility.</p>
<p>I think it's helpful context to compare the custom ASIC design process against
that of an FPGA design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Logic design</span>: just like we'd do for an FPGA, the logic design of an ASIC is
  done in a hardware description language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Verification</span>: FPGA designs may well be verified, but you might expect the
  process for an ASIC design to be more rigorous – after all, the design
  can't be changed once manufactured! Often verification will involve formally
  verifying<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> parts of the design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Synthesis</span>: This creates a <em>netlist</em>: a list of logic blocks and their
  connections. The connections are called <em>nets</em>, and the blocks are called
  <em>cells</em>. For both FPGAs and ASICs, the cells are vendor-specific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Placement and routing</span> (P&amp;R): for an FPGA, this involves mapping the logic
  blocks described in the netlist to actual blocks in the FPGA. The resulting
  binary is often called a <em>bitstream</em>.  For an ASIC, this involves deciding
  where to place the cells on the silicon, and how to connect them up. Both
  applications generally use automated optimisation tools for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What tools do I need?</h2>
<h3>A hardware description language: I am using <a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h3>
<p>You may have heard of Verilog or VHDL: both popular hardware description
languages (HDLs). I use "popular" here to mean widely used, not widely loved.</p>
<p>I won't pretend to know much about these tools: I only know that smarter people
than me with vast logic design experience have a lot of hate for them.
Due to the problems with Verilog and other similar tools, there have been
various attempts at making more useful and friendlier alternatives.  nMigen is
one such project, which creates a domain-specific language in Python. In their
own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and
VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven
model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for
synchronous circuits, which represent the lion's share of today's logic
designs. Counterintuitive arithmetic rules result in steeper learning curves
and provide a fertile ground for subtle bugs in designs. Finally, support for
procedural generation of logic (metaprogramming) through "generate"
statements is very limited and restricts the ways code can be made generic,
reused and organized.</p>
<p>To address those issues, we have developed the nMigen FHDL, a library that
replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and
synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave
like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design's logic to
be constructed by a Python program. This last point enables hardware
designers to take advantage of the richness of the Python language—object
oriented programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading,
libraries, etc.—to build well organized, reusable and elegant designs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If, like me, you've never used Verilog, then not all of this will have more
than abstract meaning to you. But it certainly sounds promising,
and I can attest that it has been very straightforward to get started with
logic design without the reportedly large barrier of grappling with Verilog. I
would recommend it, particularly if you are already familiar with Python!</p>
<p>The only downside I can think of is that nMigen is still in development, and
in particular the documentation is not complete. There is a helpful community
at #nmigen on <a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/chat.freenode.net">chat.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<h3>A wave viewer for inspecting simulations: I am using <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a></h3>
<p>nMigen provides simulation tooling: I use it in my tests, written using
<code>pytest</code>. I record the signals during these tests and view them in a wave
viewer to help debug.</p>
<p><img alt="gtkwave" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/gtkwave.png" title="A screenshot of GTKWave"></p>
<h3>Optional: An FPGA dev board. I am using a myStorm BlackIce II</h3>
<p>You don't need an FPGA dev board to create your own CPU. You could do
everything in simulation! The fun of having a board to work with, for me, is
being able to flash LEDs and see my design in action.</p>
<p>Of course, if you were creating something more useful than my very basic CPU,
then you would probably want some hardware to run it on, and this would be less
"optional"!</p>
<h2>Getting started with nMigen</h2>
<p>Rather than immediately trying to design a CPU, I started by making an
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in nMigen. The ALU is a key piece of any CPU design
that I have seen: it performs arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>Why start with this? I knew I would need an ALU for my CPU; I knew I could make
a simple one; I knew that the feeling of making something is an important
motivator when starting a new project!</p>
<p>My design looked something like this:</p>

<p>As you can see, we've created a lot of nMigen <code>Signal</code> instances to represent
well...the signals that define the interface to our ALU! But what is this
<code>elaborate</code> method? My understanding is that "elaboration" is the name for the
first step in synthesising the netlist (see above). The idea in the nMigen code
above is that we've created some <em>elaboratable</em> structure (by inheriting from
<code>nm.Elaboratable</code>), i.e. something that describes digital logic we want to
synthesise. The <code>elaborate</code> method describes that digital logic. It has to
return an nMigen <code>Module</code>.</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look at the contents of the <code>elaborate</code> method. The
<code>Switch</code> will create some kind of decision logic in the synthesised design.
But what is <code>m.d.comb</code>? nMigen has the concept of synchronous (<code>m.d.sync</code>)
and combinatorial<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> (<code>m.d.comb</code>) control domains. From the nMigen
<a href="https://nmigen.info/nmigen/latest/lang.html#lang-domains">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A control domain is a named group of signals that change their value in
identical conditions.</p>
<p>All designs have a single predefined <em>combinatorial domain</em>, containing all
signals that change immediately when any value used to compute them changes.
The name comb is reserved for the combinatorial domain.</p>
<p>A design can also have any amount of user-defined <em>synchronous domains</em>, also
called clock domains, containing signals that change when a specific edge
occurs on the domain’s …</p></blockquote></div></div></div>

    <p>Greetings from the Scala 3 team! We are delighted to announce the first release candidate of the stable version of Scala 3 – Scala 3.0.0-RC1.</p> 
    <p>This release brings some last-minute polishings, clean-ups and changes before the big release. There were a few language changes to improve the user experience, as well as the polishings of the metaprogramming framework. We have also worked on the issues that had to be fixed before the stable release.</p> 
    <p>Overall, more than <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E2020-12-02+sort%3Acomments-desc">400 PRs</a> were merged after the M3 release and until today! Read more below!</p> <!--more--> 
     
    <p>Type parameters on extensions can now be combined with type parameters on the methods themselves. E.g.:</p> 
    <pre><code>List(1, 2, 3).second[Int]
extension [A](xs: List[A])
   def sumBy[B](f: A =&gt; B)(using Numeric[B]): B = ...
</code></pre> 
    <p>Type arguments matching method type parameters are passed as usual:</p> 
    <pre><code>List("a", "bb", "ccc").sumBy[Int](_.length)
</code></pre> 
    <p>By contrast, type arguments matching type parameters following <code>extension</code> can be passed only if the method is referenced as a non-extension method:</p> 
    <pre><code>sumBy[String](List("a", "bb", "ccc"))(_.length)
</code></pre> 
    <p>Or, when passing both type arguments:</p> 
    <pre><code>sumBy[String](List("a", "bb", "ccc"))[Int](_.length)
</code></pre> 
    <p>For discussion, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10940">PR #10940</a>. For more information about the extension methods, see <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/extension-methods.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
     
    <p>The following are the changes to the <code>import</code> syntax made in this release.</p> 
    <p>Wildcard import <code>_</code> is replaced by <code>*</code>. The motivation is that the majority of other languages use <code>*</code>. For example:</p> 
    <pre><code>import scala.annotation.*  // imports everything in the annotation package
</code></pre> 
    <p>Renaming operator <code>=&gt;</code> is replaced by a soft keyword <code>as</code>. <code>as</code> is also allowed outside braces. For example:</p> 
    <pre><code>import scala.collection.mutable as mut
import NumPy as np
</code></pre> 
    <p>For the details and discussion, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11244">PR #11244</a>. Read more about this change in the <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/imports.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
     
    <p><a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11240">PR #11240</a> changed the syntax of vararg splices in patterns and function arguments. The new syntax uses a postfix <code>*</code>, instead of <code>: _*</code>, analogously to how a vararg parameter is declared.</p> 
     
    <p>An obscure use of <code>_</code> occurs in var definitions:</p> 
    <pre><code>var x: T = _
</code></pre> 
    <p>It defines a concrete variable x without an initial value, or rather the default initial value that the JVM assigns to object fields. It can only be used in a class or object, not to initialize a local variable.</p> 
    <p>We came up with an arguably better way to express this idiom: the special <code>uninitialized</code> value in the <code>scala.compiletime</code> object. To get an uninitialized field, you now write:</p> 
    <pre><code>import scala.compiletime.uninitialized

var x: A = uninitialized
</code></pre> 
    <p>This way expresses the intent of the idiom in a more verbose and easy to read way than simply writing an underscore.</p> 
    <p>For discussion, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11231">PR #11231</a>, and the <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/dropped-features/wildcard-init.html">documentation</a> is available on our website.</p> 
     
    <p>Starting from RC1, we no longer generate a function parent for companions of case classes. Which means, for example, that given <code>case class Foo(x: Int)</code>, you won't be able to use <code>Foo</code> in a position where a function is expected:</p> 
    <pre><code>case class Foo(x: Int)
def f(g: Int =&gt; Foo) = g(10)

f(Foo)
</code></pre> 
    <p>Results in:</p> 
    <pre><code>1 |f(Foo)
  |  ^^^
  |The method `apply` is inserted. The auto insertion will be deprecated, please write `Foo.apply` explicitly.
</code></pre> 
    <p>As the warning suggests, now you should write <code>Foo.apply</code> instead of <code>Foo</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/6190">Issue #6190</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/7207">PR #7207</a> for discussion.</p> 
     
    <p>We have settled on using the well-known <code>scaladoc</code> as a name for the documentation tool for Scala 3 (known previously as <code>scala3doc</code>).. The obsolete <code>dotty-doc</code> (or <code>scala3-doc</code>) is removed in RC1. We have also removed all the Kotlin dependencies (Dokka, etc.) from scaladoc. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11349">PR #11349</a>. To read more about <code>scaladoc</code>, see <a href="https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/scaladoc/index.html">documentation</a></p> 
     
    <p><a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11355">PR #11355</a> changes the <code>-source</code> specifier for the Scala version(s) after 3.0 from <code>3.1</code> to <code>future</code>. I.e. it is now <code>-source future</code> and <code>-source future-migration</code> instead of <code>-source 3.1</code> and <code>-source 3.1-migration</code>. Language imports are changed analogously. The reason for the change is that we want to keep the possibility open to ship a <code>3.1</code> version that does not yet contain all the changes enabled under <code>-source future</code>.</p> 
     
    <ul> 
     <li>Warn when matching against an opaque type <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10664">#10664</a></li> 
     <li>Fix <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/8634">#8634</a>: Support -release option <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10746">#10746</a> – the same way Scala 2 does. This setting allows you to specify a version of the Java platform (8, 9 etc) and compile the code with classes specific to the that Java platform, and emit the bytecode for that version.</li> 
    </ul> 
     
    <p>A lot of work has been done on the metaprogramming side of things. Mostly we are cleaning up and polishing the API to prepare it for the stable release. The following are the important metaprogramming changes that took place:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Add <code>scala.quoted.Expr.unapply</code> as dual of <code>Expr.apply</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10580">#10580</a></li> 
     <li>Remove <code>Expr.StringContext.unapply</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10675">#10675</a></li> 
     <li>Add reflect <code>MatchCase</code> <code>TypeRepr</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10735">#10735</a></li> 
     <li>Rename <code>scala.quoted.staging.{Toolbox =&gt; Compiler}</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11129">#11129</a></li> 
     <li>Fix <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/10863">#10863</a>: Make show <code>AnyKind</code>ed <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10988">#10988</a></li> 
     <li>Add ParamClause to allow multiple type param clauses <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/11074">#11074</a></li> 
     <li>Rework reflect Symbol fields API <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10705">#10705</a></li> 
     <li>Rename <code>Liftable</code> to <code>ToExpr</code> and <code>Unliftable</code> to <code>FromExpr</code> <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10618">#10618</a></li> 
     <li>Expand non-transparent macros after Typer <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/9984">#9984</a></li> 
     <li>Rework TastyInspector API to allow inspection of all files <a href="https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/10792">#10792</a></li>

February 18, 2021 | https://rockset.com/blog/rockset-up-to-9x-faster-than-apache-druid-star-schema-benchmark/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rockset.com/blog/rockset-up-to-9x-faster-than-apache-druid-star-schema-benchmark/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Real-time analytics is all about deriving insights and taking actions as soon as data is produced. When broken down into its core requirements, real-time analytics means two things: access to fresh data and fast responses to queries. These are essentially two measures of latency, which we term data latency and query latency, respectively.</p>
<p>Data latency is the time from when data is produced to when it can be queried, and is a function of how efficiently a database can sustain writes. As it usually gets less focus in benchmarks, we released <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rockset-1-billion-events-in-a-day-with-1-second-data-latency/">RockBench</a>, a data latency benchmark, last September. Using RockBench, we ascertained Rockset’s suitability for many real-time analytics applications due to its ability to keep data latency to under 1 second, while ingesting 1 billion events per day, on a standard 4XLarge Virtual Instance.</p>
<h3>Query Latency and the Star Schema Benchmark</h3>
<p>Query latency is the second key measure of real-time analytics performance and is the focus of the rest of this post.
To evaluate query latency, we turned to the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB), an industry-standard benchmark to measure database performance on analytical applications. The SSB was designed for a batch analytics scenario, rather than real-time analytics, but will still yield useful insight into Rockset’s performance on analytical queries.</p>
<p>The SSB has also been used for performance measurements of other modern data technologies. In June 2020, Imply released a <a href="https://go.imply.io/rs/910-OTN-223/images/Apache-Druid-and-Google-BigQuery-performance-evaluation.pdf">study</a> of Apache Druid and Google BigQuery performance on the SSB. For the Rockset benchmark, we used the same hardware resources that were used in the Druid benchmark to provide greater context for our SSB evaluation.</p>
<h3>Up to 9.4x Faster than Druid</h3>
<p>From the benchmarking results, we observed one SSB query execute 9.4x faster on Rockset than on Druid, with many queries running 2x to 4x faster. The entire SSB suite ran 1.5x faster on <a href="https://rockset.com/comparisons/rockset-vs-apache-druid">Rockset compared to Druid</a>. This demonstrates better performance with resource parity, since pricing was not available for a true price-performance comparison.</p>
<p>In making these comparisons, we recognize we are not experts in configuring Druid, so we relied on a benchmark report from those who have the most knowledge about their system and can tune it best. In addition, benchmarks represent a snapshot in time, and systems will get faster with each new release. We are using the most recent benchmark published by Imply for comparison, but we expect Druid performance will continue to improve, as will Rockset’s.</p>
<h3>Running the Star Schema Benchmark on Rockset</h3>
<p><strong>Benchmark Overview</strong></p>
<p>The SSB comprises a suite of 13 analytical SQL queries that provide a good combination of functional and selectivity coverage.</p>
<p>We conducted the benchmark using SSB data at scale factor 100, which corresponds to 100GB and 600M rows of data. We denormalized the generated data prior to loading to provide a more direct comparison to the Druid benchmark, which avoided query-time joins, since Druid only recently added some limited join support.</p>

<em>Figure 1: Performance harness used to generate and load SSB data, run queries and measure query runtimes</em></p>
<p>Loading into Rockset was straightforward and required zero configuration, apart from specifying some keys for column-based clustering. Once the SSB data was loaded into Rockset, we ran a load-generator query script, based on the Rockset Python client, that issued queries and measured runtimes.</p>
<p><strong>Benchmark Results</strong></p>
<p>We recorded the following runtimes across the 13 SSB queries.</p>

<em>Figure 2: Benchmark results when running SSB on Rockset (600M rows, 100GB data set)</em></p>
<p>All queries in the SSB suite executed in under 1 second on Rockset, with a median runtime of 254 ms. This result demonstrates Rockset’s ability to run complex analytics with sub-second performance, a common requirement for real-time analytics applications.</p>
<p>When comparing to these results with Druid’s, we observe that 9 out of the 13 queries ran faster on Rockset. Rockset was 9.4x faster on the query with the largest speedup, with many queries in the 2x to 4x range, whereas Druid’s largest advantage was a 3.2x speedup. The suite of 13 queries completed in 4,146 ms on Rockset compared to 6,043 ms on Druid, corresponding to a 1.5x speedup overall. The following figures show Rockset’s query runtimes compared to those reported in Imply’s Druid and BigQuery paper.</p>

<em>Figure 4: Graph showing Rockset, Druid and BigQuery runtimes on SSB queries</em></p>
<h3>How Rockset Accelerates Real-Time Analytics</h3>
<p>Several Rockset features work in concert to accelerate these SSB queries and real-time analytics in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>Converged Index™</li>
<li>Column-based clustering</li>
<li>Vectorization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Converged Index</strong></p>
<p>Rockset stores all ingested data in a <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/how-rocksets-converged-index-powers-real-time-analytics/">Converged Index</a>, which is a combination of: </p>
<ul>
<li>Inverted index</li>
<li>Column-based index</li>
<li>Row-based index</li>
</ul>
<p>Each query can take advantage of the index that is best suited for it and leads to the fastest execution. For instance, highly selective queries typically benefit from using the inverted index, while queries that require aggregations over large numbers of records will benefit from using the column-based index. By indexing data in three different ways, multiple types of queries can be executed efficiently without any manual intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Column-based clustering</strong></p>
<p>Users can configure column-based clustering so as to colocate data according to a clustering key they specify. This maximizes the opportunity for sequential access and reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned for each query.</p>
<p><strong>Vectorization</strong></p>
<p>Rockset uses columnar data chunks to exchange data between query execution operators. This allows vectorized processing, where operations are performed on many values, instead of one value, at a time, resulting in more efficient query execution.</p>
<h3>What This Means for Developers of Real-Time Analytics</h3>
<p>With this SSB performance evaluation, we determined that Rockset is capable of delivering the sub-second query latency needed for real-time analytics, with better performance than alternatives like Druid. Coupled with the earlier RockBench evaluation that established Rockset’s ability to analyze data being written in real time, we see that Rockset can be a good fit for real-time analytics applications that require fast queries on the latest data. These include many use cases like logistics tracking, security analytics, e-commerce personalization, gaming leaderboards and customer-facing SaaS analytics.</p>
<p>While this evaluation was performed on a denormalized data set, Rockset's design also allows it to execute joins efficiently, so applications are not limited to operating on denormalized data. Future work would include running Rockset performance evaluations involving joins on normalized data.</p>
<p>Additionally, SSB data is well structured and therefore less representative of the real-life semi-structured data sets we commonly come across. It should be noted that Rockset can support the same analytical SQL queries on complex, nested data as well.</p>
<p>Given Rockset’s ability to provide both the write and read performance required for real-time analytics, we invite you to include Rockset in your consideration if you are developing real-time analytics features or products. Read the <a href="http://rockset.com/star-schema-benchmark">Rockset Performance Evaluation on the Star Schema Benchmark</a> white paper to get the details on how we ran the SSB evaluation.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Once upon a time, microcomputers were simple and easy to understand. So simple in fact that a kid like me, with no computer experience whatsoever, could actually understand them, build them, program them, and put them to work in his very own projects!</p><p>The COSMAC 1802 was created in the 1970's at the dawn of the microcomputer revolution, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weisbecker">Joseph Weisbecker</a> of RCA Corporation. It used their new CMOS fabrication process, which had very low power consumption, very high noise immunity, and was very simple to use. It was intended for military and aerospace; applications too tough for other microcomputers to survive.</p><p>But Joe was a hacker at heart. He wrote a series of articles starting in the August 1976 issue of Popular Electronics magazine called "Build the COSMAC ELF". It described a simple low-cost computer, using the 1802 microprocessor. At the time, microcomputer systems cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. (Hmm... they still do today!) But Weisbecker's ELF cost about $80! Yet, it was an honest-to-goodness real live computer, able to do anything its much bigger cousins could do -- albeit a bit slower and cruder.</p><p>It was the ideal computer trainer. Hobbyists built thousands of ELFs, learning about computer design, construction, and programming in the process. A dozen companies produced versions of the ELF, also selling for low prices. It was the "Legos" of computers; a simple building-block computer that could be assembled many ways to become almost anything, limited only by your imagination.</p><p>I learned about computing on my ELF. It put me on a career in engineering, as it did for thousands of others. 1802's got designed into all sorts of amazing things; video games, music synthesizers, auto engine controllers, military weapon systems, and even NASA missions such as the Galileo spacecraft. Eat stardust, PCs and Macs!</p><p>Today's computers are far more powerful than the 1802. But they have also become so complicated that virtually no one can build them or truly understand how they work. We depend on someone else to make them for us, and to provide us with the megabytes of pre-written software needed to do anything with them. You can't learn the basics if there is nothing "basic" to learn on! I decided to do something about it.</p><p>The <strong>Membership Card</strong> is a reproduction of the original Popular Electronics Elf computer, repackaged to fit in a pocket-sized Altoids(R) tin. It is entirely built with 1980's parts and technology. It uses only common low-cost through-hole parts (no custom ICs or surface-mount assembly). To use it, you don't need a modern PC, or megabytes of proprietary software. Now you can learn about computers right from the ground up, and <u>really</u> understand how they work!</p><div>

<h3>What's inside?</h3>

<p>There are two circuit boards, each the size of a credit card. One is the <strong>Membership Card</strong> itself. It has the 1802 microprocessor, up to 64k bytes of memory, 22 bits of I/O, clock, reset, and power supply circuits, plus a supercapacitor to maintain memory contents without power. It can be used by itself as a microcontroller for projects like the Parallax BASIC Stamps or Arduino microcontrollers. All power, input, and output signals are available on the 30-pin header along the bottom.</p>

<img src="http://www.sunrise-ev.com/photos/pixelshim.gif" width="12" height="286">

<p>The second board is the <strong>Front Panel</strong>. It provides the switches and LEDs for a "blinkin-lights" control panel, just like the classic computers of old. The Front Panel lets you read and write to memory and I/O ports manually, without any help from software or external devices. A USB-serial adapter (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9718">Sparkfun #9718</a> or equivalent) plugs directly into the 6-pin header to provide power and serial I/O. The Front Panel also brings the power and I/O signals out to a robust DB25 to connect external devices. It can be plugged into a PC parallel or RS-232 serial port, so a PC can load, save, and run programs.</p>

<p>The Membership Card can be purchased as a bare board with manual, or as a complete kit with all parts including the RCA 1802 microcomputer, 32k bytes of RAM, and even an empty Altoids tin to put it all in. An optional Cover Card provides a finished cover with holes and labels for all the lights, switches, and connectors.</p>

Collatralized stablecoins either have custodial risk or require on-chain overcollateralization. These designs provide a stablecoin with a fairly tight peg with higher confidence than purely algorithmic designs. Purely algorithmic designs such as Basis, Empty Set Dollar, and Seigniorage Shares provide a highly trustless and scalable model that captures the early Bitcoin vision of decentralized money but with useful stability. The issue with algorithmic designs is that they are difficult to bootstrap, slow to grow (as of Q4 2020 none have significant traction), and exhibit extreme periods of volatility which erodes confidence in their usefulness as actual stablecoins. They are mainly seen as a game/experiment than a serious alternative to collateralized stablecoins.

Frax attempts to be the first stablecoin protocol to implement design principles of both to create a highly scalable, trustless, extremely stable, and ideologically pure on-chain money. The Frax protocol is a two token system encompassing a stablecoin, Frax (FRAX), and a governance token, Frax Shares (FXS). The protocol also has pool contracts which hold collateral (at genesis USDT and USDC). Pools can be added or removed with governance.

Although there's no predetermined timeframes for how quickly the amount of collateralization changes, we believe that as FRAX adoption increases, users will be more comfortable with a higher percentage of FRAX supply being stabilized algorithmically rather than with collateral. The collateral ratio refresh function in the protocol can be called by any user once per hour. The function can change the collateral ratio in steps of .25% if the price of FRAX is above or below $1. When FRAX is above $1, the function lowers the collateral ratio by one step and when the price of FRAX is below $1, the function increases the collateral ratio by one step. Both refresh rate and step parameters can be adjusted through governance. In a future update of the protocol, they can even be adjusted dynamically using a PID controller design. The price of FRAX, FXS, and collateral are all calculated with a time-weighted average of the Uniswap pair price and the ETH:USD Chainlink oracle. The Chainlink oracle allows the protocol to get the true price of USD instead of an average of stablecoin pools on Uniswap. This allows FRAX to stay stable against the dollar itself which would provide greater resiliency instead of using a weighted average of existing stablecoins only.</span></span></span></p><p data-key="6a0fb64f8ddf49a292075e3f23b3f9a4"><span><span data-key="c7f1350efb8f4be4bbfcd688e0dcabba"><span data-offset-key="c7f1350efb8f4be4bbfcd688e0dcabba:0">FRAX stablecoins can be minted by placing the appropriate amount of its constituent parts into the system. At genesis, FRAX is 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only requires placing collateral into the minting contract. During the fractional phase, minting FRAX requires placing the appropriate ratio of collateral and burning the ratio of Frax Shares (FXS). While the protocol is designed to accept any type of cryptocurrency as collateral, this implementation of the Frax Protocol will mainly accept on-chain stablecoins as collateral to smoothen out volatility in the collateral so that FRAX can transition to more algorithmic ratios smoothly. As the velocity of the system increases, it becomes easier and safer to include volatile cryptocurrency such as ETH and wrapped BTC into future pools with governance. </span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>At Release, environments are our main focus, but we can’t create environments without builds. Recently we undertook a project to revisit our build infrastructure and determine if it needed to be upgraded. Build times had become a big factor in our service delivery and we needed a way to improve our customers’ experiences. One of the main areas that we wanted to improve upon was the parallelism of building multiple docker images for a single application.</p><p>The title of the article already spoiled the solution, and the alternative ‘Release Did This One Thing To Cut Their Build Time In Half!’ didn’t quite fly with the rest of the company, but Docker’s new <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">buildx</a> project fit the bill. First, we’ll cover what our original infrastructure looked like and how long builds on an example project were taking. Then, we’ll describe the changes we made to use buildx and the speed increases we observed.</p><p>Let’s start off with a diagram of what our original infrastructure looked like.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/75WoaAxoZMIL73zK0JKPId/f98ff948f97c0cc7b979c4b4352a032c/release-builder-architecture.png" alt="release-builder-architecture"></p><p>As you can see, the requests for builds would flow into our main Rails application and then divvied out to the different builder instances through Sidekiq. The <code>builder</code> container is Ruby code that would authenticate to Github, clone the repository, check out the correct SHA, and then execute the <code>docker build</code>. Due to the way we built the authentication to pull the code from Github, a single <code>builder</code> container could only clone one repository at a time. Which meant that the container could only do a single build request at a time. We added threading in the Ruby code to be able to execute multiple <code>docker build</code> commands at a time, but the number of builder containers we had spun up limited our concurrent builds. While it’s not hard to horizontally scale with Kubernetes, we saw this authentication setup as a major bottleneck. </p><p>Another issue we encountered was that we had no mechanism for attempting to place builds on servers where they had been previously built, instead opting for grabbing the first free server. This meant there was very little chance to land on the same server and get the full benefit of Docker caching. While this isn’t a deal breaker for us, we still believed we could do better when creating the version of our build infrastructure. Enough of the theoretical, let’s actually build something!</p><p>Release Applications can contain many docker images and one of our favorite example repositories to showcase this is our fork of <a href="https://github.com/awesome-release/release-example-voting-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">example-voting-app</a>. Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/awesome-release/release-example-voting-app/blob/master/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">docker-compose</a> we see that there are 3 different Docker images that we have to build, <code>result</code>, <code>vote</code>, and <code>worker</code>. Now that we have an understanding of Release’s original infrastructure and the application we want to build, let’s start up a fresh build and see the results.</p><p><em>NOTE</em> I forked the <code>awesome-release</code> repo to my own Github, <code>jer-k</code> for the following results.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/21reYa1lgqocT6MTojva4J/0d6826574fb8718d76bfcf6c855dd490/uncached-release.png" alt="uncached-release"></p><p>We can see that this brand new build with no cache hits took two minutes and 15 seconds to complete. Next, we want to make a few changes to ensure that each Docker image needs to be rebuilt. The changes are listed below.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>git status</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>On branch release_builders</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Changes to be committed:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>    modified:   result/views/index.html</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    modified:   vote/app.py</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    modified:   worker/src/main/java/worker/Worker.java</span></p></pre></div><p>For the purpose of this blog post, I ensured the following build ran on the same builder as the first and that we will have cache hits. As noted before, this wasn’t always the case in our production environment.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/69tKlV3mBuV6S6c7BhSaay/c51464f443c1888cd4f74fe3394b32f4/cached-release.png" alt="cached-release"></p><p>The caching helps and cuts 45 seconds off the build! The uncached build took almost twice as long as the second build with caching, but our assumption was that we could do a lot better (cached and uncached) with some new technology.</p><h2 id="enter-dockers-buildx-kubernetes-driver">Enter Docker’s Buildx Kubernetes Driver</h2><p>One of the first things we wanted to solve was the concurrency issue and we set out to ensure that Docker itself was able to handle a larger workload. We came across the issue <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Concurrent “docker build” takes longer than sequential builds</a> where people were describing what we feared; Docker slowed down when many builds were being run at the same time. Lucky for us, that issue was opened in 2014 and plenty of work had been done to resolve this issue. The final comment, by a member of the Docker team, was <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9656#issuecomment-610476810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Closing this. BuildKit is highly optimized for parallel workloads. If you see anything like this in buildkit or buildkit compared to legacy builder please report a new issue with a repro case.”</a> Thus we set out to learn more about <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BuildKit</a> (the Github repository is located <a href="https://github.com/moby/buildkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>). While researching, we came across <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">buildx</a>, which ended up having three key features we believed would resolve many of our issues. These three features were the <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx#buildx-bake-options-target" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bake</a> command, the <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx#--driver-driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">buildx kubernetes driver</a>, and the ability for the Kubernetes driver to consistently send builds to the same server. Let’s cover each of these, first up the <code>bake</code> command.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>buildx bake [OPTIONS] [TARGET...]</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Bake is a high-level build command.</span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Each specified target will run in parallel as part of the build.</span></p></pre></div><p><code>bake</code> intrigued us because it seemed to be a built-in command for us to avoid using Ruby threading for our parallelism. <code>bake</code> takes an input of a file, which can either be in the form of a <code>docker-compose</code>, <code>.json</code>, or <code>.hcl</code>. We initially tested <code>bake</code> with the docker-compose from example-voting-app and we were blown away at how smoothly it built directly out of the box and how quickly it was able to build the three images! However, we opted to create our own <code>.json</code> file generator in Ruby, parsing our <a href="">Application Template</a> into an output. Here is our generated file for example-voting-app.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>"group"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    </span><span>"default"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      </span><span>"targets"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>        </span><span>"vote"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>        </span><span>"result"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>        </span><span>"worker"</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>  </span><span>"target"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    </span><span>"vote"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"./vote"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span>      </span><span>"tags"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>        </span><span>"&lt;REDACTED&gt;.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jer-k/release-example-voting-app/vote:latest"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>        </span><span>"&lt;REDACTED&gt;.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jer-k/release-example-voting-app/vote:buildx-builders"</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    </span><span>"result"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>      </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"./result"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>      </span><span>"tags"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>22</span><span>        </span><span>"&lt;REDACTED&gt;.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jer-k/release-example-voting-app/result:latest"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>        </span><span>"&lt;REDACTED&gt;.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jer-k/release-example-voting-app/result:buildx-builders"</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>26</span><span>    </span><span>"worker"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>27</span><span>      </span><span>"context"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"./worker"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>28</span><span>      </span><span>"tags"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>29</span><span>        </span><span>"&lt;REDACTED&gt;.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jer-k/release-example-voting-app/worker:latest"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>30</span><span>        </span><span>"&lt;REDACTED&gt;.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jer-k/release-example-voting-app/worker:buildx-builders"</span><span></span></p><p><span>31</span><span>      </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>32</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>33</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>34</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>There are other inputs which can make their way into this file, such as build args, but since example-voting-app does not have any, they are omitted.</p><p>Next, we wanted to find more information on the Kubernetes driver and we found this blog post <a href="https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-kubernetes-ad0fe59b0c64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kubernetes driver for Docker BuildX</a> from the author of the <a href="https://github.com/docker/buildx/pull/167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pull Request</a>. We encourage you to read the latter as it covers getting up and running with the Kubernetes driver as well how the caching works, which is exactly what we needed. With that information in hand, we were able to start work on adding the buildx servers to our cluster. We created a generic way to deploy the servers into different clusters and adjust the number of replicas with the final command being</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>docker buildx create --name #{name} --driver kubernetes --driver-opt replicas=#{num_replicas},namespace=#{builder_namespace} --use</span></p></pre></div><p>For us, we created a <code>release-builder</code> namespace with five replicas, in our development cluster. We can see the output by querying for the pods</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>kubectl get pods --namespace=release-builder</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>development0-86d99fcf46-26j9f   1/1     Running   0          6d10h</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>development0-86d99fcf46-5scpq   1/1     Running   0          6d13h</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>development0-86d99fcf46-jkk2b   1/1     Running   0          15d</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>development0-86d99fcf46-llkgq   1/1     Running   0          18d</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>development0-86d99fcf46-mr9jt   1/1     Running   0          20d</span></p></pre></div><p>Since we have five replicas, we wanted to ensure that when we build applications, they end up on the same server so that we get the greatest amount of caching possible (distributed caching is a topic for another day). Luckily for us, <code>buildx</code>, with the Kubernetes driver, has an option for where to send the builds called <code>loadbalance</code>.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>loadbalance=(sticky|random) - Load-balancing strategy. </span></p><p><span>2</span><span>If set to "sticky", the pod is chosen using the hash of the context path. Defaults to "sticky"</span></p></pre></div><p>The default <code>sticky</code> means that the builds should always end up on the same server due to the hashing (more detailed information on this is described in the aforementioned blog post). With all of that in place, we are ready to test out our new setup!</p><p>Using the same example-voting-app repository as before, I created a new branch <code>buildx_builders</code> and pointed the code to the buildx servers. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/3gqbExE2XQMNqyUQ60m27m/9e215fc99510b5a18bb6792eba5679ec/uncached-buildx.png" alt="uncached-buildx"></p><p>What we see is that this uncached build was more than twice as fast as the other uncached build and even faster than the cached build on the old infrastructure! But uncached builds should be a thing of the past with the sticky load balancing, so let’s make the same changes as the previous branch and see the results.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/2MxDyCqaSrOnffVSNC3SFu/abc0896e3eef27b927394b12fc9e1e29/cached-buildx.png" alt="cached-buildx"></p><p>This build finished three times faster than the previous cached build! These types of speed increases are the reason we set out to redo our build infrastructure. The faster the builds complete, the faster we can create environments and help our customers deliver their products.</p><p>We’re still experimenting with <code>buildx</code> and learning as we go, but the initial results were more than enough for us to migrate our own production builds to the new infrastructure. We’re going to continue to blog about this topic as we learn more and scale so check back in with the Release blog in the future!</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Turning an idea into a business can be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding challenges of a lifetime. Itâ€™s not easy, but the skills and experiences required to start a business are learnable. </p><p>Great entrepreneurs are made, not born. Hard work, drive, and absolute determination can make up for gaps in skills and experience. The rest is learned by doing, making mistakes, and adapting along the way.</p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have launched and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, and <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>. Today, our portfolio companies have hundreds of millions of users from around the world, and have generated billions of dollars in sales. We plan to launch several companies every year.</p><p>One question that weâ€™re constantly asked is: <br></p></div><h2>How do you turn an idea into a business?</h2><div><p>Launching a business is typically a one-time event. At Wilbur Labs, itâ€™s a repeatable and systematized process. Turning a bold idea into a business â€“ over and over â€“ is what we do. Over time, we have defined several critical steps that are key to effectively turn any idea into a business. Weâ€™re sharing that playbook with you to help you on your journey.</p><p><em>Note: This guide assumes that you already have an idea for a business. Coming up with an idea for a company is a separate topic covered in our <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">How to Get Startup Ideas</a> Blueprint.</em></p></div><h2>Step 1: Research</h2><div><p>The research stage is where you pair your initial idea with independent and external information. This should include first-hand research, speaking with industry experts, and talking with target customers to answer key questions:</p><ul><li>What problem are you trying to solve? </li><li>How big is this problem?</li><li>How would this make people's lives better?</li><li>Why are the current solutions not optimal?</li><li>Who are the competitors?</li><li>What is the business model?</li><li>How big of a business could you build?</li><li>Are you the right person to solve this problem?</li><li>What advantages do you have in solving this problem?</li><li>Do you care about this enough to work on it for 5+ years?</li><li>What are the outstanding challenges or questions?</li></ul><p>During this stage, you should talk with as many people as possible. You will be surprised how many target customers and industry experts are receptive to cold outreach to discuss a business idea. We recommend using LinkedIn or Twitter to source experts who know the problem you are trying to solve, and ask if theyâ€™re open to having a quick chat to discuss your idea. Many people passionate about an industry or a problem love talking with others who are equally as interested.</p><p>In addition to cold outreach, you should also use your personal network to reach out to any existing industry contacts who may be helpful â€“ or know people who might be helpful â€“ in researching this idea.</p><p>Be cautious about asking business advice from people close to you, because itâ€™s unlikely that you will get truly honest and critical feedback. Expect pushback because itâ€™s unlikely that everyone will love your idea, and thatâ€™s okay. Some of our boldest ideas received mixed feedback in the beginning. The point here is that you hear multiple viewpoints and use feedback to guide your research and planning. </p><p>Make sure to go very deep on your research during this stage. Some of our ideas remain in this stage for 6 to 12 months. Ideas are easy and everyone has them. This stage helps filter out the so-so ideas to prevent you from wasting time in a later stage. Frontloading research and due diligence here can also reduce risk and expedite future stages.</p><p>The best business ideas will bring a sense of urgency and motivation, pushing you to keep moving forward. If you are able to gain significant momentum through research, it makes sense to move into the planning stage.</p></div><h2>Step 2: Plan</h2><div><p>In the planning stage you should focus on taking your learnings and creating an executable plan. This will require diving deeper into the areas you looked into during the research phase, as well as answering new questions.</p><p>At Wilbur Labs, we create a â€œConcept Evaluationâ€� which is our own version of a business plan. Whatever format you choose, itâ€™s important to have a written plan that organizes all your research into an actionable plan that looks at every angle of your idea.</p><p>We like to work backwards during this stage, thinking about how we want the business to look 3 to 5 years ahead and then build a roadmap to get there. In our Concept Evaluation, we answer a number of questions, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>What does the product look like at launch, year 1, year 2, etc?</li><li>How will you get customers (marketing/distribution)? How much will it cost?</li><li>What are the sources of revenue?</li><li>Whatâ€™s the expected lifetime value of a customer?</li><li>How will you retain customers long term to boost lifetime value?</li><li>Where is the break-even point (cost) of this business?</li><li>Where is the break-even point (time) of this business?</li><li>How do you solve the challenges you identified in the research phase?</li><li>What initial investment is required to get this off the ground?</li><li>How much time will it take to get this off the ground?</li><li>What investment is required over the next 3-5 years?</li><li>Whatâ€™s the optimal funding source?</li><li>What partnership(s) will you need?</li><li>What type of infrastructure will this company need?</li><li>What team is needed to build and grow this business?</li><li>What advisors could you reach out to for help?</li></ul><p>In addition to answering the questions above, our Concept Evaluations also include a product roadmap/gantt chart, financial model, and start-up checklist.<strong><br></strong></p><h3><strong>Product Roadmap</strong></h3><p>The product roadmap and corresponding gantt chart provide a simple, but tangible way to look at the different work streams that will be a part of each phase of the business. The key here is to plan out dependencies, so you can parallel process and avoid bottlenecks.</p><p>You wonâ€™t be able to do everything on day one. The important question to ask yourself during this planning stage is: what is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that you can launch with and how do you build on that MVP post launch? We are believers in launching as soon as possible to collect real customer feedback and use that to evolve the product along the way. <strong><br></strong></p><h3><strong>Financial Model</strong></h3><p>Our financial model is built using assumptions we find on our own, or inputs from industry experts. While this model is likely to change in the real world, we want to keep a close eye on the economics and the break even point. This is used to forecast the growth plan, timing, and investment level required. </p><p>Funding is a separate topic on its own and there is no universal best practice to finance a business. As an entrepreneur, you will need to look at a number of factors, including your personal situation, business cash requirements, and long term plan. Itâ€™s worth spending time with advisors or mentors to discuss the best funding option for your situation. <strong><br></strong></p><h3><strong>Startup Checklist</strong></h3><p>We love checklists and have a checklist for everything. Checklists ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task. Checklists also allow you to frontload all the planning so you can focus on executing at the next stage. For our startup checklist, we include everything required to get from day zero to launch day. This includes corporate structuring and entity formation; legal and accounting prep; compliance, hiring, product building; distribution and marketing; operations, partnerships, and business development. We are extremely thorough and write out every critical task, corresponding notes, status, and owner.</p><p>Before moving on to the next stage you should ask yourself, <em>â€œDo I want to spend the next 5+ years of my life building this business?â€� </em></p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular day job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you go into it knowing what to expect. Many companies die early due to missed expectations on what it takes to start a company. If possible, you can start out part-time and build traction before diving in full-time. </p><p>If you want to dedicate years of your life solving this problem, and building a business along the way, then move on to the execute phase.</p></div><h2>Step 3: Execute</h2><div><p>Every single person has ideas, but very few take the jump and start a company. The execution stage is where you leave the planning stage and take that jump. You have spent time researching, putting together a plan, and you are now ready to dedicate time to building a business.</p><p>Depending on the type of business, this stage will look very different. In all cases, this stage involves working through your plan, roadmap, and startup checklist to begin getting your idea off the ground. </p><p>The primary focus of this stage is prioritization. Prioritizing often will allow you to manage bottlenecks and work in parallel across different areas of your business. The goal is to align your input (time &amp; money) with the activities that will yield the highest output (progress on your plan). This is easier said than done, but it is absolutely critical to execute your plan in an efficient way.</p><p>If you need to raise money or get funding, this is the stage where that could happen. This is also the stage where you may need to start building your team by hiring contractors or employees. </p></div><h2>Step 4: Adapt</h2><div><p>Roughly 90% of businesses fail, and this is the stage where that usually happens. One thingâ€™s for certain in starting a business: you will never be able to create and follow a bulletproof plan. As your business takes off, youâ€™ll need to constantly adapt and change your plan. The best entrepreneurs are comfortable being uncomfortable, adapting as they go.</p><p>The optimal â€œgo liveâ€� point will vary by business. At Wilbur Labs, we strongly believe that getting customers to vote for products and services with their wallet or with their time is by far the best measure of product-market fit. If customers wonâ€™t spend time or money on your …</p></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal">first post</a> in the Ruby Garbage Collection Deep Dive series, we went through a few definitions to give us a picture of how Ruby stores values in memory. If you haven’t read it yet, <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal">read it first</a>! We’ll build on those definitions in this post. Particularly, we’ll talk more about the Ruby Heap, Pages, Slots and RVALUES.</p>

<p>Okay, now that we have those baseline definitions out of the way, this post is going to explain the algorithm Ruby’s garbage collector uses to determine which objects it can collect: the Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm. There are two phases to this algorithm. You guessed it: marking and sweeping. In the marking phase, the garbage collector marks all slots which contain accessible RVALUES. In the sweeping phase, the garbage collector clears the RVALUES out of all slots which are not marked. Let’s dig in!</p>

<h2 id="tri-color-mark-and-sweep">Tri-Color Mark and Sweep</h2>

<h3 id="marking">Marking</h3>

<p>We’ll start off by discussing the marking phase. This is most straightforward to understand if we imagine the <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/ObjectSpace.html">Ruby ObjectSpace</a> to be a directed graph with root nodes. All of the nodes in the graphs are RVALUES. All of the edges in the graph are references from one RVALUE to another.</p>

<p>Ruby’s garbage collector starts at the root nodes and traces every edge it can access from these root nodes, marking every RVALUE it sees through this process. At the end, any RVALUE which was not traced, and therefore not accessible from a root RVALUE will be garbage collected.</p>

<h4 id="tri-color">Tri-Color</h4>

<p>Okay, but the algorithm Ruby uses for garbage collection is called a Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm, so what’s the Tri-Color part all about? The Tri-Color algorithm is a model we can use to understand what Ruby’s garbage collector is doing, and how tracks its progress. The three colors in the Tri-Color algorithm (three shades, really) are white, black and grey.</p>

<p>At the beginning of garbage collection, every slot in the Ruby Heap is white. Then, as part of the initial setup, all slots which contain root RVALUEs are marked as grey.</p>

<p>Root RVALUES are all of the RVALUES that a Ruby program knows it will need to run. Examples of these are RVALUES that exist on the stack of instructions that the program is following, or protected global variables.</p>

<p>With all root slots grey, and all other slots white, we then get to the crux of the algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>grey_slots</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span><span>)</span>
  <span>current_slot</span> <span>=</span> <span>grey_slots</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span>
  <span>grey_slots</span> <span>+=</span> <span>current_slot</span><span>.</span><span>referenced_slots</span>
  <span>black_slots</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>current_slot</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We iterate over all grey slots, coloring the slots that their RVALUES reference grey, and coloring themselves black. The algorithm continues until there are no grey slots left. At this point, any black slots contain RVALUES which were reachable by the RVALUEs in the root slots, and any white slots do not contain RVALUES which were reachable so can be swept away!</p>

<p>For the visual learners, here’s a gif of what the algorithm is doing:</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/mark.gif" alt="mark-gif"></p>

<h4 id="references">References</h4>

<p>There is one detail which needs further explanation here: how does an RVALUE know which other RVALUES it references?</p>

<p>It depends on the type of object. For Ruby builtins, tracing the references are just baked into the garbage collector code itself. For example, to find all references from an array RVALUE, the collector iterates each element in the array and finds its references. For a hash, it will do this for both the keys and the values. This all happens in the garbage collector’s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/296a2cab07ce530809ee74dee61180fbb3ca6f91/gc.c#L6269"><code>mark_children</code></a> method.</p>

<p>But, when objects are defined by C extensions, the C extensions must mark all child objects on their own. We’ll dive more into this in a future C extensions post (which I’ll backlink here).</p>

<p>Okay, so now that we understand how we find all accessbile objects, we need to learn how to dispose of all unaccessible objects.</p>

<h3 id="sweeping">Sweeping</h3>

<p>At this point, we have two sets: black slots and white slots. Internally, these are represented as a <code>marked</code> bitmap. Every Page on the Ruby Heap has its own <code>marked</code> bitmap with one bit per slot. A <code>1</code> bit means the slot is accessible, or Black in our Tri-Color scheme. A <code>0</code> bit means that the slot is no longer accessible, or White in our Tri-Color scheme.</p>

<p>In addition to holding this <code>marked</code> bitmap, each page also has a <code>freelist</code> which represents slots on that page which do not have live objects. The garbage collector iterates over all pages, finding all slots which are not marked. Where applicable, the garbage collector then adds the unmarked slots to each page’s freelist. If the RVALUES which were occupying these slots are also taking up space in the operating system heap, it also frees this memory.</p>

<p>Once pages have been swept, there might be pages which are now completely unallocated; they have no slots which contain RVALUES. These pages are referred to as “Tomb Pages.” Tomb pages have their memory completely returned to the operating system’s heap. This is really helpful for memory management. It means that sweeping can result in freeing memory, or diminishing the overall size of the Ruby Heap.</p>

<p>Any pages with at least one occupied slot are called “Eden Pages”. The sweeping phase might reduce the number of occupied slots in an Eden Page. The garbage collector will use the freelists from Eden Pages for future object allocations. That is to say, if you instantiate an object, the garbage collector will look for one of these free slots in an Eden Page and place the RVALUE representing your object in there.</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/eden-and-tomb.png" alt="eden-and-tomb"></p>

<p>There is one more nuance here. As of Ruby 3.0, if auto-compaction is enabled, compaction will actually happen as part of the sweeping phase. A more in depth explanation of how and why this happens will follow in a later post about compaction in this Garbage Collection Deep Dive Series.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>The Tri-Color mark and sweep algorithm is what Ruby’s garbage collector uses to determine which slots hold objects which no longer have accessible references. It marks all of the slots it has references to by following the Tri-Color algorithm in which it follows all references from root RVALUES. Once the garbage collector knows which objects are accessible from the roots, it can begin the sweep phase, where it will add the unoccupied slots to each page’s freelist, and release any operating system memory those RVALUES held. This enables the slots to be reused for new object allocation.</p>

<p>Here are a few new definitions we learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Eden page</strong>: A page which contains slots with RVALUES, might also have empty slots</li>
  <li><strong>Tomb page</strong>: A page which contains only empty slots</li>
  <li><strong>Free list</strong>: A linked list per Heap Page of empty slots</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it for this post! I’m going to continue writing blog posts in this series, and am also writing a book about managed garbage collection, with a focus on Ruby.

<blockquote>
<p>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away</p>
<ul>
<li>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On my journey of growing as a developer, I am consistently inspired by language features which seem incredibly simple but yield remarkable benefit. As I try to master F#, I am frequently surprised by how powerful the language is for expressing ideas while having so few features. Discussions frequently pop up about the need for ever more powerful abstractions, yet I find myself amazed by how far you can take the language with what is already there.</p>
<p>I am no programming language expert, but I admire languages that maintain a lean feature set. Every new feature added to a language makes it just a little bit more difficult to fully understand and a little more intimidating for new developers. It is an impressive design feat when a language can remain approachable for beginners but enable the flexibility that library authors need.</p>
<p>I am an Industrial Engineering turned Machine Learning Engineer, and I focus on the problem of maximizing the profitability and efficiency of companies. Often the solution involves a Mathematical Planning Model (aka Mathematical Programming). What I hope to do in the next few paragraphs is illustrate to you how some of the most basic features of F#, Discriminated Unions and Units of Measure, eliminate the most pernicious bugs when developing these models.</p>
<h2 id="the-domain-of-mathematical-planning">The Domain of Mathematical Planning</h2>
<p>The domain of Mathematical Planning is made up of Decisions, Constraints, and Objectives. A Decision is a choice that a business needs to make. It can be how many of Item X do we buy, do we build in Location A or Location B, or how many people do we assign to each job. Constraints are the rules we need to abide by. They are the limitations on what is possible. A Constraint could be that we only have 10 people available, or we can only build in Seattle or Portland, or we only have $1,000,000 to invest. The Objective is how we measure success. It is the function we want to maximize or minimize. We could minimize waste, maximize profit, or minimize cost.</p>
<p>Many of my colleagues are building their models with Python. Python is a great language and I have been productive with it in the past. Here is a snippet of what a mathematical planning model may look like in Python:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># Define a list of items to optimize for</span>
items <span>=</span> [<span>"A"</span>, <span>"B"</span>, <span>"C"</span>]

<span># Define a list of locations to assign items to</span>
locations <span>=</span> [<span>"Portland"</span>, <span>"Seattle"</span>, <span>"Detroit"</span>]

<span># Define a dictionary of revenue associated with each item and location tuple</span>
revenue <span>=</span> {(<span>"A"</span>,<span>"Portland"</span>):<span>1.5</span>;, (<span>"A"</span>,<span>"Seattle"</span>):<span>1.7</span> <span>...</span> }

<span># Define a dictionary with the availability of each item</span>
availability <span>=</span> {<span>"A"</span>:<span>10.0</span>, <span>"B"</span>:<span>20.0</span>, <span>"C"</span>:<span>14.0</span>}

<span># Create a Decision for each Item, Location combination. This will be how much</span>
<span># of a given item we decide to send to that location</span>
allocation <span>=</span> LpVariable<span>.</span>dicts(<span>"AmountSent"</span>,(items,locations), <span>0</span>)

<span># Create an instance of a `Problem` object and state that we want to maximize</span>
<span># the objective we give it</span>
problem <span>=</span> LpProblem(<span>"ItemAllocation"</span>, LpMaximize)

<span># We create an expression which evaluates the total revenue</span>
revenue_expr <span>=</span>
    lpSum([revenue[i][l] <span>*</span> allocation[i][l] <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> items <span>for</span> l <span>in</span> locations])

<span># We set the Objective of the Problem by adding it</span>
problem <span>+=</span> revenue_expr, <span>"MaximizeRevenue"</span>

<span># For each item in items, create a constraint which states that the total number</span>
<span># of items that is allocated cannot exceed the availability of the item</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> items:
    problem <span>+=</span> lpSum([allocation[l][i] <span>for</span> l <span>in</span> location] <span>&lt;=</span> availability[i])

</code></pre></div><p>This is the beginning of a straightforward assignment problem. We have a list of items, <code>items</code>. For each <code>item</code> in <code>items</code>, we must decide how many we send to each <code>location</code> in <code>locations</code>. There is a limit on how much of each <code>item</code> is available for us to send. There is a revenue associated with sending a particular <code>item</code> to a given <code>location</code>. In this problem we want to maximize our revenue which is calculated by multiplying the <code>decision</code> for a given <code>item</code> and <code>location</code> by the <code>revenue</code> associated with it. Finally, we create a constraint for each <code>item</code> in <code>items</code> which states that the total number of a given <code>item</code> that is allocated cannot exceed the total that is available.</p>
<p>This is only part of the problem. Normally there would be more constraints that would make it more interesting. This is enough of a problem to illustrate my case though. There are two errors in this model already. If you were paying close attention you may have found one. I promise you cannot detect the second.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-domain-modeling-using-discriminated-unions">The Power of Domain Modeling Using Discriminated Unions</h2>
<p>F# provides two simple but powerful features which help ensure against the errors in the Python code. The first is Discriminated Unions. If we were to reformulate this problem using F#, the first thing we would do was define some simple types to model our domain.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>type</span> <span>Item</span> <span>=</span> Item <span>of</span> <span>string</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Location</span> <span>=</span> Location <span>of</span> <span>string</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Instead of just using strings to describe our Items and Locations, we create simple, single case Discriminated Unions (DU). These DUs provide context around what the strings are meant to represent. Let’s go ahead and create our <code>item</code> and <code>locations</code> lists again. This time, wrapping them in DUs.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> items <span>=</span> 
  <span>[</span><span>"A"</span><span>;</span> <span>"B"</span><span>;</span> <span>"C"</span><span>]</span> 
  <span>|&gt;</span> List.map Item

<span>let</span> locations <span>=</span> 
  <span>[</span><span>"Portland"</span><span>;</span> <span>"Seattle"</span><span>;</span> <span>"Detroit"</span><span>]</span>
  <span>|&gt;</span> List.map Location
</code></pre></div><p>We will also update our <code>availability</code> information to use these new types.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> availability <span>=</span>
    <span>[</span>
        Item <span>"A"</span><span>,</span> 10<span>.</span>0
        Item <span>"B"</span><span>,</span> 20<span>.</span>0
        Item <span>"C"</span><span>,</span> 14<span>.</span>0
    <span>]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> Map
</code></pre></div><p>We will create the Decisions for each <code>item</code> and <code>location</code>. We store these <code>Decision</code> types in a <code>Map</code> which is indexed by an <code>(Item * Location)</code> tuple.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> allocation <span>=</span>
    DecisionBuilder<span>&lt;</span>Servings<span>&gt;</span> <span>"AmountSent"</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> items <span>do</span>
            <span>for</span> l <span>in</span> locations <span>-&gt;</span>
                Continuous <span>(</span>0<span>.</span>0<span>,</span> infinity<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>|&gt;</span> Map
</code></pre></div><p>We now attempt to create the same constraints we did in Python with a direct translation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> allocationContraints <span>=</span>
    ConstraintBuilder <span>"ItemLimit"</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> items <span>-&gt;</span>
            List.sum <span>[</span><span>for</span> l <span>in</span> locations <span>-&gt;</span> 1<span>.</span>0 <span>*</span> allocation<span>.[</span>l<span>,</span> i<span>]]</span> <span>&lt;==</span> availability<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span>
    <span>}</span>   
</code></pre></div><p>Except, the compiler is gives us an error on the indexing of <code>allocation</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://matthewcrews.com/img/2020-12-08-indexing-error.png" alt="Compiler error for indexing Map"></p>
<p>What some of you may have noticed in the Python code is that the <code>allocation</code> collection is indexed by an <code>Item</code> then <code>Location</code>. The original code was trying to access it by <code>location</code> then by <code>item</code>. This would have thrown an error at runtime due to a missing value. In F# this becomes a compiler error. The type system itself it is helping you. This may seem small, but this is one of the most painful types of errors when debugging a Mathematical Planning model.</p>
<p>Someone may say that this can be accomplished in other languages and I would agree. I believe where F# is unique is in the simplicity and ease of using single case Discriminated Unions for wrapping primitives. It is virtually no additional effort.</p>
<h2 id="units-of-measure-the-achilles-heel-of-numbers">Units of Measure: The Achilles Heel of Numbers</h2>
<p>There is an underappreciated problem in software development, numbers are rarely just numbers. They represent something: <code>cm</code>, <code>feet</code>, <code>kg</code>, or <code>meters</code>. Normally we do not care about a raw number. Our primary concern is with what the number represents. In most languages there are no easy mechanisms for tracking the Units of Measure associated with a number. F# on the other hand has baked the concept of a Unit of Measure into the type system.</p>
<p>The Units of Measure feature will reveal the second problem with the Python code that otherwise may remain undetected. Let’s update our domain with some new types to track the units on our numbers.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>[&lt;</span>Measure<span>&gt;]</span> <span>type</span> <span>Servings</span>
<span>[&lt;</span>Measure<span>&gt;]</span> <span>type</span> <span>Kg</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now have units to represent <code>Servings</code> and <code>Kg</code>. Let’s update our <code>availability</code> collection to store numbers with these units attached.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> availability <span>=</span>
    <span>[</span>
        Item <span>"A"</span><span>,</span> 10<span>.</span>0<span>&lt;</span>Kg<span>&gt;</span>
        Item <span>"B"</span><span>,</span> 20<span>.</span>0<span>&lt;</span>Kg<span>&gt;</span>
        Item <span>"C"</span><span>,</span> 14<span>.</span>0<span>&lt;</span>Kg<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> Map
</code></pre></div><p>We have now provided more context around our availability numbers. We now know they are stored in units of <code>Kg</code>. The F# compiler will enforce correct algebra as we work with them. We now update our Decisions to be in units of <code>Servings</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> allocation <span>=</span>
    DecisionBuilder<span>&lt;</span>Servings<span>&gt;</span> <span>"AmountSent"</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> items <span>do</span>
            <span>for</span> l <span>in</span> locations <span>-&gt;</span>
                Continuous <span>(</span>0<span>.</span>0<span>&lt;</span>Servings<span>&gt;,</span> 1_000_000<span>.</span>0<span>&lt;</span>Servings<span>&gt;)</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>|&gt;</span> Map
</code></pre></div><p>With our Decisions updated, we go back to our constraint definition and we now see a new bug.</p>
<p><img src="https://matthewcrews.com/img/2020-12-08-units-of-measure-mismatch.png" alt="Units of Measure Mismatch"></p>
<p>The important part of this message is at the bottom. The compiler is complaining that the left-hand is in units of <code>Servings</code> and the right-hand side is in units of <code>Kg</code>. It does not make sense to compare values that are in different units, so the compiler is throwing an error. In other languages this error would go undetected. Worse, it may not even be caught in unit testing because the math will still work, it just won’t give correct results.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and add some conversion data so that we can fix this.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> itemMass <span>=</span>
    <span>[</span>
        Item <span>"A"</span><span>,</span> 1<span>.</span>1<span>&lt;</span>Kg<span>/</span>Servings<span>&gt;</span>
        Item <span>"B"</span><span>,</span> 2<span>.</span>0<span>&lt;</span>Kg<span>/</span>Servings<span>&gt;</span>
        Item <span>"C"</span><span>,</span> 0<span>.</span>7<span>&lt;</span>Kg<span>/</span>Servings<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> Map
</code></pre></div><p>We now have data which will allow us to convert from <code>Serving</code> to <code>Kg</code>. Let’s incorporate it into our constraint creation expression.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fsharp"><span>let</span> allocationContraints <span>=</span>
  ConstraintBuilder <span>"ItemLimit"</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> items <span>-&gt;</span>
      List.sum <span>[</span><span>for</span> l <span>in</span> locations <span>-&gt;</span> itemMass<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>*</span> itemAllocation<span>.[</span>i<span>,</span> l<span>]]</span> <span>&lt;==</span> availability<span>.[</span>i<span>]</span>
  <span>}</span> 
</code></pre></div><p>Now the compiler is happy because the units are in <code>Kg</code> on both sides. This simple feature of ensuring correct Units of Measure eliminates what is possibly the most nefarious bug in Mathematical Planning. It would be hard to calculate the number of hours wasted on badly formulated models due to mismatched Units of Measure.</p>

                    <p>I’m thrilled to announce that Census has raised a $16 million Series A, led by Sequoia Capital. Andreessen Horowitz (who led our seed) is also participating, along with operators like Dylan Field (Figma CEO), Jason Warner (GitHub CTO), Akshay Kothari (Notion COO), Parker Conrad (Rippling CEO), Josh Ferguson (Mode Chief Architect), Bryant Chou (Webflow CTO), Joe Thomas (Loom CEO), Patrick McKenzie (Stripe) and Guillaume Cabane. This round brings our total amount raised to just over $20 million.</p><p>We're also launching the <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/introducing-the-census-startup-program">Census Startup Program</a> to empower startups to easily build the last mile of the modern data stack. Companies with fewer than 40 employees and less than $10MM in funding will be able to use Census for a flat rate of $100 per month.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PqQs9ECN6mKTopIPG2ZhvZL_-FmCS_h7uB_VAAizC02R6hS7wXGBj2G2ph7tafLbpJ_66C5dfvp6ljRvWCqejYEW-GHIiVWw5KEqwi42b2sijRGJsCFh-ZhMkWJffuIxVNbl0m2j" alt=""></figure><p>In 2018, we started with a simple product that helped business teams sync data from their cloud warehouses into their favorite tools. Since then, the data landscape has changed a lot – now we're starting to see analytics &amp; data move to the core of all company operations. We <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/meet-census/">launched publicly</a> last year with the world's first reverse ETL that natively publishes from any data warehouse (we dubbed this the "missing piece" in the modern data stack). The reaction has been nothing short of phenomenal – Census is now syncing analytics for over half a billion users every day.</p><p>We're lucky to support some pretty amazing teams using Census, like Canva, Figma, Drizly, Heap Analytics, Netlify, Mode Analytics, Notion, and Chorus.ai just to name a few. These organizations are unified by a shared focus on delivering personalized experiences for every customer, even when they've scaled to hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>To do this, they treat data as a central pillar of their organization, instead of just paying lip service to being "data-driven." Putting data teams on the critical path of every business operation has emerged as the category of <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/what-is-operational-analytics/">Operational Analytics</a> – and has been the driving force for our company.</p><h3 id="operational-analytics-aka-the-data-warehouse-as-hub">Operational Analytics, aka. the Data Warehouse as Hub</h3><p>Three years ago, we asked, “Why are we relying on a clumsy tangle of wires connecting every app when everything we need is already in the warehouse? What if you could leverage your data team to drive operations?”</p><p>When the data warehouse is connected to the rest of the business, the possibilities are limitless. When we launched, our focus was enabling product-led companies like Figma, Canva, and Notion to drive better marketing, sales, and customer success. Along the way, our customers have pulled Census into more and more scenarios, like auto-prioritizing support tickets in <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/census-zendesk-for-better-customer-support/">Zendesk</a>, automating invoices in <a href="https://headwayapp.co/census-changelog/netsuite-destination-186207">Netsuite</a>, or even integrating with HR systems. With our growing library of <a href="https://www.getcensus.com/integrations">native integrations</a>, Census makes it possible for data models in your cloud data warehouse to power any business workflow.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/02/Eventail-Diagram-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Eventail-Diagram-4.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Eventail-Diagram-4.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Eventail-Diagram-4.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Eventail-Diagram-4.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The performance improvements we've seen in the modern data stack (fast incremental ingestion from our partners at <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/fivetran-partners-with-census-to-complete-the-loop-on-operational-analytics">Fivetran</a>, separated workloads on Redshift, improving latency from Snowflake, the arrival of <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/census-databricks/">Delta Lake</a>, etc.) finally make it possible for the data warehouse to act as a <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/the-best-cdp-solution-is-already-sitting-in-your-data-warehouse/">new kind of CDP</a> (Customer Data Platform). One that enables hyper-scale businesses to deliver the attention and personalization that customers historically only get from, say, a small neighborhood boutique. This is the promise of Operational Analytics.</p><h3 id="the-rise-of-the-data-ops-ecosystem">The Rise of the Data Ops Ecosystem</h3><p>Census is part of a larger movement in the data ecosystem, one in which the precepts of Engineering and DevOps are washing over the world of analytics. Marc Andreessen famously said "software is eating the world." Our team has always believed in the corollary: "software practices will eat the business." We've made it our mission from day one to help data teams build solutions like engineers. And we’ve worked with amazing partners in bringing this vision to reality.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eLy_nydDOnPyVwsQEHTu8k3cGiicY2EAKJn6E8pC4gankSOLcc66qnhf1O0KiY4cD2Y6-LABH4KGMtQ9pw9D61APtXf5UPcGLp-f3bs-bFCnTsM42AInrUL6_PXvTUH6GW10t7aW" alt=""><figcaption>Fivetran + dbt + Census = Feedback Loop</figcaption></figure><p>Census takes models and insights from a data warehouse then <a href="https://whatsnew.getcensus.com/built-in-data-validation-186053">validates</a> and <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/making-your-dbt-models-more-useful-with-census/">deploys</a> the results so they can be put to work in other teams (ie. the real world). With our native understanding of dbt model versions, you can safely orchestrate your entire data operations from input to output. Census closes the feedback loop to make the whole much greater than the sum of the parts.</p><p>But what most drives this movement—and what we love most about it—is the amazing community of developers, analysts, and operations experts that all help each other to build better systems. Our partners at Fishtown have fostered one of the most inclusive and helpful communities, which supported and embraced Census early on – led by the intrepid <a href="https://twitter.com/clairebcarroll">Claire Caroll</a> (fun fact: she helped popularize our “reverse ETL” concept in 2019). We participate in our small way with tool talks and office hours. There’s a real excitement around the modern data stack, which is why we created our new startup program so folks could adopt this stack regardless of company size or budget.</p><h3 id="the-future-data-as-a-product">The Future: Data as a Product</h3><p>The next decade is going to be an exciting one for data teams, and our early customers are pointing the way. Instead of constantly building (and fixing) one-off reports, data teams are poised to become a central nervous system for the business.</p><p>Traditionally, BI teams have been focused on asynchronous, batch processing instead of real-time, personalized processing. Analysts build reports to answer questions about what happened in the business, which is like looking at the rear view mirror. This data architecture could crunch raw data into KPIs and charts but wasn’t optimized for understanding individual users or entities. Even worse, it was disconnected from day-to-day operations, which forced data teams to do painful periodic reconciliations with the business.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2021/02/new-data-teams-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/new-data-teams-4.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/new-data-teams-4.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/new-data-teams-4.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/new-data-teams-4.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Operational Analytics changes the role of data teams</figcaption></figure><p>Modern data teams are built differently. Instead of a data sink, they are a platform for applications, analysis, visualization – and most importantly, action. Instead of focusing on data aggregation for BI visualization, a new modeling layer must emerge that captures clean, unified yet individualized entities that can be used in any application. In order to support all these scenarios, a few things are crucial.</p><ol><li>The data infrastructure must be scalable, efficient, and real-time.</li><li>The data modeling layer must be versioned, tested, deployed, and ultimately standardized for broad consumption.</li><li>The data pipelines must reach any application, and be seamlessly monitored to create tight feedback loops with every part of the organization</li></ol><h3 id="the-road-map-ahead">The Road(map) Ahead</h3><p>There’s a ton of capabilities in Census and even more to come.

We're embarking on a long journey to transform data organizations into product teams. Teams that can scale to support many users and many use cases.

<h2 id="ssh-access-hardening">SSH Access Hardening</h2>

<p>SSH certificates, when deployed properly, improve security.
A half-baked access system using certs is more vulnerable than a public-key-based one if a user or host gets hacked.</p>

<p>SSH is hard. Our team learned this at Rackspace, a large managed hosting and cloud provider.
We started with deploying public keys to every server. We added a jump server with a second factor login to prevent
hacks using stolen keys. Soon, infosec team asked us to log into a web portal to match SSH logins with emails.
Evolution does not produce the most efficient result, and our system did not turn out great either.
We were missing keys on some servers and found stale keys on others.
No one liked login screens popping up multiple times a day.
We received only one one-time password token, and some folks pointed their home webcam to it.</p>

<p>In 2015 we left Rackspace to build <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport" data-size="large" aria-label="Star gravitational/teleport on GitHub">Teleport</a> — a unified access plane
for infrastructure, and we started with SSH. We chose SSH certificates as the main cryptography engineering primitive. Since then our customers and open source users have deployed Teleport at most impressive systems, and Teleport went through
several security audits.</p>

<p>I would like to share some of the lessons we learned with you.
We will start with the SSH authentication basics, dig into SSH certificates
and learn what it takes to build a secure SSH certificate-based authentication.</p>

<h3 id="ssh-public-key-authentication">SSH Public Key Authentication</h3>

<p>An SSH public key is distributed openly, and anyone holding it can verify messages
signed using its private key counterpart.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-public-key-auth.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Public Key Authentication"></p>

<p>An SSH server generates a random string — a challenge — and asks a client to sign it.
The server verifies clients’ signature to prove that the client has the private key associated with
the trusted public key. Here is how it looks on the wire:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-public-key-protocol.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Public Key Challenge"></p>

<p>Public keys constitute a solid way to authenticate and are used to secure both Web and SSH.</p>

<p>The problems with public key authentication are caused by key management: trust on first use (a.k.a. TOFU)
and rotating and revoking trusted public keys.</p>

<h3 id="trust-on-first-use">Trust On First Use</h3>

<p>When an SSH connection is first established, an SSH server sends its public key to identify
itself to a user.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-host-auth.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Host Authentication"></p>

<p>The user can accept the public key offered by the SSH server and assume that the host is trusted
if the user connects to it first time. This authentication scheme is called “trust on first use” or TOFU.</p>

<p>If the host’s IP, name or public key change, the user can no longer trust this combination
of the hostname, the IP and the public key.</p>

<p>The user sees a scary warning.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-tofu.png" width="100%" alt="SSH TOFU"></p>

<p>The user can alert security folks or ignore the warning by removing the old key.
For cloud environments, however, an IP address and a hostname can be
reused many times. Users learn to ignore those warnings, because there is no way to learn whether it’s an attack or an IP or a hostname change. Let’s call it TOFU fatigue.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-public-keys">Problems With Public Keys</h3>

<p>A second problem of public keys for security is caused by complexities of public key distribution.
Imagine a deployment with 100 servers and 10 users, where every user has 2 public keys.
You have to build a system that distributes 20 user’s public keys on each server and
100 public keys to every user’s computer, and keep those up to date.</p>

<p>Directory services like LDAP are used to store user’s and host’s public keys.
Every host runs an agent that connects to an LDAP server and updates public keys.
Sysadmin folks have been deploying this Keycloak and FreeIPA pair for years.</p>

<p>This system breaks down at a small and a large scale. Sysadmins of small systems
rarely deploy key management software. It’s not worth setting up FreeIPA and Keycloak for 3 nodes.
They use tools like Ansible and end up with keys going out of sync when someone loses their key, computer, or leaves the company. Sometimes, let’s face it, there is no Ansible and everyone uses the same shared key.</p>

<p>Admins of large clusters learn that the system of moving the key around stops working beyond the 1K nodes or 100 users mark —
there are just too many keys to keep track of.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-certificates">SSH Certificates</h2>

<p>SSH certificates are built using public keys and don’t offer anything extra from a cryptography engineering standpoint.</p>

<p>A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted party that holds its own public and private key pair.
SSH CA keys are used to sign user and host SSH certificates.
An SSH certificate consists of fields signed by the certificate authority.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-certificate.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Certificate"></p>

<p>Clients cannot modify these fields without breaking the signature.</p>

<p>SSH certificate authentication extends public-key-based auth and uses the same protocol messages.
In addition to verifying the public key signature, SSH server will check whether
the certificate is signed by the trusted certificate authority.</p>

<h3 id="solving-the-tofu-problem">Solving the TOFU Problem</h3>

<p>Clients use metadata in SSH certificates to verify host identities too.
When an SSH connection is established, a host sends a signed SSH certificate to a client to verify
the host’s identity. The host’s certificate is signed by a trusted CA.
It includes information about the hostname, and has an expiration date.
Here Alice checks if she can trust the host’s cert:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-host-certs.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Host Certificates"></p>

<p>As an extra precaution, SSH clients check if the hostname or the IP matches the certificate.
It makes it harder for a malicious host to impersonate another host.
If the signature check has failed or the CA is not trusted, either a serious misconfiguration
has happened or someone is attempting a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<p>Even if the public key of the host has been changed because the hostname has been reused in a cloud environment
during instance re-provisioning, the certificate will still match; there will be no conflict between different
public keys.</p>

<p>Sysadmins can replace the complex system of moving hundreds of public keys around
with two files — a host and a user SSH certificates’ authority public keys.
But in practice if we had stopped at this point, we would have made SSH security much, much worse.</p>

<h3 id="compromised-users-and-hosts">Compromised Users and Hosts</h3>

<p>If a user or a host gets compromised, we have to revoke their certs.
We are back to building a system of keeping track and distributing revocation lists to users and hosts.
Even worse, if a private key of a SSH user or a host certificate authority gets compromised,
all users and hosts certificates have to be invalidated and reissued.</p>

<p>This realization hits at the worst possible moment — when someone is hacked, there is no time to waste.
Time works against us because with every issued cert, the potential for compromise
increases. At least with public keys, we test the rotation on a regular basis. Revocation is so rare,
that it could be broken for all this time and no one would notice. This problem reminds me of backup restore —
you either test backup and restore regularly, or all bets are off.</p>

<h2 id="making-time-work-for-you">Making Time Work for You</h2>

<p>There is one trick that makes time work in favor of security.
SSH certificates include an optional expiry date that can be verified
by a server in addition to a signature.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-short-lived.png" width="100%" alt="SSH Short Lived Certs"></p>

<p>Organizations ca issue certificates that are good for a few hours before they auto-expire
without any action. The shorter the duration for these certificates, the better.
Ideally, certs should be issued only for the duration of a session.
In practice, several hours or the duration of the workday are OK too.</p>

<p>Instead of distributing revocation lists, we can rely on time to do the job for us.</p>

<h3 id="user-certificates-and-sso">User Certificates and SSO</h3>

<p>How would users get a short-lived certificate? The best way is to use SSO
with GitHub, Okta or any other identity provider and get a cert.
Teleport opens login screen, issues a cert and delivers it back to a user’s computer:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-sso.png" width="100%" alt="SSH certs SSO"></p>

<p>Here is an example of Teleport’s CLI tool <code>tsh</code> issuing a certificate
based on my GitHub credentials.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-github.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-github.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>The cert is valid for 12 hours and has my GitHub identity encoded in it.</p>

<h2 id="rotate-ca-keys">Rotate CA Keys</h2>

<p>An attacker getting access to a private key of a certificate authority can impersonate
any user or host. That’s why admins store CA private keys in the most secure place possible.
What happens if a user, a host, or a CA gets compromised? You’d need to replace certificate authority
and reissue all certs for hosts and users. Any system dealing with certs should support this out of the box.</p>

<p>Take a look at how I rotate a user CA in less than a minute with Teleport:</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-rotation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ssh-certs-rotation.webm" type="video/webm">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>With user certificate authority updated, all certificates issued by the old CA become invalid.
It’s not a problem if you use SSO; users have to re-login to get new certs.
The same command rotates hosts CA as well. Instead of waiting for the compromise
to happen, we should be rotating certificate authorities every day turning
them from a precious secret to a replaceable commodity. Here again, time
will work in our favor, not against us.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Use certs with caution, and beware of long-lived certificates. Rotate your CA regularly
and use SSO to get user certs. And maybe, give <a href="https://github.com/gravitational/teleport" data-size="large" aria-label="Star gravitational/teleport on GitHub">Teleport</a> a try.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Disclaimer – This post was poorly researched and most of the historical ‘facts’ are pieced together from my own recollection, books I’ve been reading and Wikipedia searches. Despite the lack of rigorous scholarship (or perhaps because of it) I expect the conclusion to be 100% correct.</em></p>

<p>When the pandemic is “over” – or, more precisely, when the right people decide to declare it “over” and we are living in a world split between Covid-negative and Covid-positive countries with a several year life expectancy gap between them – the consensus is that some things will go back to the way they were pre-2020, and others won’t. Whether or not you think white collar workers will still be working from home – living in commuter belts, in or around small towns or in remoter parts of the country side with decent broadband – or will have migrated back into the offices, city pubs and crammed trains, depends largely on whether or not you have a financial interest in the value of commercial real estate. One thing everyone seems to agree on, though, is that video conferencing technology, such as Zoom, has been, and will continue to be, central to this revolution in working patterns.</p>

<p>Whatever the future of white collar work holds, I feel I can confidently predict that video conferencing will be not-so-fondly remembered as a weird crutch that everyone was obsessed with for about 12-18 months, before people realised it actually serves no purpose at all.</p>

<p>To argue this point, I will ask the question – why do we actually have offices in the first place? Who are they for? What problems do they solve? And which of those problems does video conferencing actually come close to addressing?</p>

<p>The history of bureaucratic white-collar work goes something like this: there are two main threads of office work which emerged around the Industrial Revolution – state-administration, and the bourgeoise professions (accountants, lawyers, traders, etc). Of the two threads, state administration is the older: bureaucracies of this sort can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Hierarchies beyond a certain size need paperwork, because the people in charge need a way to have their wishes transmitted authentically without corruption (accidental of nefarious) to hundreds or thousands of  lowly peons. Hence the priestly, and later bureaucratic, class, tasked with the top-down administration of unwieldy empires and later nation-states according to the insights or whims of their rulers.</p>

<p>Obviously, this type of administration pre-dates the “office” as we currently recognise it. There aren’t many western institutions which have been in continuous operation from medieval through to post-industrial times which we can analyse in this way, but one of them might be the British Parliament. Originally an ad-hoc assembly of the King’s noblemen, gathered as and when the King needed to raise some cash through taxation, this travelling parliament eventually evolved into the more stationary one we know today, where MPs have permanent offices and travel between their constituencies and the debating chambers according to how often they feel the need to escape from those people who elected them there in the first place. In 2021, those MPs are now spending a lot more time in their constituencies. Voting can now happen remotely, although MPs still have the option of attending debates in person. It’s hard to imagine British government functioning in quite the same way without the cut-and-thrust of rigorous parliamentary debate, but then again, it’s hard to see how any type of video conferencing solution could recreate it either (just look at what happened in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB3P_0GAi0I">disastrous parish council meeting</a>)</p>

<p>What of the rest of the state apparatus? The ambassadors, bureaucrats, etc? Well, to once again take an example from British history, a small cadre of Oxbridge-educated civil servants based in Whitehall, London, used to administer the largest empire in history with no more advanced technology than the telegraph. I can’t quite imagine a Zoom meeting between Prime Minister Disraeli and the governor-general of India, not to mention with the 120-or-so Indian noblemen scattered about the subcontinent, making this unwieldy task any easier.</p>

<p>So much for administering an empire. What about lower-level state administration – things like welfare, sanitation, treasury, etc? You might not be surprised to learn that the primary reason for co-locating lots of bureaucrats is because…<em>that’s where the filing cabinets were!</em> If you needed to process a tax return, or look up some obscure by-law, you generally had to be co-located with reams and reams of paper containing this information. The fact that this constituted an “office” is purely down to the fact that other people needed to be co-located with these files as well as you. The office was originally built for collaboration insofar as a library is built for meeting girls.</p>

<p>We’ve still not explored the other thread of this – the thread that runs from Venetian merchants to Google’s bean-bags and free lunches. This one is harder to explain. As the artisan evolved into the factory worker, so too did the other professionals – lawyers, accountants, merchants – evolve into the office worker. What was the rationale for this? Why should a lawyer or accountant, each of whom has a few assigned clients, need to work in an office with lots of other lawyers and accountants? Rather than being co-located with their filing cabinets, I suppose the reason is to allow them to share a pool of ancillary staff, like paralegals, typists, etc. However, as the digital revolution has swept through (and, since WWII, rising wages), much of the ancillary staff have been done away with altogether, or else morphed into something called ‘middle management’. The function of middle management, of course, is the same as the ancillary staff: to help the professionals do their jobs better, although by tweaking their job description they were able to negotiate better pay.</p>

<p>If you need ancillary staff (read: middle management), then it stands to reason that you need an office, too. And if you don’t have an office, then you probably need something that will ‘simulate’ an office. Here’s the problem: whereas the ancillary staff of old knew that their job was to type things up, keep appointment diaries and fetch post, middle management believes their job is to hold meetings. Therefore, synonymous with ‘home working’ is ‘Zoom meetings’.</p>

<p>I’ve actually omitted a third thread of office history, which is the monastery (or university in 21st century parlance). Why the need to have a bunch of monks living together? In fact, the original Christian monk was a hermit, living in total solitude. But perhaps in not having a family such a degree of loneliness was too much to bear. Hence the monastery, where, as well as (or perhaps in the course of) worshipping God, monks partook in such pastimes as beer brewing, geometry, and science. The fact that big groups of celibate, literate men living in the same place led to all sorts of interesting by-products is perhaps the root of the modern idea of a university, and that legacy also dovetails into our modern corporate culture which has its roots in the 1980s, whose hallmarks are the borrowing of university lingo such as ‘campus’, and a growing obsession with a nicely marketable form of self-improvement which can be delivered through highly lucrative training contracts.</p>

<p>There is a fleeting sense in which a modern university, with students living in halls, unemployed and frugal, could look a bit like, if you squint, a short stint at a medieval monastery, and whatever value universities still hold is probably related to how long you can hold onto that mirage. But the modern office, with its 9-to-5 clock and day punctuated by meetings and the ambitious preoccupied by the arduous climb up the corporate hierarchy, is even further away. Perhaps the closest thing to the medieval monastery is the startup, with its ungodly hours and religious-fanatical devotion to the cause, and it’s probably no coincidence that working in a startup is generally seen as incompatible with having a social or family life. But no, other than the monastic startup-office-cum-bedsit, the office serves no creative purpose. The modern office is little more than a cargo-cult monastery.</p>

<p>Having read and of course also agreed with all of this, one can only wonder what function software such as Zoom can possibly serve. And I think the answer to this is similar to something we often see from new digital technology: the skeuomorphism of existing ‘analogue’ concepts (ie, the modern ‘desktop’ containing ‘files’ and ‘documents’). Skeuomorphisms are almost always a temporary crutch, a cognitive bridge between the old inefficient way of doing something and the new but conceptually abstract way which will eventually replace it. Consider, for instance, the transition from written letters, to email, to instant messaging. Or how indeed the very idea of an email has become distinct in itself – look at how email etiquette has gradually evolved from when you might write one as you would write a letter in the early 2000s to the modern “see attached. cheers, Tom”. Or look at social media, how Facebook was built on top of your real-world idea of ‘friends’ by inventing the highly skeuomorphic (and somewhat autistic) concept of ‘friend requests’, before Instagram and Twitter developed the more digitally-native concept of ‘following’.</p>

<p>Zoom is the ‘friend request’ of the office world. As our work places reverse the 150-year migration from our homes into purpose built offices, recall that that reversal is due to the sudden erosion of the logic which made us move into offices in the first place: record keeping and reference, ancillary staff, and creative collaboration. Zoom and video conferencing is a sticking plaster, and perhaps a desperate plea by the old guard to remind us of how much better …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I reached a point where I could barely hear the podcast I was trying to listen to. That's how loud the fan was. Then I&nbsp;closed down all open Chrome windows, and a few minutes after, the fan went silent. So I decided to see if it was just me.</p><div href=""><h3>How I&nbsp;measured</h3><p>I&nbsp;ran the 2-tab test in a completely fresh macOS install on a virtual machine. Then I ran the 54-tabs test on my own Big Sur installation, but with all extensions disabled. To record a usage snapshot ~250 times per second, I&nbsp;used <a href="https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord">psrecord.</a></p></div><div><h2>2&nbsp;tabs:&nbsp;Twitter, then Gmail</h2><p>To simulate a realistic environment, I&nbsp;did the same steps on Safari, then Chrome:&nbsp;Go to twitter.com, scroll around, then open a new tab with Gmail and open an email. A dot means I interacted with the system. You can hover a dot to see what I&nbsp;did. </p></div><div><h3>Putting Flotato to the test</h3><p>To be light-weight, Flotato doesn't just run a stripped down, Safari-backed web view, it also defaults to the mobile version if one is available. Here's Flotato compared to a regular session in Safari. Note the slightly lower CPU usage. It's kind of hard to put a finger on what exactly the mobile version isn't calculating that the desktop version is; the two versions are almost identical when you use them.</p></div><div><h2>54 tabs:&nbsp;the stress test</h2><p>I&nbsp;bet you have more than 2 tabs open right now, I&nbsp;sure have more. So here's a stress test where I&nbsp;open 54 tabs while measuring the impact on my Mac's RAM and CPU. A dot means I&nbsp;opened a new tab. Hover the dot to see which site I&nbsp;opened.</p></div><div><h2>Is it bad?</h2><p>When I saw the results I got suspicious. Chrome was using way more memory than I thought it would. Maybe it was the virtual machine blocking Chrome's direct access to my Macbook's* GPU?&nbsp;I&nbsp;decided to run the next test, the one with 54 tabs directly on my own Big Sur installation. The results were, well, slightly worse.</p><h3>The graphs don't tell the full story</h3><p>But it's probably not as bad as it looks. It's not a terrible thing that an app actually <em>uses</em> your computer. And you've got to hand it to Chrome:&nbsp;it is fast! </p><p>I'm sure Chrome is going out of its way to manage its memory usage across tabs, keeping the current tab fast and responsive. That's great if you're not running any other macOS apps than Chrome, effectively using Chrome as your operating system, and macOS&nbsp;as a kind of bootloader. </p><p>But when you're using Sketch, Final Cut, Photoshop next to Chrome, that seems to be a problem. MacOS&nbsp;likely tries to tell Chrome to take it easy, and Chrome likely <em>does</em> take it easy. These graphs don't tell that story. </p><p>So no, it's most likely not as bad as it looks, but that doesn't change the fact since switching to Safari, I almost forgot what my fan sounds like.</p><p>And then there's <em>this</em> chart. As we can see, the two browsers heat up the computer almost to the exact same level - Safari even getting slightly warmer. This probably points to psutil not being able to see all Safari's child processes, but only the main ones — despite the fact that Activity Monitor is able to group them. That's a little confusing. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e78c687e58e25134b3fb751/602feb36d1388bb94f881998_EumcL7jXYAEBG_4.png" alt="Image"></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><em>*&nbsp;Macbook 16" from 2019 with2.4 GHz, 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 32&nbsp;GB&nbsp;2667 MHz DDR4 RAM and an AMD&nbsp;Radeon Pro 5500M 8GB GPU</em></p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is the start of a series of posts where I take a look at aspects of TypeScript's type system that can be referred to as "Advanced".&nbsp; See this as an exploration of TypeScript’s type system past <span>Classes</span> and <span>Interfaces</span>.</p><p>A good mental model to have when exploring the advanced part of TypeScript type system is to see it as a more sophisticated mechanism for creating types.&nbsp;</p><p>The normal, non-advanced ways of creating types in TypeScript involve using features of the language like <span>type alias</span>,&nbsp; <span>class</span> and <span>interface</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example these:&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>interface IPerson {
  name: string
  age: number
}

type TPerson = {
  name: string
  age: number
}

class CPerson {
  constructor(private name:string, private age: number) {}
  
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }

  getAge() {
    return this.name;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, this post got picked up again and is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26179601">debated today</a> in 2021, almost 4 years since I wrote it. Some things have changed in the mean time and I might’ve phrased a few things differently if I had written this today. But still, what’s here below is what I wrote back then. Enjoy!</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_.png"><img loading="lazy" width="348" height="450" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-348x450.png" alt="" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-348x450.png 348w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-155x200.png 155w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_-768x992.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/The_C_Programming_Language_cover.svg_.png 792w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Every once in a while someone suggests to me that curl and libcurl would do better if rewritten in a “safe language”. Rust is one such alternative language commonly suggested. This happens especially often when we publish new security vulnerabilities. (Update: I think Rust is a fine language! This post and my stance here has nothing to do with what I think about Rust or other languages, safe or not.)</p>



<h2>curl is written in C</h2>



<p>The curl code guidelines mandate that we stick to using C89 for any code to be accepted into the repository. C89 (sometimes also called C90) – the oldest possible ANSI C standard. Ancient and conservative.</p>



<h2>C is everywhere</h2>



<p>This fact has made it possible for projects, companies and people to adopt curl into things using basically any known operating system and whatever CPU architecture you can think of (at least if it was 32bit or larger). No other programming language is as widespread and easily available for <em>everything</em>. This has made curl one of the most portable projects out there and is part of the explanation for curl’s success.</p>



<p>The curl project was also started in the 90s, even long before most of these alternative languages you’d suggest, existed. Heck, for a truly stable project it wouldn’t be responsible to go with a language that isn’t even old enough to start school yet.</p>



<h2>Everyone knows C</h2>



<p>Perhaps not necessarily true anymore, but at least the knowledge of C is very widespread, where as the current existing alternative languages for sure have more narrow audiences or amount of people that master them.</p>



<h2>C is not a safe language</h2>



<p>Does writing safe code in C require more carefulness and more “tricks” than writing the same code in a more modern language better designed to be “safe” ? Yes it does. But we’ve done most of that job already and maintaining that level isn’t as hard or troublesome.</p>



<p>We keep scanning the curl code regularly with static code analyzers (we maintain a <em>zero <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/curl">Coverity</a> problems</em> policy) and we run the test suite with <a href="http://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer">address sanitizers</a>.</p>



<h2>C is not the primary reason for our past vulnerabilities</h2>



<p>There. The simple fact is that most of our past vulnerabilities happened because of logical mistakes in the code. Logical mistakes that aren’t really language bound and they would not be fixed simply by changing language.</p>



<p>Of course that leaves a share of problems that could’ve been avoided if we used another language. Buffer overflows, double frees and out of boundary reads etc, but the bulk of our security problems has not happened due to curl being written in C.</p>



<h2>C is not a new dependency</h2>



<p>It is easy for projects to add a dependency on a library that is written in C since that’s what operating systems and system libraries are written in, still today in 2017. That’s the default. Everyone can build and install such libraries and they’re used and people know how they work.</p>



<p>A library in another language will add that language (and compiler, and debugger and whatever dependencies a libcurl written in that language would need) as a new dependency to a large amount of projects that are themselves written in C or C++ today. Those projects would in many cases downright ignore and reject projects written in “an alternative language”.</p>



<h2>curl sits in the boat</h2>



<p>In the curl project we’re deliberately conservative and we stick to old standards, to remain a viable and reliable library for everyone. Right now and for the foreseeable future. Things that worked in curl 15 years ago still work like that today. The same way. Users can rely on curl. We stick around. We don’t knee-jerk react to modern trends. We sit still in the boat. We don’t rock it.</p>



<h2>Rewriting means adding heaps of bugs</h2>



<p>The plain fact, that also isn’t really about languages but is about plain old software engineering: translating or rewriting curl into a new language will introduce a lot of bugs. Bugs that we don’t have today.</p>



<p>Not to mention how rewriting would take a huge effort and a lot of time. That energy can instead today be spent on improving curl further.</p>



<h2>What if</h2>



<p><em>If I would start the project today, would I’ve picked another language?</em> Maybe. Maybe not. If memory safety and related issues was the primary concern I had, then sure. But as I’ve mentioned above there are several others concerns too so it would really depend on my priorities.</p>



<h2>Finally</h2>



<p>At the end of the day the question that remains is: would we gain more than we would pay, and over which time frame? Who would gain and who would lose?</p>



<p>I’m sure that there will be or it may even already exist, curl and libcurl competitors and potent alternatives written in most of these new alternative languages. Some of them are absolutely really good and will get used and reach fame and glory. Some of them will be crap. Just like software always work. Let a thousand curl competitors bloom!</p>



<p>Will curl be rewritten at some point in the future? I won’t rule it out, but I find it unlikely. I find it even more unlikely that it will happen in the short term or within the next few years.</p>

<p>Any company that supports bitcoin is making one thing clear: they don’t care about the environment. At a time when global warming is a real threat to the planet, bitcoin is one of the worst offenders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The global network of computers that “mine” bitcoin consumes an entire country’s worth of energy in their race to win the next block on the blockchain—and get the 6.25 bitcoin block reward, currently worth $300,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since PayPal, Square, MicroStrategy, and <a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/02/08/tesla-spent-1-5b-in-clean-car-credits-on-bitcoin-the-filthiest-asset-imaginable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a> got onto the game—and started shilling bitcoin on social media—the price of bitcoin has soared to new heights. And the higher the bitcoin price, the greater the lure for people to invest in warehouses full of power-hungry rigs to mine bitcoin for profit. </p>



<p>Digiconomist’s <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index,</a> run by Alex de Vries, a blockchain specialist at Big Four accounting firm PwC, estimates bitcoin’s energy consumption to be 79 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, on par with the entire country of Chile. Per his index, bitcoin also emits 37 megatons of carbon dioxide per year, comparable to that of New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School figure bitcoin’s power consumption to be even higher. According to their <a href="https://cbeci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index,</a> bitcoin consumes 124 terawatt-hours of electricity a year, bringing it inline with countries like Argentina and Norway.</p>



<p>In October, just before PayPal announced it would allow users to buy and sell bitcoin via their digital wallets, bitcoin’s power consumption was 75 terawatt-hours per year, according to the CBECI. Since then, bitcoin’s price climbed from $10,000 to upwards of $50,000, increasing its energy consumption by 40 percent the process.</p>



<p>In 2018, all of the world’s data centers consumed <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6481/984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">205 terawatt-hours of electricity,</a> or 1% of all of the world’s electricity. Bitcoin accounts for half of that. </p>



<p>Can the world’s power grids tolerate this added demand for electricity in the midst of global warming? In the U.S., we are already seeing the impact of extreme weather on our power grids—millions in Texas <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/millions-texans-left-shivering-arctic-cold-without-power-n1257959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shivering in cold, dark homes</a> this week.

<h2><strong>Coal powered&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>And bitcoin’s energy consumption isn’t green either—though bitcoiners like to say that it is. Bitcoin miners are tuned to profits. That means the fastest rigs and the cheapest energy available, mostly in the form of fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Coal is fueling bitcoin,” Christian Stoll, an energy researcher at the Technical University of Munich, told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoins-climate-impact-global-cures-local/?mbid=social_twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_campaign=wired&amp;utm_campaign=wired&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired magazine</a> a few years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30255-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper published in <em>Joule</em></a> in June 2019, Stoll and his researchers examined bitcoin mining based on where miners are located and the types of rigs they use. Two-thirds of all bitcoin mining is centered in China, 17% is in Europe, and 15% in North America, the researchers found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In China, bitcoin’s mining is spread throughout the country’s sprawling western provinces, Sichuan and Yunnan, and also in the north, in Xinjiang and Mongolia. In the Sichuan province, where about 58% of the world’s bitcoin mining takes place, miners take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power—but only during the rainy season, which lasts about six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin is a 24/7 business, however, and when green energy isn’t available—and the price of bitcoin is high enough to reap a profit in the dry season—the miners in Sichuan turn to coal, the country’s most abundant energy source. <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics?country=CHINA&amp;fuel=Energy%20supply&amp;indicator=ElecGenByFuel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sixty-five percent of China’s electricity comes from coal.</a>&nbsp;Bitcoin miners in the Xinjiang province and inner Mongolia also rely heavily on coal-fired electricity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when bitcoin uses clean energy, that pushes the use of dirty energy elsewhere. A few years ago, HyperBlock, a bitcoin mine in Missoula County, Montana, struck a deal with a nearby dam for cheap renewable power. They thought they were doing it right, until county officials noted that if energy from the dam went to bitcoin mining, the county as a whole would end up using more coal. </p>



<p>That was the end of that. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/montana-county-crimp-bitcoin-save-the-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In April 2019,</a> Missoula required all future mines to purchase or build their own renewable power. And soon after the price of bitcoin crashed in March 2020—slipping down to below $5,000—HyperBlock <a href="https://missoulian.com/news/local/bonner-bitcoin-company-ceases-operations/article_789d8594-f17c-5809-a8fe-918ad226266e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared bankruptcy</a> because it could not pay its power bills.</p>



<h2><strong>Bitcoin mining and proof of work</strong></h2>



<p>Why is bitcoin so inefficient? It turns out that the system uses copious amounts energy not by accident but by design. </p>



<p>Satoshi Nakomoto, bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, had to figure out a way to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double-spend problem.</a> We don’t have this problem with paper money. But with digital money, someone could copy the file and use it to spend the funds over and over, rendering the currency useless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a centralized system, a trusted third-party, like a bank, checks the digital money you spend against a central ledger to make sure there’s no funny business going on. But bitcoin’s ledger (the blockchain) is decentralized, which makes the double-spend problem harder to solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The solution Satoshi came up with was a clever hack that involves bitcoin mining and proof-of-work. In bitcoin, mining is the process of adding new transactions to the blockchain, and proof-of-work secures the network so transactions can’t be reversed. You would need more than half of all the computing power on the bitcoin network to double-spend a bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn’t a perfect solution, but Satoshi solved what computer scientists had long thought was unsolvable: how to build a decentralized payment system. The irony is, unless you are collecting payments for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ransomware-ryuk-rakes-in-150-million-in-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ransomware,</a> bitcoin has proven <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-bitcoin-hasnt-gained-traction-as-a-form-of-payment-11612886974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unusable as a payment system.</a> No merchant wants to risk their profit margin on bitcoin’s volatility. </p>



<p>Today, bitcoin functions mainly as a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/store-of-value-remains-cryptos-best-use-case" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculative investment,</a> getting scooped up by retailers and venture capitalists—and now big companies and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pension-funds-are-getting-in-on-bitcoin-according-to-grayscalehttps://www.hedgeweek.com/2021/01/19/294600/bitcoins-inefficiencies-are-creating-arbitrage-trades-crypto-hedge-funds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hedge funds</a>—in the hopes the price will go ever skyward.  &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Winning the lottery</h2>



<p>Bitcoin miners have their eyes feasted on the bitcoin block reward. </p>



<p>Every 10 minutes, the bitcoin network adds a new block to the blockchain, minting 900 new bitcoins a day in the process. That block reward is reduced by half every four years. Prior to May 2020, the bitcoin block reward was 12.5 bitcoins—double what it is now—and the network produced 1,800 new bitcoins per day. And around February 2024,* the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoins. </p>



<p>When you request a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain, your transaction goes into the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/mempool-size" target="_blank">bitcoin mempool,</a> a waiting area for unconfirmed bitcoin transactions. Miners select transactions from the pool—usually the ones with the highest transaction fees—and package those into a block ready to process as the next block in the blockchain. </p>



<p>Any server can produce a “candidate block,” but if it were too easy to do, the network would be spammed. So there had to be a financial cost to creating a block, hence the work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of bitcoin, that work involves solving a hash puzzle; the cost is computing time and electricity. The hash puzzle is very difficult to solve, but easy for peers in the bitcoin network to verify, so they can prove you did the work and the block is valid.</p>



<p>Some people refer to this puzzle as a complex math problem, but it’s really not. Working out a hash is easy, but in bitcoin, working out a hash that meets certain conditions is tricky. Finding the solution is a bit like winning a lottery.</p>



<h2>Solving the hash puzzle</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hash</a> is a fixed-length output calculated from a piece of data. Whether you hash Herman Wouk’s “War and Remembrance” or a grocery store list, the resultant hash will always be the same length. And you will always get the same hash for the same string. But if even one letter changes in “War and Remembrance,” the resultant hash will be different.</p>



<p>Bitcoin uses the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash" target="_blank">hashcash proof-of-work,</a> originally developed by cryptographer Adam Back in 1997 as a way to prevent email spam and denial-of-service attacks, and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA-256</a> hashing function, which has been around since 2001.</p>



<p>When you hash a bitcoin block, you also track the hash of the previous block—which “chains” a block to the one before it, and so on down the line to the first bitcoin block ever created—and a random number called a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce" target="_blank">nonce.</a> The idea is to produce a hash that is lower than the numeric value of the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network target.</a> (This target changes periodically to adjust the mining difficulty, thereby assuring only one block gets created every 10 minutes.) </p>



<p>When you mine bitcoin, you repeatedly hash the block while incrementing the nonce. Each time you change the nonce, you also change the value of the resultant hash. The number of hashes that a miner makes per second is called the hash rate; the higher your hash rate, the better your chance of solving the puzzle. A single bitcoin mining rig can make up to 14 trillion guesses per second.</p>



<p>If you discover a hash value that is small enough before anyone else does, you win! Your block is then transmitted to the rest of the network, and the other nodes begin work on the next block using the hash of the accepted block.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Powerful computers</h2>



<p>As bitcoin went up in value over the years, miners found faster and faster ways to win the bitcoin lottery. When bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, you could mine bitcoin with the CPU on your own personal computer.</p>



<p>Those days are a distant memory. As bitcoin mining became more profitable, miners switched to graphic processing units (GPUs). And in 2011, they migrated to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). But starting in 2013, the field was taken over by application-specific integrated circuit equipment (ASIC) rigs—which is …</p></div></article></div>

<h3><em>This is part of our article series published as “OpenZFS in Depth”. <a href="https://klarasystems.com/articles/"><strong><span>Subscribe to our article series</span></strong> </a>to find out more about the secrets of OpenZFS</em></h3>



<hr>



<p><strong><em>Isaac Huang’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPU3rIHyCTs">talk at the OpenZFS 2017 developers summit</a> witnessed the expansion of the ZFS storage endurance envelope for large installations.&nbsp; dRAID or distributed RAID is a new vdev type that complements existing ZFS data protection capabilities for very large storage arrays.&nbsp; Starting with the RAID-Z-like underpinnings, dRAID permutes, or mixes, disk blocks together in a way where accesses are evenly spread across all the drives. Fast spindle replacement is accomplished by using all members of the pool, using pre-allocated virtual spares, spread evenly over all the spindles. Contributors include Intel, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and HP Enterprise, which have material interest in storage at datacenter scale and high reliability. The OpenZFS user community are the benefactors of this enhancement if we apply it well.</em></strong></p>



<h3><strong>Avoiding the Death Spiral</strong></h3>



<p>Admins will often use wide RAID stripes to maximize usable storage given a number of spindles. RAID-Z deployments with large stripe widths, ten or larger, are subject to poor resilver performance for a number of reasons. Resilvering a full vdev means reading from every healthy disk and continuously writing to the new spare. This will saturate the replacement disk with writes while scattering seeks over the rest of the vdev. For 14 wide RAID-Z2 vdevs using 12TB spindles, rebuilds can take weeks. Resilver I/O activity is deprioritized when the system has not been idle for a minimum period. Full zpools get fragmented and require additional I/O’s to recalculate data during reslivering. A pool can degenerate into a never ending cycle of rebuilds or loss of the pool Aka: the Death Spiral.</p>



<p>As spindles age together, disks may fail in groups as defect counts and mechanical failure are not independent random processes with respect to age. SSD’s further complicate this math as the wear leveling endurance will be very closely matched and clusters of devices under identical load may fail together.&nbsp; Manufacturer provided mean time to failure is a forward-looking statement and is not suitable for replenishment planning. One manufacturer claims 1.2 Million hour MTBF: a dubious 137 year commitment to quality. It’s poor planning to assume any drive isn’t going to pick today to dramatically fail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>dRAID is an option providing rapid parity rebuild that can mitigate the death spiral behaviour of wide RAIDZ stripes, but as reflected in its default width setting of eight, it does not encourage wide stripes. Dedicating sufficient parity increases the durability of the ZFS pool and the investment in parity should be informed by the risk of losing the pool.</p>



<h3><strong>Distributed Spares?</strong></h3>



<p>Spare disks are a way of keeping a disk warm and ready to replace a failed member. Usually, a spare’s life is leisurely idle until they are scrammed into action during a rebuild. That idleness is a wasted opportunity to do useful work. There are no specific spare disks in a dRAID. Rather, enough blocks are allocated throughout out the vdev to act as spares. The distributed spare is a clever redistribution of work so that all disks are always in use. A disk failure precipitates a rebuild into that dedicated space. After replacement disks are available, the vdev can be re-balanced to return the spare block and put the replacement disk in to use.</p>



<h3><strong><strong><strong>Fixed Stripe Width</strong></strong></strong></h3>



<p>Unlike RAID-Z, an entire stripe in dRAID is allocated at once, no matter how many disk blocks are needed to store the object. The stripe width is determined by the disk sector size multiplied by the number of data drives in the RAID group.</p>



<div data-columns="3" data-layout="50-25-25"><div>




<div><div>
<p>Did you know?</p>

</div></div>




</div></div>



<p>RAID-Z has a method of optimizing block layout to minimize block allocations for small files. dRAID however priorities the speed of rebuilding parity and does not make the same space preserving attempt. If your files are a small fraction of the stripe size, dRAID will not be able to use all the disk blocks fully. For example, a default dRAID vdev has a stripe with of 32k (4k per disk, 8 disks); any allocation will require at least 32k. Internal padding is allocated to fill out the stripe width after the request object is stored. Using a smaller stripe width or providing a special mirror vdev will suit smaller allocations and improve drive utilization.</p>



<h3><strong>A Tale of Two Resilvers</strong></h3>



<p>After a failure, the real or distributed spare is written to in sequence, following only the parity layout in the space map to rebuild the drive according to parity data. Sequential reconstruction can be accomplished rapidly by issuing large I/O blocks, reducing seeks, and avoiding tree indirection overhead. The rebuilt disk’s contents are not necessarily consistent with the Merkle tree that proves the zpools data is intact.&nbsp; It’s important to reconstruct this bitwise copy of the disk first, allowing the system to return to mostly intact state and return to service. That is to say, the sequential reconstruction process restores the redundancy level of the pool, but without being able to verify the checksums of the data. The advantage to this is that it can be completed much more quickly, reducing the window during which additional disk failures might put the pool at risk.</p>



<p>A healing resilver is triggered automatically after a sequential resilver, it is a final operation that verifies that all the contents of the drives match their initial checksums via block pointer traversal. The healing resilver has a number of optimizations to quickly find and reconstruct writes to the failed disk. When a replacement drive can be added to the pool, the rebalance operation is another sequential resilver followed by a healing resilver.</p>



<p>A scrub is the gold standard for a pool health; however, a scrub might be a prohibitive amount of work, visiting every block allocated in the pool. The healing resilver allows a practical return to operation in an environment where failures must be repaired routinely.</p>



<h3><strong><em>“Are We There Yet? When Can I Play With it?”</em></strong></h3>



<p>According to a report from the January OpenZFS leadership meeting, OpenZFS 2.1 will support dRAID in early 2021. If you must have it now; the head branch of the OpenZFS build against recently supported operating systems: FreeBSD 12.1+, Linux 5.10+, Illumos, NetBSD et al. The OpenZFS regression test suite ztest is a good indication that dRAID satisfies the ZFS commitment to data protection. Corporate customers at IBM and Panasas have been flogging other distributed RAID systems for more than ten years. It’s a mature concept that complements the ZFS tool set.</p>



<h4><strong>Quick Start</strong></h4>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no better way to learn software than to run headlong into mistakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’ll install ZFS head from source and gin up some ‘md’ file backed disks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘zpool create r2dRAID dRAID2:3d:1s:14c /dev/md1 /dev/md2 ….&nbsp; /dev/md13 /dev/md14’</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it is, a zpool with a dRAID vdev, ready to go to work.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The OpenZFS wiki has a good description of <a href="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Basic%20Concepts/dRAID%20Howto.html">dRAID care, resilvering and rebalancing</a></p>



<p>Following the life cycle of failure and replacement in the documentation is recommended before those skills are tested in production.</p>



<h4><strong>dRAID Nomenclature</strong></h4>



<p>Let’s decode the nomenclature that describes the geometry of a dRAID vdev. A string such as “dRAID2:3d:14c:1s” encodes the following about a dRAID vdev.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -dRAID[&lt;parity&gt;][:&lt;data&gt;d][:&lt;children&gt;c][:&lt;spares&gt;s]</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -parity: Required, the number of spindles to use to store parity information. Eg: A dRAID3 can survive until a fourth disk failure without losing data. Parity may be 1,2 or 3.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -[d] data: (spindles per RAID group): Determines the width of the data stripe, 8 is the default. Larger values will increase the stripe width and reduce total parity.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -[c] children: This parameter should match the number of device entries that you feed to the vdev. A helpful check will warn you if you don’t get the right number of disks named correctly: “invalid number of dRAID children; 14 required but 13 provided”</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -[s] spares: The number of disk areas to mix in as distributed spares. No spares are created by default, a maximum of four are welcome. Each spare will remove a fraction of space from every disk.</p>



<h2><strong>Parting Short</strong></h2>



<p>The dRAID offers a solution for large arrays, vdevs with fewer than 20 spindles will have limited benefits from the new option. The performance and resilver result will be similar to RAIDZ for small numbers of spindles. Installations with many spindles will see the best results with regards to performance, fast spare activation and replacement. The benefits come with the associated cost of whole stripe at a time allocation for small objects in the pool. This overhead should be calculated in the design of the pool before it’s an operational surprise.</p>



<p>There is no free lunch with dRAID for in saving parity or spare drives, they are your defense against data loss. As drives increase in size, their time to resilver increases and the amount of data they can destroy increases.</p>

The high-level features in Nx are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (<code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>), signed integers (<code>s8</code>, <code>s16</code>, <code>s32</code>, <code>s64</code>), floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) and brain floats (<code>bf16</code>);    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor">Named tensors</a>, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The <code>grad</code> function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Tensors backends, which enables the main <code>Nx</code> API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Numerical definitions, known as <code>defn</code>, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python developers, <code>Nx</code> currently takes its main inspirations from <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>Numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax"><code>JAX</code></a> but packaged into a single unified library.</p>
<p>
Our initial efforts have focused on the underlying abstractions. For example, while Nx implements dense tensors out-of-the-box, we also want the same high-level API to be valid for sparse tensors. You should also be able to use all functions in the <code>Nx</code> module with tensors that are backed by Elixir binaries and with tensors that are stored directly in the GPU.</p>
<p>
By ensuring the underlying tensor backend is ultimately replaceable, we can build an ecosystem of libraries on top of Nx, and allow end-users to experiment with different backends, hardware, and approaches to run their software on.</p>
<p>
<em>Nx’s mascot is the Numbat, a marsupial native to southern Australia. Unfortunately the Numbat are endangered and it is estimated to be fewer than 1000 left. If you are excited about Nx, consider donating to Numbat conservation efforts, such as <a href="https://www.numbat.org.au/">Project Numbat</a> and <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</a>.</em></p>
<h2>
Numerical definitions</h2>
<p>
One of the most important features in <code>Nx</code> is the numerical definition, called <code>defn</code>. Numerical definitions are a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computing. Here is the <code>softmax</code> formula above, now written with <code>defn</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Formula</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4810618200-1">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="4810618200-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4810618200-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The first difference we see with <code>defn</code> is that Elixir’s built-in operators have been augmented to also work with tensors. Effectively, <code>defn</code> replaces Elixir’s <code>Kernel</code> with <code>Nx.Defn.Kernel</code>.</p>
<p>
However, <code>defn</code> goes even further. When using <code>defn</code>, <code>Nx</code> builds a computation with all of your tensor operations. Let’s inspect it:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0860724160-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0860724160-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0860724160-2">do</span><span>

This computation graph can also be transformed programatically. The transformation is precisely how we implement automatic differentiation, also known as <code>autograd</code>, by traversing each node and computing their derivative:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>grad_softmax</span><span data-group-id="5969204985-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5969204985-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5969204985-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="5969204985-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Finally, this computation graph can also be handed out to different compilers. As an example, we have implemented bindings for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/">Google’s XLA</a> compiler, called EXLA. We can ask the <code>softmax</code> function to use this new compiler with a module attribute:</p>
<pre><code><span>@defn_compiler</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5313365207-1">{</span><span>EXLA</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:host</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-1">}</span><span>

  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-6">)</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Once <code>softmax</code> is called, <code>Nx.Defn</code> will invoke <code>EXLA</code> to emit a just-in-time and highly-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the tensor type and shape. By passing <code>client: :cuda</code> or <code>client: :rocm</code>, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values on different clients:</p>

Where <code>keep</code> indicates the tensor was kept on the device instead of being transferred back to Elixir. You can see the benchmark in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/bench"><code>bench</code></a> directory and find some examples in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/examples"><code>examples</code></a> directory of the EXLA project.</p>
<h3>
Compiling numerical definitions</h3>
<p>
Before moving forward, it is important for us to take a look at how numerical definitions are compiled. For example, take the <code>softmax</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5791259392-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-3">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-4">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-5">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-5">)</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-4">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
One might think that Elixir takes the AST of the softmax function above and compiles it directly to the GPU. However, that’s not the case! Numerical definitions are first compiled to Elixir code that will emit the computation graph and this computation graph is then compiled to the GPU. The multiple stages go like this:</p>
<pre><code>Elixir AST
-&gt; compiles to .beam (Erlang VM bytecode)
   -&gt; executes into defn AST
      -&gt; compiles to GPU</code></pre>
<p>
This multi-stage programming is made possible thanks to Elixir macros. For example, when you see a conditional inside <code>defn</code>, that conditional looks exactly like Elixir conditionals, but it will be compiled to an accelerator:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-4">do</span><span>
    </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-4">else</span><span>
    </span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-4">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In a nutshell, <code>defn</code> provides us with a subset of Elixir for numerical computations that can be compiled to specific hardware, such as CPU, GPU, and other accelerators. All of this was possible without making changes or forking the language.</p>
<p>
And while <code>defn</code> is a subset of the language, it is a considerable one. You will find support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Mathematical operators  </li>
  <li>
Pipes (<code>|&gt;</code>), module attributes, the access syntax (i.e. <code>tensor[1][1..-1]</code>), etc  </li>
  <li>
Elixir macros constructs (imports, aliases, etc)  </li>
  <li>
Control-flow with conditionals (both <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code>), loops (coming soon), etc  </li>
  <li>
Transformations, an explicit mechanism to invoke Elixir code from a <code>defn</code> (which enables constructs such as <code>grad</code>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And more coming down the road.</p>
<h2>
Why functional programming?</h2>
<p>
At this point, you may be wondering: is functional programming a good fit for numerical computing? One of the main concerns is that immutability can be expensive when working with large blobs of memory. And that’s a valid concern! In fact, when using the default tensor backend, tensors will be backed by Elixir binaries which are copied on every operation. That’s why it was critical for us to design <code>Nx</code> with pluggable backends from day one.</p>
<p>
However, as we move to higher-level abstractions, such as numerical definitions, we will start to reap the benefits of functional programming.</p>
<p>
For example, in order to build computation graphs, immutability becomes an indispensable tool both in terms of implementation and in terms of reasoning. The JAX library for Python, which has been one of the guiding lights for Nx design, also promotes functional and immutable principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>JAX is intended to be used with a functional style of programming</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.ops.html?highlight=functional#indexed-update-operators">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>Unlike NumPy arrays, JAX arrays are always immutable</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html?highlight=immutable#JAX-vs.-NumPy">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, frameworks like <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc.ai</a> argue that functional programming can provide better abstractions and more composable building blocks for deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>
We hope that, by exploring these ideas in a language that is functional by design, Elixir can bring new ideas and insights at the higher-level.</p>

  </p></div>

  <p>Hi, Alexey is here. I have some exciting news for you!</p>
<p>I rewrote <a href="https://moiva.io/">Moiva.io</a> from scratch and made it a Universal and Flexible tool to suit a taste of every software developer be they a JavaScript, Python or [put your favorite language here] developer.</p>
<p>This article marks a third major release of Moiva.</p>
<p><img src="https://moiva.io/blog/images/universal-tool/full.png" alt="A screenshot of Moiva.io showing comparison of Vue and Svelte npm packages"></p>
<h2 id="whats-new-in-short">What’s new (in short)</h2>
<ul>
<li>ability to search for and get data for any GitHub repository in addition to search and comparison of NPM packages.</li>
<li>possibility to bring (relatively easy) Search, Suggestion, and Comparison capabilities to other programming languages' package management systems like <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/">Maven</a> (Java), <a href="https://pypi.org/">PIP</a> (Python), or <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist</a> (PHP).</li>
<li>last but not least, Moiva got <a href="https://github.com/aantipov/moiva">open-sourced</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-i-did-it">Why I did it</h2>
<p>At first, I wanted to focus on JavaScript ecosystem, making npm packages first-class citizens in Moiva.io.</p>
<p>The goal was to provide developers with a good tool to evaluate and compare npm packages in different dimensions - Popularity, Maintenance, Security, etc.</p>
<p>But very soon I realized that there are many JavaScript-related projects which don’t have any published npm packages.</p>
<p>Think of, for example, frameworks like <code>Meteor</code>.</p>
<p>Moiva.io could potentially be useful for the evaluation of those projects as well thanks to GitHub charts (Contributors, Issues, Commits Frequency, etc.), but search functionality was limited to npm packages only and everything was built around the concept of npm packages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Moiva gets opened up to the search, evaluation and comparison of <strong>any</strong> GitHub project, it will essentially convert Moiva into a universal tool and make it useful to many more developers.</p>
<p>So I got convinced that Moiva should become more Universal and Agile, I just need to come up with a good harmonious concept of how it should look, work and how to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="aha-moment">AHA moment</h2>
<p>In the beginning, the idea of supporting GitHub looked vague and blurred. I didn’t have any good idea how to put together existing functionality for npm packages and the new one for GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>I could implement separate pages for npm and GitHub, but that was not ideal. Both have a lot in common when comparing JavaScript projects.</p>
<p>Then the <code>AHA</code> moment came - everything became clear, I realized how to put together different things and since then I was unstoppable.</p>
<p>Here is the essence of the solution.</p>
<h3 id="one-search-for-all">One Search for All</h3>
<p>The same single search field can be used to search for both npm packages and GitHub repositories. It can be easily achieved via search modifiers (prefixes).</p>
<p>The default search is for GitHub.</p>
<p>The search prefixed with <code>n:</code> is for npm packages.</p>
<p><img src="https://moiva.io/blog/images/universal-tool/search.gif" alt="A gif showing how Search field at Moiva.io works: search for NPM packages and GitHub repositories"></p>
<p>What I like about that solution is that it can be easily extended in the future to search for other things as well.</p>
<h3 id="show-only-relevant-charts">Show only relevant charts</h3>
<p>If a user selects only GitHub repositories without related npm packages, then we can just hide npm-related charts. No reason to show them.</p>
<p>It’s similar to how ThoughtWorks TechRadar and Developer Usage charts work - they are shown only when there is data for the selected npm packages.</p>
<p>At the same time, if the user selects a mix of npm and Github projects, we will show npm-related charts for the selected npm packages.</p>
<h3 id="how-about-urls">How about URLs</h3>
<p>Every comparison a user makes in Moiva should be easily reproducible via URL.</p>
<p>It means that Moiva should be able to derive from the URL what information to load, what to put into comparison.</p>
<p>When npm packages were the only citizens in the Moiva world, the task was solved easily - the selected npm packages' names were listed in a query parameter: <code>https://moiva.io/?compare=react+svelte+vue</code>.</p>
<p>Having 2 types of citizens, npm and Github, where one depends on the other, complicates things a bit. Moreover, we want to build a future-proof solution that can incorporate other types of citizens like PIP and Maven.</p>
<p>GitHub has a broader scope than npm and my first idea was to replace URL npm identifiers with GitHub identifiers. But there are 2 problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s not clear how to derive the npm package from the GitHub repository. At least I couldn’t find the solution for that.</li>
<li>one GitHub repo can be a source of multiple npm packages. There is no 1:1 connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>It lead me to the conclusion that GitHub and npm should be referenced separately in the URL.</p>
<p>So I just decided to have separate query parameters: <code>https://moiva.io/?npm=svelte+vue&amp;github=meteor/meteor</code>.</p>
<h3 id="github-and-npm-reconciliation">GitHub and NPM reconciliation</h3>
<p>Imagine two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>a user selects Vue as an npm package.</li>
<li>a user selects Vue as a GitHub repo.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first situation Moiva shows npm-related data and charts like npm Downloads. In the second situation, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>But is it fair? Most probably a user would expect to see the same set of information in both cases, right?</p>
<p>Could we still somehow derive information about the npm package from the GitHub repository? If yes, then we could show npm data for the selected GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Turns out we can make use of <a href="https://github.com/aantipov/moiva-catalog">Moiva Catalog</a> which was built to implement the Suggestions mechanism.
For every listed GitHub repository we can add a name of the npm package if there is one. It means we can solve the problem of the reconciliation for items listed in the catalog. And I think it’s a good enough solution with which we can cover the most popular libraries.</p>
<p>We just need to take care of some details and edge cases.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a repository does have an npm package, but that package is just one of the repo’s “by-products”, then probably it doesn’t make sense to show that npm package data when selecting the repository. To solve that problem, an additional flag <code>isNpmCoreArtifact</code> in the catalog can be used to indicate the “role” of the npm package.</li>
<li>If we successfully derive npm data from the GitHub repository, it means we essentially display the same information for both npm and GitHub and have different URL identifiers for the same page. It’s not good, especially in terms of SEO. So I decided to use npm package’s name as a URL identifier in such cases. Try load <code>https://moiva.io/?github=vuejs/vue</code> url and see what happens ;=)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data-model">Data model</h3>
<p>I mentioned just a few of the problems I had to solve. There were, of course, many others, like duplication handling, aliases, SEO, etc.</p>
<p>Most of the problems got a straightforward solution once I implemented a proper Data Model - I came up with a new abstraction called “Library” and provided it with certain properties and behavior.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/aantipov/moiva/">repository’s readme</a> for more details about the Library concept.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>I clearly see a huge potential for <a href="https://moiva.io/">Moiva.io</a> to become a really useful tool to many developers.</p>
<p>It can grow and become better in different directions.
I will mention a few of them which look most important to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable search/suggestion/comparison for more languages' package systems (Maven, PIP, etc.).</li>
<li>add more useful charts and data, both generic and language/package-system specific.</li>
<li>improve significantly the alternatives suggestion system. Currently, it’s based on <a href="https://github.com/aantipov/moiva-catalog">Moiva Catalog</a> and needs a lot of data to be put there. I see a way how the community could help and contribute there.</li>
</ul>

			<p><span>C</span>arl Hart is a neuroscientist and Ziff Professor of Psychology at Columbia University—he was the first tenured African-American professor of sciences at Columbia. His research focuses on the “behavioral and neuropharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs in humans.” Hart’s new book, <i>Drug Use For Grown-Ups</i>, is a bold and engaging effort to counter what he sees as generations of misinformation and moral grandstanding about drug use. Today’s “sensationalistic media coverage of the opioid crisis continues a long, awful tradition of exploiting ignorance and fear to vilify certain members of our society,” Hart writes. The media is not the only problem. Scientists, he states, “have frequently overinterpreted and distorted” drugs’ effects on the brain.</p><p>Hart reports that more than 70 percent of drug users—whether they use alcohol, cocaine, prescription medications, or heroin—do not meet the health criteria for drug addiction. In <i>Drug Use for Grown-Ups</i>, Hart strives to “present a more realistic image of the typical drug user: a responsible professional who happens to use drugs in his pursuit of happiness.” With genial candor, Hart presents himself as a model drug user. “I am now entering my fifth year as a regular heroin user,” he writes. “I do not have a drug-use problem. Never have. Each day, I meet my parental, personal, and professional responsibilities. I pay my taxes, serve as a volunteer in my community on a regular basis, and contribute to the global community as an informed and engaged citizen. I am better for my drug use.”</p><p><i>Nautilus</i> caught up with Hart to discuss his drug use and his sharp points about science and society. He was as casually bold in conversation as he is in <i>Drug Use for Grown-Ups</i>.</p><figure data-alt="MacNamara_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18174_0f004440ba0c8f1ccc5c355f3d77207f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>HABIT OF A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PERSON:</strong> “My heroin use is as rational as my alcohol use,” Carl Hart writes. “Like vacation, sex, and the arts, heroin is one of the tools that I use to maintain my work-life balance.”</span><span>Courtesy of Carl Hart</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>You say “most drug-use scenarios cause little or no harm and that some responsible drug-use scenarios are actually beneficial for human health and functioning.” How so?</b></p><p>Let’s just talk about alcohol first. When you’re at a wedding reception, alcohol serves as a social lubricant. People are more gregarious. They talk, they interact. The same is true with cocaine at parties, heroin among friends, or opium among friends, NDMA among lovers. It enhances empathy, openness, and forgiveness, all of these pro-social attributes.</p><p><b>Drug research, you write, is full of bad science. If you had to name one example, what would it be?</b></p><p>The notion that drug addiction is a brain disease. That encapsulates all that’s wrong with today’s science in this area. There is absolutely no data in humans to show that drug addiction is a brain disease. Yet the narrative, the dogma, the dominant perspective is that it does. Even though nobody will dispute that, there’s absolutely no data in humans to support that statement.</p><p><b>Yet opioids do change the brain biologically, do they not?</b></p><p>Yes, opioids bind to a class of receptors called endogenous opioids, which you find in endorphins, for example. Opioids bind to these receptors—just like natural chemicals do—which results in a response. In some cases, because of decreased sensitivities and certain types of pain, they may enhance a sense of euphoria. So it’s really just facilitating what’s already in the body naturally, a system that helps in our survival. Think of fructose or glucose. We add sugar to our tea, our coffee, whatever we have, we add more and more because we like it, it tastes good, and it enhances pleasure. It can give you energy. It can make life more interesting. Humans do not live on logic alone. And so sometimes we do these things, and that’s OK.</p><blockquote><p>People become addicted because they once had a middle-class-paying job that made them someone in their community.</p> </blockquote><p><b>How have scientists “overinterpreted and distorted” the effects of drugs on the brain?</b><br></p><p>Take brain imaging. People often show one image of someone’s brain. Let’s say this person is addicted to methamphetamine, according to DSM criteria, versus the brain of someone who’s not addicted. If you see some difference, some researchers have a propensity to make more out of the differences than are there. There’s a wide range of brain structural sizes, such that when we think about one person’s size of their nucleus accumbens, it may be smaller or larger than somebody else’s nucleus accumbens. But both of the nucleus accumbens, despite their sizes, are within the normal range of human variability. It’s like height. One guy might be 5’10”, another guy might be 6’2”. But we don’t say the guy who’s 5’10” is height deficient. We just say that he’s in a normal range, and he’s not as tall as the other guy. We wouldn’t say one is deficient versus the other. In neuroscience, one of the things that has happened, particularly when it comes to drugs, people have over-interpreted the differences to mean pathology, when, in fact, both of the brain structures are within the normal range of human variability. The overinterpretation is to interpret it as being pathological.</p><p><b>You say the opioid crisis has been sensationalized, and write, “People are not dying because of opioids; they are dying because of ignorance.” What do you mean?</b></p><p>Some people don’t know not to mix specific sedatives with opioids. For example, they don’t know not to mix large amounts of alcohol or large amounts of antihistamines. Specific combinations can lead to respiratory depression, which can lead to death. Another point of ignorance involves people who buy street drugs and don’t necessarily know if the drugs contain contaminants. That’s the kind of ignorance I’m talking about.</p><div>

</div><p><b>So it’s the mix of drugs that is the problem, not opioids like heroin themselves?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes, the majority of opioid deaths occur as a result of combining opioids with multiple sedatives. But there are certain opioids that do concern us if taken alone and the person isn’t aware that they have this particular opioid. Those are fentanyl and the fentanyl analogs. These drugs are a lot more potent than something like heroin, meaning they require less of it to produce the effect. Most of the public aren’t seeking fentanyl or its analogs, but people are tainting things like heroin and oxycodone pills with fentanyl or an analog.</p><p>One way to deal with this tainting, this contamination, is to have free drug-checking facilities, where people can submit samples of their drug and get a chemical readout of what is contained in the substance. That way they’ll know whether to take the substance or how much of it to take. The public also needs to know that most people who use these drugs are not addicts. If you understand that, then you know that for the people who do become addicted, we have to look beyond the drug and look at the person’s environment, their life. Do they have co-occurring psychiatric illnesses? Do they have pain that is not treated? All of these kinds of issues become important.</p><p><b>At what point does biological change in the brain lead to physical addiction?</b></p><p>Physical addiction occurs as a result of opioids—or any other drug, alcohol too—being in the body for consecutive weeks or periods, in particularly high doses. And then the body tries to compensate. For example, with opioids, one of the things that happens is that your gut, your gastrointestinal system, slows down the receptors. Your body is trying to compensate by speeding up the gastrointestinal tract. So when the drug abruptly leaves after several weeks of constant administration of the opioid, now the body is unprepared for the drug not being there and it overcompensates. It really ramps up the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, which causes diarrhea, among other things.</p><blockquote><p>It can give you energy. It can make life more interesting. Humans do not live on logic alone.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Why do some people get addicted and not others?</b><br></p><p>The amount of drugs they take, the period at which they take it. Some people can take opioids for extended periods of time. As long as they keep the doses fairly low and they don’t take multiple doses a day, they probably won’t experience physical dependence. It’s just like with alcohol. Most people drink alcohol on a regular basis, but they don’t become physically dependent. Whereas others drink every day in large amounts, and they will become physically dependent.</p><p><b>Why can’t people overcome addiction?</b></p><p>One of the major reasons people can’t overcome it is because we’re not very good at treating addiction in this country. Just think about why people become addicted. A large number become addicted because of co-occurring psychiatric illnesses, because of pain issues, because they once had a middle-class-paying job that made them someone in their home, someone in their community. Those jobs are gone. Then there’s no healthcare or there’s poor education. If your treatment is not addressing these issues, people are not going to overcome it. But if we have treatments that are holistic, and they’re looking at the individual, and not so much the drug, then we’re good. But if we’re just talking about the drug, then we’re already behind the eight ball, then we will lose that battle.</p><p><b>Your definition of addiction follows the DSM-5, which refers to a “substance use disorder” and values functioning over regular ingestion of a substance. How do you define “functioning”?</b></p><p>Functioning is determined by whether a user is happy in meeting their obligations, whatever they may be, whether they’re work-related, whether they’re family-related, or other social sorts of things. The person is not stressed out about their substance use. In fact, …</p></div></div>

is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of
locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least
energy to move a kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive
showing about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a
showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.</p><p>But then, somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the
efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a
human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the
charts.</p><p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the
most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.</p><p>It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=322">Steve Jobs (1980)</a></p></blockquote><p>* * *</p><p><a href="https://www.it-hiroshima.ac.jp/institution/library/pdf/research52%5F007-013.pdf">No one knows</a> when or how we, the human species, started talking to each
other. It is likely a natural progression from gesturing, but we can only
speculate about it.</p><p>Language allowed us to break out of our brains and reveal the inner
workings of our consciousness to others.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/language_speech.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Scott H. Young"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2018/12/04/25-thinking-tools/">Scott H. Young</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Language is the vessel that carried us from the stone age through the
agricultural revolution, the development of written language, the
scientific and industrial revolutions, and now, the digital age.</p><p>Writing allowed us to <em>offload</em> memories to the physical world—outside of
our brains. Through our collective and external memories, each generation
has a head start on the previous one. Little by little, standing on the
shoulders of taller and taller giants, we accumulate knowledge about
ourselves and everything around us.</p><p>We’ve been for long using tools to help us think: notebooks help us
calculate formulas, reason geometrically and preserve our ideas. With
computers, our <em>thinking</em> is now occurring outside of our brains.</p><p>Computers are extensions of our minds in that they allow us to store,
process, and retrieve information from them. With the advent of the
internet we now have immediate access to not only almost all of the
information ever produced by humankind but also to reproducible <em>thinking</em>
encoded into these machines: algorithms.</p><p>Our brain is still a much more impressive device than any of today's
computers. Computers learn
<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nfsp-1.pdf">mostly</a>
by finding patterns in massive
quantities of examples given by us. Teaching a young kid about cars—how
to recognize one, what they are, what their purpose is, and how they're
related to other things—requires little supervision. Noam Chomsky talks
about it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdUbIlwHRkY&amp;t=1462">this interview</a>.</p><p>Each of these processes—storing, processing and retrieving
information—have concrete effects on the physical world: if I’m in
Munich, saying “show route to Hamburg” to my phone will immediately show me
the distance, ETAs and paths for different types of transport to reach my
destination. Not only do I now suddenly know how to navigate across the
country to reach another city, I’m also able to follow through the exact
path via GPS—a sixth sense giving me perfect geolocation!</p><p>These <em>things</em> that we created—computers, and the internet—are literally
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/">rewiring our brains</a>, right now, shaping how we think, and engage in social
relationships, changing not only our individual selves but the societies we
live in.</p><p>They started as mechanical machines that filled entire laboratories, turned
into beige boxes in our homes and places of work, and are now sleek slabs
of plastic, metal and glass in everyone’s pockets. Step by step they get
closer to our bodies, their interfaces more intuitive and natural.</p><p>The way we communicate with them is changing: before, we could only
interact with them by speaking their language. We have now taught them
ours. The torch of progress blazes on: it’s a matter of <em>time</em> until they’re
connected directly with our brains—which is equally terrifying and
awe-inspiring.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/neuralink.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Neuralink"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Brain-computer interfaces present a monumental scientific and engineering
challenge, and brain-to-brain, a whole other category of difficulty.</p><p>First, we have no idea how information is encoded in the brain. That needs
to be understood. Second, even assuming we’re able to take a perfect
snapshot of a piece of information in someone’s brain—for example, how a
particular movie scene makes them feel—we still need to be able to encode
it in a way that includes the full context of their subjective experiences.
Maybe the scene evokes unique memories of their childhood or is somehow
entangled with the smell of a particular cinema’s leather seats. Third, we
need to figure out how to safely write this perfect snapshot into someone
else’s brain in a way that can be perceived identically.</p><p>Which is to say, it’s a difficult problem. But a worthwhile one: imagine
having the capability to suddenly become aware of answers for questions you
just thought about. To expertly control <a href="https://youtu.be/PLk8Pm%5FXBJE?t=13">truly integrated</a> prosthetics giving
you superhuman abilities. To give movement to the paralized, sound to the
deaf, and sight to the blind.</p><p>What would be the impacts on society if we were able to communicate an
order of magnitude more effectively? What if <em>everyone</em> was equipped with
the same undisputed basic knowledge of history and science?</p><p>There are internal thoughts that we can attempt to describe with a thousand
words, but ultimately fail to capture in a way that’s precise, much less
comprehensible by someone else. Words and sentences are an incomplete
representation of our internal thoughts. In the same way that 3D objects
cast 2D shadows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM">and 4D, 3D</a>) communicating through language doesn’t carry
all of our cultural and developmental context—transmitting all of that
along with every phrase would be impractical. Language is in this sense,
lossily compressed thought.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tesseract_shadow.jpg"></figure><p>Inert strings of words of ink and paper take a life of their own inside our
heads. It’s why the exact same information can be interpreted completely
differently by different people.</p><p>Before language, fire and cooking technology allowed us to reallocate
energy usage from the digestive system to the brain by outsourcing
digestion to outside of our bodies, making macronutrients more efficiently
absorbable. Almost all of a cooked meal is metabolized by the body, whereas
raw foods yield less than half of their nutrients.</p><p>Cooking is an extension of our digestive system, and enabled us to develop
large, calorie-hungry brains. It also gave us time to think: our primate
cousins spend half of their days chewing raw food to consume enough
calories to stay alive.</p><p>Brains can be seen as <em>survival machines</em>, locked inside dark skulls,
constantly building a model of the outside world by predicting and learning
through senses and memory. The biological human brain evolved to have the
necessary sophistication to not only expertly navigate and understand the
brute physical reality but also to construct <em>social</em> reality. Democracy,
religion, money: all made up by us, for us.</p><p>We remember the past so that we can predict the future, and by doing so, we
thrive.</p><p>We create technology, which functions as a non-biological extra layer to
our brains and bodies, augmenting, complementing, and sometimes replacing
our natural capabilities.</p><blockquote><p>The wheel… is an extension of the foot.</p><p>The book… is an extension of the eye…</p><p>Clothing, an extension of the skin…</p><p>Electric circuitry, an extension of the central nervous system.</p><p>—
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding_Media">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1964)</a></p></blockquote><p>Relatively speaking, we are done evolving <em>biologically</em>. Further adaptations
and enhancements to our bodies and minds will come through technology.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/brain_layers.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Check out &amp;ldquo;Neuralink and the Brain&amp;rsquo;s Magical Future&amp;rdquo; for a very entertaining primer on the brain."><figcaption><p>Figure 5: Check out “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future</a>” for a very entertaining primer on the brain.</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be human is to have the ability to change the world around us. The shift
from hunting and gathering to farming allowed us to spend less energy to
acquire food while giving us a predictable calorie supply.</p><p>The resulting food surplus made it possible for populations to settle down
and grow quickly while supporting people not being directly involved in the
production of food—before agriculture that was everyone’s job. For one,
it allowed some to specialize and focus on developing better farming tools
and more resistant crops, starting a vicious cycle of improvement and
consumption that continues until today.</p><p>The transition from active foraging to a more sedentary lifestyle resulted
in worse health for the general population. The average farmer worked
harder than the average forager and got a worse diet in return. Our teeth,
bones and joints became more fragile, and we became afflicted by novel
diseases coming from newly domesticated animals, carriers of pathogens that
incubated in our new densely populated cities.</p><p>Owning land suddenly became really important. Agriculture and the concept
of private property reinforced each other and grew together, allowing us to
create value and secure the fruits of our labor. It also created the
circumstances for slavery to arise, and wars to be waged.</p><p>The groups of people growing the first crops could not have anticipated all
of the collateral effects of their breakthrough. They just wanted more
food.</p><p>If the past has taught us anything is that we have to be mindful of the
consequences of our progress. In an increasingly connected world, change is
often <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/05/linear-thinking-in-a-nonlinear-world">nonlinear</a> and unpredictable. Cars didn’t just replace horses—they
forever changed the entire outlook of every city. Did Tim Berners-Lee
anticipate his invention adding to forces pulling whole countries apart?</p><p>Our progress will continue to bring us previously unimaginable challenges.
Against an unknowable future, it doesn’t hurt to keep improving our
capabilities to adapt and, more difficultly, to cooperate—especially at
scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/humanity.jpg" alt="Figure 6: &amp;ldquo;Humanity&amp;rdquo; by Pawel Kuczynski"><figcaption><p>Figure 6: “<a href="https://www.pictorem.com/24592/humanity.html">Humanity</a>” by Pawel Kuczynski</p></figcaption></figure><p>Computers are getting pretty good at driving cars—even in the most

    I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html?full=true">this
article</a> which presents the hypothesis that the universe is a 3D projection of a 2D
surface, like a giant hologram. I like to read about modern physics. It is so weird and I can't say
I really understand very much of it. But the descriptions provoke strange and fascinating images
and thoughts in my head. Like this one:</p><p>The article mentions the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length">Planck length</a>, which as I understand it is
the smallest distance there is. It's extremely small: 1.6 × 10<sup>-35</sup> meters, which makes
it billions and billions of times smaller than an atom (or even a proton). I'm used to thinking
about computer graphics, so I imagine the Planck length as the size of one "pixel" of the universe.
Nothing can be smaller than a pixel. (The pixels of the universe are small, I calculate the
resolution to correspond to 2.19 × 10<sup>33</sup> DPI.) The radius of the observable universe is
4.4 × 10<sup>26</sup> meters. If we want to fit the universe into a box, its sides would have to
be twice that size. That is 5.4 × 10<sup>61</sup> Planck lengths. So that's the width, height and
depth of the universe in pixels. Quite a good resolution. (Actually since they are 3D cubes instead
of 2D squares, I should call them voxels instead of pixels. All 1.61 × 10<sup>185</sup> of
them.)</p><p>There is also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time">Planck time</a>
which is the time it takes for light to travel one Planck length. As light is fast and the Planck
length is tiny (tiniest there is!), you can image that it's a very short period of time. Certainly.
The Planck time is 5.39 × 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds. No measurable time can be shorter than that
according to quantum physics. Thinking about graphics again, this is like a limit on the frame rate
of the universe. Inverting the Planck time, I get 1.855 × 10<sup>43</sup>. So by my surely
incorrect logic, we get the value of the universe's frame rate:</p><p>One thousand eight hundred
and fifty-five billion billion billion billion frames per second.</p><p>I'll say that
again:</p><p>18.55 septillion FPS!</p><p>Video cameras won't be perfect until they can record at
that speed.</p><p>I hope I got the calculations right, but I'm pretty sure my interpretation of the
quantum physics behind this are way off. It's still fascinating to think of the universe as a
computer simulation. Modern physics make it seem more like a video game than ever.<br>

            <p>Lithuania’s Interior Ministry plans to hold drills and assess the need to evacuate Vilnius’ residents in case of an accident at the Astravyets nuclear plant in Belarus, located some 50 kilometres from the Lithuanian capital.</p>
            
            <p>"That will be one of the key questions during the drafting of the exercises schedule and probably going back to the scenarios: do we or do we not need to evacuate Vilnius residents,” Vitalij Dmitrijev, vice minister of the interior, told LRT RADIO.</p>
            <p>The so-called Astravyets drill was held in October 2019 in Vilnius and Svenčionys districts, which are located close to the Belarusian border. During the exercises, authorities prepared to evacuate people from radiation-affected territories, distribute iodine pills, as well as simulated a resident cleanup and monitoring operation.</p>
            <p>The exercise involved around 300 officers, troops and civil servants from six municipalities and 24 institutions. Due to a dispute over the exercise scenario with the Vilnius authorities, officers from the capital did not take part in the drills.</p>

            <!--googleoff: all--><!--googleon: all-->            <p>Previously, the Vilnius authorities cancelled another exercise, planned in early September, to simulate an accident at the nuclear power plant in Belarus.</p>
            <p>Based on the information available to BNS, Vilnius Municipality faced resistance from the government at the time.</p>
            <p>Lithuanian officials say that the nuclear power plant built by the Russian state atomic corporation Rosatom and funded by a loan from the Kremlin was built in breach of international safety standards. Minsk denies all accusations.</p>
            <p>Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are also due to unplug from the Moscow-controlled energy grid that links them with Belarus. Vilnius says that the Kremlin may use the plant to derail the move.</p>

  <p>In this post I’m gonna be making all kinds of fun of <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>.
And all that after spending just a few hours poking around it.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to write in the layout of the good, the bad, and the ugly,
but I’m not entirely sure how that would pan out.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Before I begin, I’ll somewhat oversimplify and explain Urbit to those of you not
in the know.</p>
<p><em>And before I do that, here’s a PSA: there’s a <a href="#tldr">tl;dr at the end</a>. So you
don’t need to read all this drivel. You’re welcome.</em></p>
<h2 id="urwhat">Ur…what?</h2>
<p>According to its own webpage, Urbit is an “overlay OS” and network for the 21st
century.</p>
<p>What that means at the time of writing<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> is that it’s a single-threaded
interpreter running as a unix process that speaks udp protocol to a meshed
network (and http to your browser).</p>
<p>And all of that in the name of delivering you flaky, unreliable, and feature-poor
implementation of an internet forum. (in a nutshell)<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>An additional component of Urbit is its “distributed” identity component, where
your identity is uniquely tied to a 32-bit integer. And to go with the zeitgeist,
it’s backed by Ethereum blockchain. Naturally.</p>
<p>All we need is quantum computing and ML, and we have all the latest buzzwords.
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/g/dev/c/a6hdQdzIgqo">Oh, wait.</a></p>
<p>But to better explain what’s going on, let’s look at…</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history</h2>
<p>I’m going to take Urbit’s history page on authority here.</p>
<p>This project started in 2002 as a PhD thesis to reinvent computing. Over the
next 6 years the progress was a language specification (Nock) for
a turing-complete language with ~11 instructions.</p>
<p>Then, over 10+ years other people ran with it, took it further, and implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>(more than one) VM interpreting that language</li>
<li>a higher level language – Hoon (to make Nock “practical”)</li>
<li>an encrypted mesh protocol</li>
<li>a versioned control system</li>
<li>an application layer</li>
<li>a web frontend (several apps, actually)</li>
<li>an identity layer</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>If this smells like a bad case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH</a>,
it’s probably because that’s exactly the case.</p>
<h2 id="urbit-as-an-ideal-good-and-insane-at-the-same-time">Urbit as an ideal: good and insane at the same time</h2>
<p>But let’s talk about Urbit as an ideal for a moment.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that when <a href="https://youtu.be/M04AKTCDavc">the marketing materials</a>
speak of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>defining an operating system on a single piece of paper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>throwing away every line of code from the 1970s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they mean well. Given some sort of hardware implementation of Nock (the low level
language) you theoretically <em>could</em> throw away everything and start from scratch.</p>
<p>And it would be all kinds of awesome, if you could have decent control over your
personal computing without all the cruft accumulated since ’70s.</p>
<p>Only… with Urbit this ideal would be so slow as to be useless. See, Nock has
one arithmetic operation, increment (<code>x+1</code>). So if you want to decrement <code>x</code>,
you have to loop from <code>0</code> to <code>x-1</code>. Or you can break your promise of throwing
away all the code from ’70s… and implement decrement in C.</p>
<p>And the same story (of replacing godawfully ineffective implementation of native
code with C implementation) goes pretty much for any reasonable functionality you
might expect. Crypto? Sorting? Basic math and string ops? All of it.</p>
<p>The entire frickin’ peer to peer protocol is written in C, too. So are vast
swaths of the OS: db, ames, http, terminal, database, event processing, …</p>
<p>Is it possible to truly throw away every line of code from the 1970s up until
now… and start from clean slate? Hell yeah. Only, probably not with Nock.</p>
<p>So we have the pivot to “overlay OS” (mentioned on urbit.org), in other words:
<strong>let’s not throw away any lines of code, but instead build on top of them</strong>.
And then access the UI using a conventional browser over http, that will
interpret the React-based javascript (among other things).</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>Ubit’s core promise:reality – 0:1.</p>
<h2 id="hoon-as-a-language-amazing">Hoon as a language: amazing</h2>
<p>Let’s move on to the Hoon language<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>, the workhose of the platform.</p>
<p>Once you start diggin in, you will be constantly met with such <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/pkg/arvo/gen/cat.hoon">vomit inducing
beauty</a>:</p>
<pre><code>::  ConCATenate file listings

  [leaf+(spud pax) (pretty-file .^(noun (cat 3 vane %x) pax))]
?-     dir.ark                                          ::  handle ambiguity
    ~

  :~  rose+[" " `~]^~[leaf+"*" (smyt pax)]
      `tank`(show-dir vane pax dir.ark)
  ==
==
</code></pre>
<p>that makes Perl the world champion of readable languages by comparison.</p>
<p>I’m not being entirely fair here, because I’m sure you can memorize the digraphs
in a few weeks<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>, and eventually you get the hang of writing this.
But in the grand scheme of things… why the heck would you want to?!</p>
<p>It is hard enough to write bug free code in a language that you can find
tens of thousands of top notch coders for (that would give you an honest
code review). It’s quite another thing doing basic reading of Hoon.</p>
<p>But let’s say I’m biased, this is the future, and 5 years down the road it
will be the gold standard for personal computing dev<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>What can you expect in terms of features, then?</p>
<p>Well, since you’re essentially supposed to run on top of Nock, and it’s
all supposed to be strictly deterministic on top of an event stream, my
imagination is failing me as to how it’s going to support some sort of
parallel processing, because you probably don’t want to be stuck humping
one core of your CPU.</p>
<p>Let’s say you try to make it work in parallel using message passing.
Hmm, there goes determinism.</p>
<p>Or shared memory? There goes using “Nock” (as you’re poking yet another
hole in the substrate).</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a solution, but I’d bet you a doughnut it’s not going
to be as pure as the marketing.</p>
<p>Hoon:reality – draw (it works, but sigh)</p>
<h2 id="urbit-as-an-os--capable">Urbit as an OS – capable?</h2>
<p>Do you remember how we were supposed to throw away all that code from ’70s?</p>
<p>So that’s not happening (as described above).</p>
<p>But at least the OS is a shiny awesome thing capable of real tasks, yes?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Given my short exposure to Urbit I’m sure I’m missing some dark corners
where clumps of awesome lurk, but if you expect more than a Weather app,
half-assed web forum, simple shared notebooks, and a weird ass terminal,
you will be sorely disappointed.</p>
<p>Again, this will be rectified in the future (of that I’m actually and
honestly sure).</p>
<p>There are already some third party Hoon implementations of bit torrent,
chat bots, etc.</p>
<p>And there’s some plans for bitcoin integration, 3rd party apps, etc.</p>
<p>So if the ecosystem takes off, it could be rich and wondrous.</p>
<p>Except… most of it won’t be written in Hoon or Nock. Since Urbitians
are hard at work providing language bindings for well known languages.</p>
<p>So what are you gaining by using Urbit that you couldn’t get elsewhere?
No, seriously… I have yet to figure this one out.</p>
<p>Let’s move on…</p>
<h2 id="hosted-urbit--only-if-you-want-to-wash-your-dirty-laundry-in-public">Hosted Urbit – only if you want to wash your dirty laundry in public</h2>
<p>Now, let’s think about hosting Urbit for just a moment.</p>
<p>You can run it on your Raspberry (and it will work). You even own your
data that way. <em>(duh? don’t you always, in that case?)</em></p>
<p>But let’s suppose you want to host it elsewhere. I mean, there’s this
awesome peer-to-peer encrypted protocol in Urbit, so it’s secure, right?</p>
<p>Well, there’s encryption during transit, and then there’s encryption at
rest.</p>
<p>And the failboat comes in the latter case.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing in Urbit is encrypted at rest</strong>.</p>
<p>No, seriously, all the chat logs, events, everything… is dumped into
a journal on disk<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> in cleartext form.</p>
<p>So, hey, also the whole “a vault for secrets” from the marketing video?
Hmm… are you going to risk it?</p>
<p>And are you going to risk storing your bitcoin wallet on Urbit,
unencrypted?</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>when hosting urbit at any 3rd party, you better be the
only one with access to the underlying OS</strong> (and have it fully encrypted),
lest you want your entire history worth of data readable by the company
running the instance for you. Or anyone with access to the system.</p>
<p>So, running this on GCP? Digital Ocean? Tlon’s hosting? Only if you’re
comfortable [potentially] washing your dirty laundry in public.</p>
<p>Urbit:real world – 0:1</p>
<h2 id="lets-fail-together-over-the-air">Let’s fail together over the air</h2>
<p>So say you run your Urbit securely on your Pi, you love the platform,
the UI, the whole shebang.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Nothing to fear then?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe except the teeny tiny detail that if you want to stay up
to date, you need to configure OTA<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So you will be receiving updates to your Urbit instance from one of your
neighbors (one that you configure).</p>
<p>And you talk to your neighbors over an end to end encrypted channel.</p>
<p>Sounds great, since this is 2021, and surely the updates are signed.</p>
<p>Well, no. They are not. The transmission is, though. Big help!</p>
<p>So – I guess it wouldn’t be that hard for one rotten apple somewhere
on higher ranks of the network<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> <em>(rogue operator, hacked machine, hacked
core dev’s machine)</em> to push a code update that exfiltrates all your data,
possibly including all your secrets (hey, remember the BTC integration)?</p>
<p>And imagine the fun of auditing Hoon for potential security holes in
an update, if you were paranoid. Just the thought is hilarious.</p>
<p>Urbit:security – 0:1</p>
<h2 id="urbit-id--scarcity-creates-value-and-you-pay-a-premium-for-that">Urbit ID – scarcity creates value, and you pay a premium for that</h2>
<p>So I watch in great amazement the booming ecosystem of cryptocurrencies
of different shapes and colors, and of all things blockchain.</p>
<p>Urbit ID is even better than all of them, though.</p>
<p>You see, the entire identity address space is artificially constrained
to 32bit integers<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And according to the Urbit promoters and backers, <em>scarcity creates value</em>.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>No need for demand or anything. It’s scarce, hence it has value. Done<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The fact that a desperate enough person could do an equivalent of a hard
fork, and run it independently with a different Identity root is…
impossible?</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>But anyway, let’s say you …</p></div></div></div>

February 17, 2021 | https://alistairb.dev/reflections-on-haskell-for-startup/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alistairb.dev/reflections-on-haskell-for-startup/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Almost exactly one year ago I quit my job to create a Haskell startup as a solo developer. I had about 20 ideas, but eventually settled on the idea of dependency project health tracking with <a href="https://deadpendency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadpendency</a>.</p>

<p>This post describes the experience and evaluates Haskell and its ecosystem.</p>

<p><small>Disclaimer: This blog post contains a bunch of memes. They are trying to be humorous, not accurate or fair 😉.</small></p>

<h2 id="why-haskell">Why Haskell?</h2>

<p>Since about 2016 I have had a strong <del>obsession</del> love of Haskell. Prior to learning Haskell, I was an experienced OO style developer but I didn’t really know how to keep improving my raw programming ability. Haskell introduced me to the world of functional programming (FP) which has an almost infinite depth of concepts to learn, which do actually help improve code quality and application architecture.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9eeq.jpg" alt="I should learn functional programming meme"></p>

<p>Haskell is challenging to learn, but extremely fun to write. For my own learning and pleasure, if my startup succeeds, I want to be doing Haskell.</p>

<p>Additionally, I think Haskell is the best general purpose programming language (that you can use in production). In particular, Haskell excels at writing ‘boring’ business applications which is typically what I work on. <a href="https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Why Haskell For Production’</a> goes into more detail on the benefits Haskell offers.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9fwz.jpg" alt="Haskell is the best change my mind meme"></p>

<h2 id="the-setup-phase">The Setup Phase</h2>

<p>Probably the most challenging part was building out a skeleton architecture to hang my business logic on. I decided to go with, even within Haskell, fairly advanced libraries of <a href="https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>servant</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>fused-effects</code></a>.</p>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time banging my head against a wall trying to get these libraries to work nicely together. This was primarily from a lack of Haskell ability on my part. I had prepared as best I could, but Haskell is deep and I needed to learn more to work day to day with it. I was lucky enough to eventually find <a href="https://github.com/mitchellwrosen/hspolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example</a> that marries these two libraries together, which was a life saver. I’m sure I would have gotten there eventually, but I was in a bit over my head at that point.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9j14.jpg" alt="Haskell with servant fused-effects is hard meme"></p>

<p>Haskell is awesome, but like most languages there is cruft and legacy to be avoided. Haskell has a standard library known as <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>base</code></a> which unfortunately has a fair amount of unsafe or unperformant functions included. As such I went with an alternative standard library <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>relude</code></a> that builds on and improves <code>base</code>. On top of this, there are many core libraries that are not part of the standard library I wanted to use and have nice patterns around.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was <a href="https://alistairb.dev/haskell-on-google-cloud-is-great">deploying to google cloud</a> and so needed to figure out good patterns for that integration from Haskell.</p>

<p>This setup effort was quite challenging. I spent most of it squinting at compiler errors. Yet it only took about 2 weeks to have a good foundation of code to start building my business logic upon.</p>

<h2 id="building-it-out">Building it Out</h2>

<p>This is when it started to get really fun. I had my core patterns set out and I could focus on building a pipeline. The day in day out of writing out my logic as small pure functions that I composed together was very nice.</p>

<p>Haskell has such impressive auto-magic code generation techniques that you spend much more time focused on the interesting logic of your application rather than boilerplate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>HappinessLevel</span> <span>=</span>

<span>-- ok not really magic, think 'convention over configuration'</span>
<span>-- where you can have generated sane defaults, or customise if you like</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And personally I think Haskell is quite beautiful to read and write. #notbiased</p>

<h3 id="parsing-libraries">Parsing Libraries</h3>

<p>A lot of the logic of Deadpendency is parsing. Either parsing dependency files or parsing various API responses. Haskell has many excellent parsing libraries, most notably <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>aeson</code></a> for JSON.</p>

<p>Why is this nice in Haskell? The ‘monad’ abstraction is excellent for dealing with code with a lot of failure conditions (ie. parsing) and avoids ‘pyramid of doom’ type code. Haskell worked out really well in this key area.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://alistairb.dev/images/hadouken.jpeg" alt="Pyramid of doom meme"></p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Another strong positive for writing Deadpendency was testing. Haskell has a lesser-known style of testing libraries that do ‘property based testing’ (PBT).</p>

<p>PBT allows you to write value generators for your data types, which you use to generate 100s or 1000s of test cases. Then, you run these generated values against some function and check that certain properties hold.</p>

<p>For example, part of the Deadpendency logic is generating an HTML report at the end. I had some <code>toHtml :: Report -&gt; HTML</code> function that I wanted to test. So I wrote a <code>fromHtml :: HTML -&gt; Report</code> function where it goes the other way (ok writing that was pretty painful). Then my PBT test will generate 100s of <code>Report</code> values and check that <code>report == fromHtml (toHtml report)</code> (this is known as ‘roundtrip testing’). With this single test I was able to find many edge case bugs with my HTML report generation logic.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9tqj.jpg" alt="Haskell with servant fused-effects is hard meme"></p>

<p>PBT exists in some other languages, but it originated (I believe?) in Haskell so the libraries are excellent.</p>

<h3 id="not-actively-maintained-libraries">Not Actively Maintained Libraries</h3>

<p>A big challenge of working with Haskell was the lack of well-maintained libraries. Ironically, of the 75 (!) packages I depend upon 19 are flagged by Deadpendency as unhealthy (deprecated or inactive). This means I often don’t have the luxury of asking library maintainers to fix bugs. Even if I PR a fix, sometimes that PR will be ignored for months.</p>

<p>This I think is the reality of using a niche language like Haskell. To be clear, I do not think library developers owe me anything, but it is nonetheless a downside when compared to more popular languages.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9xjq.jpg" alt="Haskell not actively maintained meme"></p>

<p>Thankfully Haskell build tools have good support for loading a package from git. This means you can PR some bug fix or feature and immediately use your fork to work around the problem.</p>

<h3 id="compile-times-were-fine">Compile Times.. Were Fine</h3>

<p>I thought I’d call this out as it is a common complaint I see around Haskell. I followed some <a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2019/11/27/keeping_compilation_fast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good advice</a> which kept compilation fast (aside from <a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairBuzz/status/1253507016242294784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one interesting edge case I resolved</a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of modules (Haskell source files) - 509</li>
  <li>Number of lines of Haskell - 20090</li>
  <li>Number of dependencies - 75</li>
  <li>Dell 9570 XPS Laptop - (Hex core - 8th-gen Intel Core i7-8750H CPU), 32GB memory</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the numbers?</p>

<h4 id="compile-dependencies-from-scratch">Compile dependencies from scratch</h4>

<p>Time: 17m44s</p>

<p>This is compiling all application dependencies, which needs to be done before you can compile your application code. Rebuilding all from scratch rarely happens as both my dev machines and CI will cache and only rebuild what has changed.</p>

<p>You do sometimes update a very core package which triggers a lot of dependent packages to recompile which can take a while. Although, I usually do dependency updates at the start of the day while I’m sipping my coffee, so usually don’t notice.</p>

<h4 id="compile-app-including-tests-in-development">Compile app (including tests) in development</h4>

<p>Time: 1m1s</p>

<p>Likewise, due to caching a full recompilation rarely happens. As such, most code edits do not trigger many modules to be recompiled and it is fast.</p>

<p>Additionally, Haskell has nice ‘continuous compilation’ tools that fire on save. Usually by the time I actually look at my terminal compilation is already done.</p>

<h4 id="compile-app-for-deployment">Compile app for deployment</h4>

<p>with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/using-optimisation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full optimisations</a> (-02).</p>

<p>Time: 2m53s</p>

<p>This typically runs in CI. It runs in parallel with a host of other checks such as running my tests, which also take a few minutes. Due to this, the time doesn’t really impact the build + deploy time too much.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4xp4zu.jpg" alt="Compile times meme"></p>

<h3 id="refactoring-pain">Refactoring Pain</h3>

<p>Deadpendency is relatively simple in what it does, but there is a lot of hidden complexity to the problem. Which is to say, it is like 99% of applications 😉. When developing it I was constantly realising I had modelled things a bit too simplistically and would need to refactor.</p>

<p>Haskell is very safe to refactor thanks to the type safety the compiler brings, which is probably the most important thing. However, Haskell does not have great tools to help with refactoring, at least in terms of the restructuring changes I kept making. The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apply-refact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools</a> seem more geared towards complex rewriting of common code, not restructuring modules or renaming identifiers.</p>

<p>As such I did it all manually with text search replace, or just change something and fix all the new compiler errors. This was a bit of a grind and it caused me to delay needed refactoring sometimes.</p>

<p>It’s a pity Haskell doesn’t have the refactoring tools to help in this situation. The dream would be these tools integrated into an IDE.</p>

<p>(Stolen from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/cjtbfj/society_if_haskell_has_ide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a>)</p>

<p>Having said that, it should be noted that Haskell does have an excellent IDE now in the form of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell Language Server</a> (HLS). The momentum around the project is insane and I applaud the developers. One fixed pain point from HLS is it does auto imports now, which used to greatly contribute to the friction of working with Haskell. I’m sure Haskell will get there eventually.</p>

<h3 id="waiting-for-new-ghc-versions-to-be-usable">Waiting for New GHC Versions to be Usable</h3>

<p>This is mostly me complaining for the sake of it, but as someone pretty obsessed with both new shiny versions of things and Haskell, waiting for new GHC (GHC is the Haskell compiler) versions to be usable has been painful. There is a long tail of libraries and platforms that need to be updated before I can use a new GHC version. Sometimes these updates can drag a lot.</p>

<p>For example GHC 9 was just released, but I still haven’t been able to upgrade to GHC 8.10 yet which was first released in March 2020.</p>

<p><img width="500" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4xebid.jpg" alt="GHC releases meme"></p>

<h2 id="launching">Launching</h2>

<p>So after about 8 months of work I was ready to start getting users. I slowly soft launched, promoting it in a few small channels. How did my Haskell fair in prod?</p>

<h3 id="very-few-logic-bugs">Very Few Logic Bugs</h3>

<p>My core Haskell had very few logic bugs. This is because Haskell is very safe by default and I had opted into strict types that help catch edge cases.</p>

<p>For example, I was using a lot of <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-List-NonEmpty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>NonEmpty</code></a> lists which the compiler will guarantee is not empty. To use them you must specify how to handle the empty case. ie. what do I do if Deadpendency can’t find any dependencies to check?</p>

<p>And of course, I had …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>TLS certificates specifying hosts via their CommonName field is more or less gone</h2>

	<p><small>February 17, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>
certificates for hosts and domains must somehow identify what
hostname (or names) they're for. Historically <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TLSCertificatesNamingHosts">there have been two
ways to do this</a>. The first way was a
specific sub-field, the <em>CN</em> or CommonName, of the certificate's
overall <em>Subject Name</em>. This had the problem that it could only
have one name. When people started wanting to have TLS certificates
that covered more than one name, they invented another mechanism,
the <em>Subject Alternative Name</em> (SAN) extension.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, all vaguely modern software that wants to
properly validate TLS certificates has supported (and often preferred)
Subject Alternative Names for some time. A great many TLS certificates
in the wild are for multiple hosts and it's generally unlikely that the
host you're connecting to is the one name that the system chose to put
in the CN field; software that only supports CN cannot validate those
TLS certificates. As a matter of timing, SANs have been theoretically
mandatory since 2002 and checking only SANs has been theoretically
required since 2011 (which means that since 2011 or earlier, the CN was
supposed to always be one of the SANs).</p>

<p>These days, any remaining support for looking at TLS certificate
CommonName to validate TLS certificates is getting more and more
extinct (and more so than I expected when I started writing this
entry). In the browser realm, <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4981025180483584">Chrome apparently turned it off in
58, released in 2017</a>, and then
threw out the option to check it again in Chrome 65 (from the comment
on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TLSCertificatesNamingHosts">my old entry</a>, which was ironically
written shortly before Chrome did this). Firefox is said to have
removed support in version 48, from August of 2016. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT210176">Safari
apparently stopped looking at CommonName in iOS 13 and macOS 10.15</a>, which I believe date
from late 2019. <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/231379">This Go change</a> also talks about
how browsers removed it in 2019 ('last year' for a mid 2020 change).</p>

<p>In non-browser TLS code, Go started ignoring CN by default in
Go 1.15 (released in August of 2020) and this will be the only
option starting in Go 1.17 (to be released in August of 2021),
per <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#crypto/x509">here</a>. Since
Firefox doesn't support CN any more, I assume that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a> doesn't
either, since NSS is basically Firefox's underlying TLS implementation.
I have no idea what other TLS libraries are doing, but I would expect
that many of them will support CommonName for some time to come; TLS
libraries are historically behind browser practices.  Hopefully they
are all following the 2011 requirement to check only SANs when SANs are
present (which they should always be in public certificates).</p>

<p>Probably TLS certificates will continue to contain CommonName fields
for a long time to come. Having a <em>Subject Name</em> in general is
common (although apparently not actually required) and the CN is a
standard (although not required) part of the Subject Name, so you
might as well throw it in. Even Mozilla and Let's Encrypt (still)
have TLS certificates with CNs. However, since I checked this now,
the current <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a> <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">baseline
requirements</a>
(version 1.7.3) allow but don't require CommonName (section 7.1.4.2.2,
which says that it's 'discouraged, but not prohibited'). Given how
conservative most Certificate Authorities are, I expect them to be
issuing TLS certificates with CommonName fields until they're
required to stop.</p>

<p>(An interested party could scan Certificate Transparency logs to see if
there were very many issued certificates without CNs. Probably there are
some; someone must have tried it out at some point through an official
CA.)</p>

<p>PS: <a href="https://no-common-name.badssl.com/">no-common-name.badssl.com</a>
has a TLS certificate without a CN, or at least it's supposed to
(<a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/how-to-obtain-a-cert-without-a-common-name/72807/6">via</a>),
but the TLS certificate is expired right now as I write this entry
so it's hard to test how client software behaves. <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/compatibility-testing-of-no-common-name/72863">See also</a>,
which pointed me to <a href="https://no-subject.labs.vu.nl/">no-subject.labs.vu.nl</a>,
which has a currently valid TLS certificate with no <em>Subject Name</em> at all.</p>

		Year History of Opposition to Nuclear Power in California </span></b></span> 
		<br>
	  </p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California 
		citizens have made a unique stand concerning the attempts by Nuclear proponents 
		to make the state a premiere model for commercial nuclear energy. California's major 
		utilities, in particular Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) has spent an
		enormous amount of money and political muscle in attempts to build reactors 
		across California but have mostly failed. PG&amp;E was supposedly involved in 
		the Atoms for Peace proposal made in 1953 and was 
		part of a coalition of american utilities that investigated the technical 
		potentials for building nuclear reactors as a source of electricity.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following 
		is a brief summary of the battles against nuclear power that started here 
		in California in 1958.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
		California is the home of the first successful opposition to the promotion 
		and development of commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. In the 1950's 
		northern and central California's privately Owned utility company, PG&amp;E 
		was planning to be one of the giants in the new field of nuclear energy. 
		It had helped design and build the Dresden I reactor in Illinois with 
		a consortium of 5 major companies, including General Electric(GE).</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conjunction 
		with GE, it built the vallecitos nuclear complex south of San Francisco 
		and then went it alone with their Humboldt reactor near Arcata. But their 
		luck took a turn for the worse when they tried to build the world's largest 
		nuclear facility 1000 feet from the fault that caused the 1906 earthquake.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, PG&amp;E 
		even said they could build a reactor in downtown San Francisco! In 
		fact they were planning the construction of 63 reactors in California 
		during the early 1960's, one every 25 miles along the coast They even 
		 planned to build a floating reactor!!</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Bodega Bay Duck Pond</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When PG&amp;E 
		started pushing plans to build the reactors at Bodega Pay in 1958 a literal 
		groundswell of opposition erupted during the next 6 years to stop them 
		dead cold. The site they had chosen near the San Andreas Fault Zone was 
		just a few miles from the epicenter of the Great San Francisco Quake where 
		ground shifts of over 20 feet had occurred in 1906.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		unethical plans to build the reactor is not new for this company, as they 
		have a history of unfair tactics that goes back to the company's birth. 
		Upon deciding that the Bodega Headlands would be an excellent site for the largest nuclear 
		facility in the world, PG&amp;E simply beat the state out in its plans 
		to make the area a state park. </span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The battle 
		started in 1958 when the Santa Rosa Press Democrat published the first 
		story on PG&amp;E's plans. The company's ignored their own geologist, who had warned 
		that the area was likely to be effected by strong shaking during a quake. 
		Concerned citizens started getting involved as PG&amp;E refused to acknowledge 
		publicly that they were actually going to build nuclear reactors at the 
		proposed site.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1957 
		windscale accident in England, where a small reactor had burned out of 
		control for more than a day, helped focus concerns about safety on this 
		new idea of nuclear power.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1961, 
		after nearly 3 years of pushing their plan behind the scenes, PG&amp;E 
		announced plans to build the Atomic Park at the Bodega site. The ensuing battle 
		and PG&amp;E's nasty style started to backfire though as public concerns 
		grew.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major opposition 
		came from within the ranks of the Sierra Club, but the board refused to 
		allow its active members the right to oppose the reactors on the issue 
		of earthquakes. When it came out that PG&amp;E had doctored fault maps 
		of the site, all hell broke loose.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of PG&amp;E's 
		major claims at the time was that they could build reactors that would 
		survive a great Earthguake. At one point they said that the reactors could 
		survive a quake 50 per cent bigger than the O6' quake by floating the 
		reactors on 3 feet of compressable material but when the public and the 
		Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) got a close-up view of the devastation 
		from the air of the quake in Alaska during the spring of 1964, support 
		for the reactor complex dried up.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents 
		had "infiltrated" the federal government and were pushing 
		for closure. With the disclosure of the AEC's WASH 740 report, which documented 
		potential dangers to the bay area residents in case of an accident, opposition 
		finally reached all government levels.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California 
		governor Pat Brown asked that PG&amp;E abandon the reactors. Two days 
		later PG&amp;E caved in and called the project off. The battle ended in 
		1964 with a $7 million duck pond as a living monunent to the future. (It 
		is still there today)</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This experience 
		gave PG&amp;E a deadly lesson on how to overcome public concerns at their 
		next reactor site--Diablo Canyon.</span></p>

	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 25 year 
		battle over Diablo Canyon is a classic case of courage in the face of 
		the political power this utility unleashed in its drive to build a major 
		nuclear facility in California.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		plans to build a mega facility shifted south to the less populated coastal 
		area near San Luis Obispo. The company purchased the Nipomo Dunes and 
		told environmental leaders that unless an acceptable site was chosen that 
		they would go ahead and build a facility at the popular beach area. The 
		wife of the Sierra Club president was selected to come up with an acceptable 
		site in secrecy with the company. </span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site 
		chosen, Diablo Canyon, was California's second to last coastal wilderness 
		area, an area that had been proposed as a National Park due to its beauty. 
		Besides being a sacred Chumash burial ground, it was the home of one of 
		a kind 1,000 year old Oak trees (the largest in the world). It was also 
		the home of one of the state's largest populations of abalone and sea 
		otters.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the process 
		of getting permission to go ahead with Diablo, PG&amp;E suceeded in selling 
		the site to key members of the Sierra Club's board of directors. The Utility 
		had sympathetic board members flown over the Diablo site in Frank Sinatra's 
		Lear jet, with entertainment by Danny Kaye (Danny later came out against 
		the reactors).</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 
		slam-dunk by PG&amp;E came against the local farmer who had the right 
		of way access rights over the Diablo property. The company went to court 
		and had his rights removed. The beligerant act made the man a life-long 
		opponent of PG&amp;E's plan.</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PG&amp;E 
		gets Cozy with Sierra Club Board Members</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The biggest 
		tactical plan was to focus on the Sierra Club. The company and the electric 
		industry already had the board's ear with their claims that nuclear power 
		could reduce air pollution that was caused by coal power plants. The utility, 
		with inside help then sought official support for Diablo Canyon when club's 
		only board member who knew about the site's natural value was in Europe. 
		The board went along with PG&amp;E, and in fact voted to block any Club 
		members or chapters opposition to the facility. This move enraged David 
		Brower, eventually resulting in the split up of the club and the creation 
		of Friends of the Earth by embittered Sierra Club members who were angered 
		by the actions of key Sierra Club Board members.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PG&amp;E's 
		success within the Sierra Club was the culmination of 2 years of behind 
		the scenes work by Doris Leonard. She was the wife of the president of 
		the club. Her role in exchanging the Nipomo Dunes site for Diablo Canyon 
		was rewarded later when she was elected to PG&amp;E's board of directors. 
		</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra 
		Club refused to allow its local chapter near Diablo to use the club nane 
		in opposing the five proposed reactors at the site. The group was forced 
		to take on another name in 1966, the Shoreline Preservation Conference.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group 
		was concerned about earthquake faults along the coast as locals were fully 
		aware of the 1927 quake that completely destroyed a nearby city. They 
		called for a full investigation into potential fault areas. Their efforts 
		were ignored by the government and the media.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News of the 
		reactor siting was poorly covered by the Bay area's conservative media, 
		a tactic that made the issue invisible to bay area residents who had stopped 
		PG&amp;E's Bodega reactor plans.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil companies 
		chart the Hosgri Fault The Hosgri fault had been mapped by Shell oil geologists 
		during the 1960's, but not published until 1970. PG&amp;E claims to have 
		not found out about the fault until late 1972. The information was finally 
		publicized in November 1973 by an investigative reporter in Los Angeles. 
		In a suspicious turn of events, the lawyer who had been fighting the case 
		since 1965 was found dead in his car just after the announcement. Authorities 
		claimed it was suicide, with no other investigation to follow up.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">P&amp;GE's 
		bad memories of Bodega Bay helped fuel their push to ignore earthquake 
		concerns at Diabl Canyon. The same Seismic experts who had been involved 
		with the Bodega Bay facility were brought in to review the site for seismicity. 
		They pointed out major flaws in PG&amp;E's own $2,000 seismic study. A 
		state of the art study at the time would have cost $100,000)</span></p>
	  <h2><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
		Hosgri Fault Forces PG&amp;E to Rebuild Diablo Again</b><br>
		</span></h2>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A storm of 
		controversy erupted around the facility as one of the units was reaching 
		completion. Even with the help of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
		(NRC) predecessor, the AEC, PG&amp;E was finally forced after 3 years 
		of federal in-fighting to rebuild seismic bracing in 1976.</span></p>
	  <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In attempts 
		to stop a seismic retrofit, PG&amp;E even coined the Tao Effect which

On this journey, I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to wear a lot of different hats in the making of a digital product.&nbsp;</p><p>I've worked as Interface designer, Front-end developer, UX Designer, Product Designer and lastly, as a Product Manager. All along the way, I've always had a close relationship with engineers, learning everything I could about development and understanding all the effort and creativity necessary to bring products to life.</p><p>To keep this valuable for a wider audience and range of professionals, I've tried to extract the essence of I believe to be essential to keep in mind when building products.</p><p>Loading...</p><h2>Purpose</h2><p><strong>Everything starts with a clear purpose.</strong></p><p>When building products, you have to be an<!-- --> <strong>eternal optimist about your mission </strong> –  to help you get through the rough times, and<!-- --> <strong>very pessimist about execution </strong> –  it always takes way more time and effort to nail it.</p><p><strong>Build great products takes time; it's a long-term commitment.</strong> <!-- -->It's almost impossible (in my experience) to immerse yourself in a work whose purpose isn't aligned with your beliefs.</p><p>Without a clear purpose for you (and your team), it's tough to find an intrinsic motivation to keep iterating your product on a problem space.</p><p>Loading...</p><h2>Constraints</h2><blockquote>"...Here is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. Constraints of price, of size, of strength, of balance, of surface, of time, and so forth. Each problem has its own peculiar list."<p>Charles &amp; Ray Eames</p></blockquote><p>I love this excerpt from an<!-- --> <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/stories/why-magazine/design-q-and-a-charles-and-ray-eames/">interview with Charles and Ray Eames</a> <!-- -->in 1972 about Design. This quote stayed on my mind since the first time I've read it.</p><p><strong>Embracing constraints is essential to creativity.</strong> The primary fuel to your problem-solving is to identify what restrictions you're dealing with.</p><p>Your purpose is what drives your "willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints." Once you have a clear purpose and goal in mind, you have to "identify as many constraints as possible" to have a clear problem space to tackle, and sometimes you need to enforce additional constraints.</p><p>I like to think about constraints in two spectrums:</p><ul><li>From <strong>hard constraints</strong> to<!-- --> <strong>self-imposed constraints</strong>;</li><li>From <strong>under constraint</strong> to<!-- --> <strong>over constraint</strong>;</li></ul><h3>Hard &amp; Self-imposed constraints</h3><p><strong>Hard constraints</strong> are the ones that you have little to no influence under it. It's time, resources, team, skills, funding, knowledge, market conditions, laws, available technology, and so on. It's the constraints that you'll have to work within, no matter what.</p><p><strong>Self-imposed constraints</strong> are the ones you set to have a clear problem space and increase your focus. It could come in different shapes. It could be your values, product principles, strategy, and everything else you and your team agree on that helps you stay on the right path. It's your conscious trade-offs.</p><h3>Under &amp; Over Constraints</h3><p><strong>An under constrained problem space will be too broad and challenging to narrow down what really matters.</strong> <!-- -->You'll see yourself drowned in the endless possibilities to solve problems. When you find yourself in this scenario, it's better to enforce new constraints and make trade-offs to eliminate noise.</p><p>On the other hand,<!-- --> <strong>when you over constrain it, you won't leave room for improvisation, innovation, and adaption when it's needed.</strong> <!-- -->You have to find a sweet spot on this spectrum to have the freedom to experiment.</p><p><strong>Identifying the right constraints and balancing them is an ongoing challenge.</strong> <!-- -->Your team will grow, new technologies will enable new solutions, markets, and users will continuously evolve.</p><p>You have to keep your eyes open to see what stays true and what helps you stay focused on what matters.<!-- --> </p><p>Loading...</p><h3>Shaping friction</h3><p><strong>Your goal when designing a product is to shape friction.</strong> <!-- -->You'll have to shape as many frictions as possible from your user's journey to achieve the desired outcome. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimize your user acquisition </strong> – remove friction from each step of the funnel;</li><li><strong>Improve engagement </strong> – remove friction to make core actions more intuitive and accessible;</li><li><strong>Reduce churn </strong> –  remove friction that is keeping users away from their goals;</li><li><strong>Avoid unintended behaviors </strong> –  Instagram adding features to avoid users (adding friction) to pos offensive content;</li><li>You got the point…</li></ul><p><mark><strong>To identify which friction worth solving/shaping, you have to have a deep understating of your product and the people using it.</strong></mark> <!-- -->You'll have to know product goals and the user's job-to-be-done (context, objectives, functional and emotional needs).</p><p>In essence, your job is to continuously iterate, shape, and balance the right amount of friction on each part of the product.</p><h3>Prioritization &amp;&nbsp;Judgment</h3><p>Loading...</p><p><strong><mark>Prioritization is one of the most essential subjects in building products.</mark></strong></p><p>There are endless techniques, frameworks, mental models, and tools to help you make the right decisions when prioritizing your next move.</p><p>The truth is that it's tough to make the "best" decisions, even when you have lots of qualitative and quantitative insights (not the case for early-stage products) to inform your prioritization.</p><p><strong>Confident decision making takes time</strong>. When working on a high-growth startup, you'll have to be comfortable with the uncertainty, lack of time, data, and resources to make the right call.</p><p>Another critical factor to keep in mind is your (and your team's) biases. Even when you have plenty of data at your disposal, you and your team are always influenced by some bias (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" title="Cognitive biases" target="_blank">confirmation bias and others</a>).</p><p>There will be times when you won't have enough data, other times you won't have enough time, and most of the time, you won't be aware of your biases.</p><p>That leads me to my last point, <strong>judgment</strong>.

February 17, 2021 | https://trigonaminima.github.io/2021/02/dspods_website/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://trigonaminima.github.io/2021/02/dspods_website/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>A few months back, I was looking for some good Data Science podcasts, and the only sources I found were blog posts with reviews about a few podcasts. Many of those podcasts were no longer active. A few hosts explicitly mentioned that on their homepages, and some just stopped creating new episodes. Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts - where you can subscribe to a podcast - none of them showed if a podcast was inactive. You’ve to deduce it on your own. These services also don’t tell you if a podcast is about Data Science, Machine Learning, or ML Engineering.</p>

<p>So I decided to create a website having a regularly updated list of all such podcasts. I enjoyed developing this website. This is coming from someone who has never done any decent web development work except tweaking some HTML or CSS here and there. Here’s how I made this free website.</p>

<h2 id="guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</h2>

<p>I wanted my whole setup to be uncomplicated and quick. Once the design is complete, I don’t want to touch HTML/CSS/JS files again unless for a tweak or update, and even then, it should be minimal. It should be easy to add a new podcast. Most importantly, I wanted most of the things to be automated.</p>

<h2 id="static-pages">Static Pages</h2>

<p>I have no experience with JavaScript so, I skipped any JS Frameworks. I decided to go ahead with a vanilla static site. I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate static pages that one can host anywhere. I am familiar with Jekyll because I use it to build this blog. Another advantage is that GitHub makes it frictionless to build and host a static website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. Lastly, adding a new blog entry is straightforward: add a simple text file with YAML front matter and boom.</p>

<h2 id="website-design">Website Design</h2>

<p>I rarely start working on things from scratch. I begin with copying being the first step and then taking it beyond the initial design. Jekyll provides a lot of <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">free themes</a> created by others. I started with <a href="https://www.wowthemes.net/mediumish-free-jekyll-template/">Mediumish Jekyll Theme</a> as my first step. It used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to design the interface, which was fortunate for me, as I had a tiny bit of experience in it.</p>

<p>I made significant modifications to make the website look the way I had imagined. I knew a large chunk of visitors would visit the website from their mobile devices, so I had to make the website behave properly with small screens, a.k.a. design it responsively. Making that homepage grid behave appropriately with different widths was a bunch of work. Firefox’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode">Responsive Design Mode</a> helped a lot. With time I figured out all the parts. I learned many new things: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport">Viewport</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE&amp;t">Flexbox</a>, the background of the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">Responsive Design from Smashing Magazine</a>, about Media Queries, and more. I also connected with a friend from my previous company for a Flexbox issue I was facing. In the end, I was satisfied with the result.</p>

<p>Designing the website an involved process for me. How do you ensure that it looks how you intend on all devices? Is there something like <em>unit-tests</em> for a front-end or design of a website? I know there are tools like Selenium and others which can open a website in a headless browser and aid in testing its functionality. I found this Stack Overflow question on the topic - <a href="https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/32837/what-are-general-tips-to-test-a-static-website">What are general tips to test a static website?</a>. Most of the answers were either manual checklists or websites which evaluate your website on few metric.</p>

<p>After I had hosted the website, I evaluated my website through the following links and made a multitude of changes to improve the score:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://web.dev/measure/">Google’s Measure Tool</a> for performance, accessibility, use of best practices, and SEO.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each podcast, I display a card on the homepage with its image and other details. Minimized the large images with <a href="https://tinypng.com/">tinypng</a> and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> (learned the basics of GIMP). Minified the CSS and JS files, so they take less time to download. Added alt text for images and did most of the suggested accessibility changes. In the process of removing these latencies, I discovered the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/coverage">Coverage Tab in Chrome DevTools</a>. I was using Firefox developer tools, so I didn’t know Chrome had something like this. It was cool.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I used <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host my website. GitHub supports Jekyll right out of the box: I didn’t even have to upload the final HTML files. GitHub will do all of it on its own on every push to the remote repository. One problem was that the hosted website would be available at <a href="https://shivamrana.me/dspods/">shivamrana.me/dspods</a>, and I didn’t want the URL. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to the rescue. Netlify hosts a static website and gives you a domain like <code>dspods.netlify.app</code>, where we can put anything in place of <code>dspods</code>. It also directly links with a GitHub repository. Give it build instructions and permission to pull the repository. It’ll pull the code on every push, build, and host it at the specified domain. Of course, you can use your domain name with both GitHub and Netlify.</p>

<p>So Now I’ve automated the continuous deployment pipeline. Update the code, and push it to the GitHub repository. GitHub will build it and host it at the <a href="https://shivamrana.me/dspods/">shivamrana.me/dspods</a> URL. Netlify will also build it and host it at the <a href="https://dspods.netlify.app/">dspods.netlify.app</a>. GitHub build is redundant, but I don’t know of a way to stop it. Thus, the whole pipeline is fully automated. Pretty neat, huh?</p>

<h2 id="regular-podcast-updates">Regular Podcast Updates</h2>

<p>The only thing remaining is the daily podcast updates. I can’t manually update and push the changes daily. It needs to be automated. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> FTW. It was a complete game-changer. Without this, I couldn’t have made this website free.</p>

<p>How does it work? Create a workflow with the instructions to get the updates, commit them, and push them to the repository. A Python script parses the RSS feed of each podcast for updates. The workflow runs daily at midnight. Once the commit is pushed, GitHub and Netlify then get on with their jobs to build and deploy the website.</p>

<p>The whole pipeline is automated now.</p>

<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>

<p>I’ve also added <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a> to see the kind of response there is for the website. You add a small snippet to your website, and it handles all the analytics of your website.</p>

<h2 id="reception-and-whats-next">Reception and What’s Next?</h2>

<p>When I posted the link on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">r/MachineLearning</a>, people liked the website and gave me a lot more podcasts to add. You can read the discussion <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/liz35x/d_podcasts_about_machine_learning_and_data_science/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The next thing I want to do is to make the podcast page a bit more informative. I want to provide some insights about the podcasts to the users. The users should understand what kind of things the podcast has discussed in the past.</p>

<p>I also want to work on the discoverability of the podcasts on the homepage. How can a user narrow down the podcast she may want to listen to? If you have any suggestions regarding this, I am happy to hear them.</p>

<p>My hole for this website is to become a go-to place where people find the next Data Science podcast they want to listen to.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I wanted to write about how easy it is to build a free website today. This post was my attempt at that. I hope this will be useful to you. Here’s a laundry list of the tools I’ve used to build this website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free static site generator: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></li>
  <li>Free hosting: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
  <li>Free domain: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
  <li>Free website evaluation: <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">Google’s Measure Tool</a></li>
  <li>Free website automates updates: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a></li>
  <li>Free Analytics: <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The open-source website having a collection of podcasts about Machine Learning, Data Science, and ML Engineering is available at - <a href="https://dspods.netlify.app/">DSPods</a>. The website offers filtering and search options to find podcasts according to your needs. The source code is available at the <a href="https://github.com/TrigonaMinima/dspods">GitHub Repo</a>. Adding a new podcast is easy: add a simple text file with YAML front matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_2020">Mars 2020</a>, NASA’s latest mission to Mars, was launched a couple weeks ago. However, with all the Tianwen-1 work down the pipeline, until now I haven’t had time to dedicate an appropriate post to this mission (though I showed some <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1289322621360730113">sneak peek on Twitter</a>). This mission consists of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseverance_(rover)">rover</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Helicopter_Ingenuity">helicopter</a> (a real novelty in space exploration). Both were launched with the cruise stage and the entry, descent and landing system on July 30 from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41">Cape Canaveral</a>, an are currently on their transfer orbit to Mars, as Tianwen-1 and Emirates Mars Mission.</p>



<p>In this post I will be working with some recordings made by <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/">AMSAT-DL</a> using the <a href="https://amsat-dl.org/en/20-meter-antenna/">20m radio telescope at Bochum’s observatory</a>. These feature the low rate safe mode telemetry, which was very strong and caused some anecdotes as it <a href="https://twitter.com/nascom1/status/1288828268552916992">saturated some NASA DSN receivers</a>, and the nominal 10kbps telemetry signal that was switched on later. Here I will describe the modulation and coding, giving <a href="https://www.gnuradio.org/">GNU Radio</a> decoders, and also take a look at the data. <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/?action=home">r00t.cz</a> has also written a <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Mars2020">post</a> where he shows similar information.</p>



<h4>Safe mode modulation and coding</h4>



<p>Mars 2020’s X-band downlink is at approximately 8414.9 MHz. When in safe mode, a baudrate of only 80 baud is transmitted using PCM/PSK/PM (see <a href="https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/files/phase1.pdf">this document</a> for the terminology). This means that the telemetry is a PSK signal modulated onto a subcarrier which is then phase modulated onto a residual carrier. The subcarrier in this case is a 25kHz square wave.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the spectrum of the signal, as recorded in Bochum on 2020-07-30 20:25 UTC. We see the central residual carrier at a slight offset from 0Hz, and then the data sidebands and their odd harmonics. We have only odd harmonics because of the square wave subcarrier. A sine wave subcarrier produces both even and odd harmonics when phase modulated.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec.png"><img width="644" height="382" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec-644x382.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec-644x382.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec-300x178.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec-768x455.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec.png 837w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>If we zoom in to the centre of the modulation, we see that the data sidebands are very narrow, owing to the low baudrate.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec_zoom.png"><img width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec_zoom-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec_zoom-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec_zoom-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec_zoom-768x460.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_safe_mode_spec_zoom.png 829w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The coding is CCSDS Turbo frames as described in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding blue book</a>. A rate of 1/2 and frame size of 223 bytes is used. Note that each frame takes 45.5 seconds to transmit, due to the low baudrate.</p>



<p>The GNU Radio decoder flowgraph is shown in the figure below (click on it to view in full size). Its structure is very similar to other PCM/PSK/PM demodulators I’ve shown in previous posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/tianwen-1-telemetry-modulation-and-coding/" data-type="post" data-id="8747">the one for Tianwen-1</a>. The residual carrier is locked with a PLL (here using a bandwidth of 200Hz), the imaginary part of the signal is taken to extract the data sideband, the subcarrier is moved down to baseband, and then clock recovery and subcarrier recovery using a Costas loop are done. Finally, Turbo decoding is done with the blocks from <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-dslwp/tree/maint38">gr-dslwp</a>. The flowgraph can be found <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Mars2020/mars2020_safemode.grc">here</a>.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the decoder running. The signal is very strong, so the constellation is quite clean. We can see in the spectrum of the BPSK subcarrier that the data symbols are not filtered, since some sidelobes are visible.</p>

<h4>10kbps modulation and coding</h4>



<p>The nominal 10kbps signal replaces the safe mode modulation during normal spacecraft operations. The modulation is 60kbaud PCM/PM/NRZ. This means that the data is directly phase-modulated onto the residual carrier.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the spectrum of the signal as recorded by Bochum on 2020-07-31 20:04 UTC. We can see the residual carrier and the data modulation, which can be approximated by a BPSK modulation in quadrature with the carrier.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_spec.png"><img width="644" height="382" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_spec-644x382.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_spec-644x382.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_spec-300x178.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_spec-768x455.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_spec.png 837w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The coding is CCSDS Turbo frames as in the safe mode signal, but here a rate of 1/6 and frame size of 1115 bytes are used to improve the low Eb/N0 performance. As such, frames take around 0.9 seconds to transmit.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the GNU Radio decoder flowgraph for the 10kbps signal. A slightly different approach from the <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/decoding-emirates-mars-mission-hope/" data-type="post" data-id="8670">Emirates Mars Mission decoder</a> (which is also PCM/PM/NRZ) is used here. The residual carrier is locked with a PLL (with 50Hz bandwidth) and then the imaginary part of the signal is taken to obtain the BPSK modulation. Clock recovery is made with an ML TED and polyphase root-raised cosine filter. Turbo decoding is done with the gr-dslwp blocks, as for the safe mode signal. The decoder can be found <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Mars2020/mars2020.grc">here</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps.png"><img src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps-644x592.png" alt="" width="644" height="592" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps-644x592.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps-300x276.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps-768x706.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps.png 1232w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Mars 2020 10kbps mode GNU Radio decoder flowgraph</figcaption></figure>



<p>The decoder is shown below running. The signal is not very strong, and there are many bit errors, but the Turbo decoder is still able to correct most of them, so the frame error rate is low.</p>



<figure><img width="644" height="355" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_running-644x355.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_running-644x355.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_running-300x166.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_running-768x424.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_running-1536x848.png 1536w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_10kbps_running.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"><figcaption>Mars 2020 safe mode GNU Radio decoder flowgraph</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Framing</h4>



<p>The framing is the same for the safe mode and 10kbps signals, so it is described here for both. The frames are AOS Space Data Link frames as described in the CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS Space Data Link Protocol blue book</a>. The frames contain a CRC-16 used to discard frames with uncorrected errors.</p>






<p>In the recordings I have examined, only spacecraft ID 168 and virtual channel 0 are used in the AOS frames. The payload of the frames contains Space Packets (see the CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2.pdf">Space Packet protocol blue book</a>) using the M_PDU protocol.</p>



<p>The Space Packets contain a secondary header which is a 6 byte timestamp using the CUC format (see the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/301x0b4e1.pdf">Time Code Formats blue book</a>). This means that the timestamp is a 48 bit counter, which in this case uses units of \(2^{-16}\) seconds. The epoch for the counter is the J2000 epoch, which is 2000-01-01 12:00:00. I am not sure about the timescale used (UTC, TAI, etc.), since the timestamps are somewhat off with respect to the timestamp in the recording filename.</p>



<h4>Safe mode frames</h4>



<p>Since safe mode frames take so long to transmit, I have only 4 frames extracted from the short recording. The last of them is partly corrupted, due to the signal fading out, so it has incorrect CRC. The frames are shown below, with one frame per row. As we will see later, the blue bands correspond to ASCII text.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/safe_mode_frames.png"><img width="644" height="130" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/safe_mode_frames-644x130.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/safe_mode_frames-644x130.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/safe_mode_frames-300x61.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/safe_mode_frames-768x155.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/safe_mode_frames.png 1161w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Mars 2020 safe mode frames</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are 7 space packets in these frames. The first four belong to APID 8, and the remaining three to the idle APID 2047. The packet timestamps, shown below, are quite interesting. We see that the first four packets (which are those in APID 8 having useful data) were generated almost simultaneously and are sent when possible, due to the low data rate. According to the filename, the recording starts on 20:25:19 UTC. The last three packets are idle and presumable have real-time timestamps. The timestamp spacing for these is 45.5 seconds, which is precisely the duration of the frames.</p>

2020-07-30T20:27:29.405853312</pre>



<p>The APID 2047 idle packets are filled in with an ASCII text as an Easter egg. However, the safe mode frames are too short to contain the full text, so it will be shown later in the 10kbps frames.</p>



<p>The packets in APID 8 contain the following ASCII strings, as well as some binary data</p>



<pre>seqengv
tsfp_15000
seqbg
cbm</pre>



<h4>10kbps mode frames</h4>



<p>A total of 950 frames were extracted from the recording. From these, only 4 have incorrect CRC. The frames can be seen in the figure below. Most of the frames have an idle packet with the Easter egg ASCII text, as shown by the blue bars (the deep blue blocks are ASCII spaces). The more irregular block near the top is a transmission of old telemetry data.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10kbps_frames.png"><img width="644" height="549" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10kbps_frames-644x549.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10kbps_frames-644x549.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10kbps_frames-300x256.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10kbps_frames-768x654.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10kbps_frames.png 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>Below we show the number of frames lost according to the virtual channel frame count.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_frame_loss.png"><img width="644" height="348" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_frame_loss-644x348.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_frame_loss-644x348.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_frame_loss-300x162.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_frame_loss.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>There are three APIDs active in this recording: APID 2047, which contains idle packets and has 741 packets, APID 9, which contains some real time telemetry and has 58 packets, and APID 247, which contains old telemetry and has 14 packets. The distribution of the packets can be seen well in the figure below, which shows the timestamps classified by APID. We see that most of the time an idle packet is transmitted, with occasional real-time telemetry in APID 9. For some time, old data is transmitted in APID 247, while the real-time APID 9 data continues.</p>



<figure><img width="644" height="333" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_timestamps-644x333.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_timestamps-644x333.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_timestamps-300x155.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mars2020_timestamps.png 749w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></figure>



<p>The packets in APID 9 contain data in a format which is difficult to parse. It is a tag-value format in which there is a 2 byte tag describing the type of field and then the field itself. The problem is that the field length is implicit. This can be seen in the block below, which shows the first 64 bytes of the payload of some APID 9 packets in hex. Most of them start by the tag <code>0x027a</code>, then there is a <code>float64</code> value, then the tag <code>0x027d</code> followed by a 32 bit field, the the tag <code>0x027e</code>, etc.</p>

<p>The problem with parsing this kind of data is guessing the length of each field. However, I have made a heuristic algorithm that doesn’t do such a bad job. It is based on the fact that often one tag and the next one are related: the second tag …</p></div></article></div>

      <p><span>Dan Bongino is, in many ways, the perfect conservative strongman. Muscular and imposing, his mere existence as a voice on the right scores culture war points against the perceived droves of left-wing soyboys. His profiles boast that he is a New York Times bestselling author and former Secret Service agent, a former proximity to the presidency which affords him an air of credibility when talking politics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He is also a rampant purveyor of misinformation. His bestselling book, </span><i><span>Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald Trump</span></i><span> proliferates the disproven conspiracy theory that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton used spies to attempt to sabotage Trump’s 2016 campaign. He cast doubt over the effectiveness of masks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. His page was a hub of 2020 election conspiracy theories. As recently as February 10, Bongino posted on his Facebook page claiming that Democrats used doctored footage in Trump’s impeachment trial, a claim which was </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/11/blog-posting/no-house-democrats-impeachment-video-did-not-viola/"><span>quickly disproved</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Despite, or&nbsp;more likely because of all these things, Bongino is one of the most popular figures on Facebook. His page has over 2 million likes and over 3.4 million followers, and its posts, which link to his live show and website, consistently rank among the top-performing links on the site. But Bongino is not the only conservative figure posting misinformation and thriving on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kevin Roose, a columnist at the New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/technology/dan-bongino-has-no-idea-why-facebook-loves-him.html"><span>who has covered Bongino</span></a><span>, has been using the Facebook-owned analytics service Crowdtangle to share the top 10 highest-performing links on Facebook since July 22, 2020 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10"><span>on Twitter</span></a><span>. Using Roose’s data, the Business of Business tracked the top-performing link since September 28 — the day before the first televised debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden took place. The data revealed that throughout the election season and as recently as last week, posts from conservative media figures with histories of spreading misinformation have consistently ranked among the best performing links on the site.</span></p>
<p>In fact, posts from conservative media pages — including&nbsp;figures like Bongino and Ben Shapiro, news outlets such as Fox News and Newsmax, and pages in support of Donald Trump such as USA Patriots for Donald Trump — made up for 68% of the 880 top performing links on Facebook during the recorded period.</p>
<p>Not every single day since September 28 has been tracked; of the last 137 days since our count began, the list of top-performing links was only provided for 88. The race chart below shows which pages had top-performing links on every recorded day, as well as how many posts from that page were in the top 10.</p>

<p><a href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4637294/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4637294" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg"> </a></p>
<p>Conservative pages performed well throughout the entire recorded period — most notably on the days of or after major political events took place.</p>
<p>On September 29, the day of the first Presidential debate, nine of the top 10 performing links came from conservative pages including Fox News, Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, Donald Trump and USA Patriots for Donald Trump — a trend which continued for the following two debates. On the day of the Vice Presidential Debate, posts from Bongino made up half of the top-performing links on Facebook. By the second Presidential debate, Bongino had eight of the top performing links with the other two belonging to Fox News and CNN.</p>
<p>On election day, posts from Bongino, Trump, Dr. Ben &amp; Candy Carson, and Fox News had seven of the top performing links, with the other three belonging to CNN and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. On November 7 — the day the Associated Press and several other media outlets began calling the election for Joe Biden — Donald Trump was the lone conservative figure with a link in the top 10, with the others belonging to news outlets like CNN, NPR, The New York Times and liberal pundit Rachel Maddow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it only took one day for conservative media to reclaim its spot with the majority of the top-performing posts. By November 9, Donald Trump dominated the top 10 with five posts, with others belonging to Dan Bongino, religious conservative and Trump supporter Franklin Graham, and Newsmax — the only odd one out was a single post from then Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris. Twitter and Facebook's suspensions of Donald Trump's accounts and other conservative accounts on January 8&nbsp;only added fuel to&nbsp;the fire — just one day later on January 9, Bongino, Shapiro, Fox News, Brietbart and Brigitte Gabriel had seven of the top 10 performing links.</p>

<p>Though 103 pages had links in the top 10 during the recorded period, a table of the&nbsp;20 pages with the highest volume of top-performing links&nbsp;on Facebook shows the chokehold conservative media has on the platform. Bongino dominates the&nbsp;list not just among conservative figures but across all of Facebook. Links from Bongino’s page appeared in 84 of the 88 recorded days, with a total count of 197 links. The page with the next-highest volume of links in the top 10 was Fox News with 117, followed by Ben Shapiro with 70.&nbsp;Of the 103 pages with top-performing links, 67 of them only had one or two links appear in a daily top 10.</p>
<p><span>The majority&nbsp;of the top-performing conservative media links came from pundits like Bongino and Shapiro as well as from politicians like Ted Cruz, with slightly less</span><span>&nbsp;coming from conservative media outlets and pages in explicit support of Donald Trump. CNN, NPR and The New York Times are the only non-conservative media outlets to be among the top 10 performing pages during the recorded period with </span>67, 33 and 20<span>&nbsp;of the top-performing links respectively.&nbsp;</span><span>Robert Reich was the top-performing Democratic pundit with only </span>10<span> top-performing posts during the 88 recorded days.</span></p>
<p><span>Ben Shapiro, former editor-at-large of Brietbart and creator of conservative media site The Daily Wire, is well-known across social media for his controversial beliefs, books and show, </span><i><span>The Ben Shapiro Show</span></i><span>. In the past, Shapiro has made several dubious claims, such as when he </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/"><span>falsely argued</span></a><span> that over half of the world’s Muslim population was radicalized. Shapiro is one of many creators including Steven Crowder, Dave Rubin and others&nbsp;who make up what was once referred to as the "intellectual dark web," a group of right-wing pundits who challenged liberal and democratic beliefs. Many of these creators including Shapiro himself have disavowed the alt-right movement and white supremacist movements, yet <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf">studies show</a>&nbsp;their content is often a direct pipeline to online alt-right communities.&nbsp;</span>Conservative media outlet Newsmax also recently received warning that it could face a defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems for false claims that the company helped rig the election against Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Facebook has made repeated attempts to curb misinformation on the platform, from implementing machine learning to identify false stories to investigating the accuracy of viral stories like the Hunter Biden laptop scandal itself, but to little avail. Misinformation and extreme content is as prevalent on the platform under the new Biden administration as it was during election season last year, and Facebook is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">only now beginning to restrict</a> the presence of political content in users' newsfeeds overall.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Facebook announced that it would <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">remove all news content</a> from the platform in Australia in response to a proposed law which would require the company to pay publishers for every article posted on Facebook. In it, Facebook stated that the company's business gain is minimal, and that news makes up less than 4% of what appears in users' news feeds. However, Facebook did not provide a definition of what it considers to be "news" content. Posts from Bongino, Shapiro and others may not be considered strictly "news" by Facebook, but they often dress themselves up as&nbsp;such, looking nearly indistinguishable visually from average news articles. To their followers, Bongino's and Shapiro's posts are viewed as more credible than if they came from a mainstream media outlet — A 2020 survey from Pew Research Center found that one in five U.S. adults get their news primarily through social media, and that these adults are typically less informed or more susceptible&nbsp;to misinformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the 4% figure is correct, Facebook pages that post political or news content made up for 17 of the top 20 performing pages during the recorded period. Fox News, which can be considered a&nbsp;news source by most standards, is the second-most popular page on Facebook in terms of link performance. Regardless of whether Facebook has a significant business benefit from news content or not, the prevalence and success of it on the platform is enough to support entire businesses and ecosystems, like Bongino's and other "intellectual dark web" figures.</p>
<p>Bongino himself isn’t sure why he’s so popular on Facebook. “We don’t use bots. We don’t even advertise much on Facebook,” Bongino told Roose in an October interview. “If I told you I spent 10 minutes on analytics over the past year, I’d be lying.”</p>
<p>Much of Bongino’s content plays into the narrative that conservatives are being silenced by politicians and tech platforms. When Twitter banned Donald Trump’s account on January 8, Bongino was wrapped up in the crossfire. His account was suspended for 12 hours, which prompted him to leave the platform entirely in an act of protest. Bongino told Roose that he is preparing to be removed from Facebook for ideological reasons as well, and Facebook's recent decision to curb the amount of political content in newsfeeds may end up denting Bongino's empire. But in the meantime, he and his fellow pundits are thriving and have a near-complete control over which links get the …</p></section></div></div>

</p>

<p><em>Package, dependency and environment management for any
language—Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++,
FORTRAN, and more.</em></p>
<p>Conda is an open source package management system and environment
management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda
quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies.
Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments
on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it
can package and distribute software for any language.</p>
<p>Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages.
If you need a package that requires a different version of
Python, you do not need to switch to a different environment
manager, because conda is also an environment manager. With just
a few commands, you can set up a totally separate environment to
run that different version of Python, while continuing to run
your usual version of Python in your normal environment.</p>
<p>In its default configuration, conda can install and manage the
thousand packages at <a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/">repo.anaconda.com</a> that are built, reviewed
and maintained by Anaconda®.</p>
<p>Conda can be combined with continuous integration systems such
as Travis CI and AppVeyor to provide frequent, automated testing
of your code.</p>
<p>The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of
Anaconda and Miniconda.</p>
<p>Conda is also included in <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/enterprise/">Anaconda Enterprise</a>, which provides on-site enterprise
package and environment management for Python, R, Node.js, Java and other
application stacks. Conda is also available on <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/conda">conda-forge</a>,
a community channel. You may also get conda on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>,
but that approach may not be as up to date.</p>

		<p>As the Scott vs. The NYTs saga continues to unfold, one thing that stands out to me is the bipartisan nature of the criticism against the NYTs, as it is not just conservatives who have a bone to pick with the liberal media. The <em>Times’</em> attempt to dox Scott, and after that failed, smear him 8 months later, has seriously eroded, possibly irreparably, the reputation and credibility of the NYTs among a potentially large readership, in the thousands. </p>
<p>Even liberals agree that selective enforcement of the rules and editorial guidelines (such as who counts as a public figure, vs who is afforded the privilege of anonymity) is unfair. There is also the pearl clutching and sanctimonious moralizing by the NYTs, and the liberal media in general, as self-ordained arbiters of who is allowed to associate with whom. One must not speak of Charles Murray but in a negative light, or else one implicitly condones everything Dr. Murray believes in or has said (or even allegedly implied, as racism, according to the media, expresses itself not by one’s actions but rather by one’s implicit motives).  Scott mentioning Dr. Murray in passing without without categorically disavowing him, means Scott agrees with the implication that racial IQ differences imply that blacks are inferior to whites. Yes, this syllogism betrays logic, but this is how a smear piece works. Reason and impartiality are discarded to advance an ulterior agenda. </p>
<p>Should Scott have known he was being set up, or any of the other people interviewed in the article (yes, you too David D. Friedman)? I don’t know. It is understandable how Scott, David, and others were fooled. We want to believe that the media is honest, as ‘freedom of the press’ has been ingrained from an early age as an ‘American virtue’, and by associating the media  with the ‘goodness’ of the Constitution, it is understandable how one would be inclined to believe that the media would not abuse this great right it has been bestowed. </p>
<p>The liberal media fails to grasp, deaf to criticism and ensconced in its ideological bubble, how much their sententiousness and moralizing is disliked, even by its intended audience. It is not about where the NYTs stands on the issues per say, or, to put it politely, its creative interpretation of reality–whether it is the touted unfailing efficacy of mask wearing and social distancing, the ‘inevitability’ of Hillary in 2016, that Trump knowingly conspired with Russia, that Russian Twitter and Facebook troll bots pushing ‘fake news’ doomed Hillary despite her inevitability, that gender and racial discrepancies in science achievement must be due to sexism and racism, how <em>The Joker</em> is an ‘incel propaganda movie’ that would inspire mass shootings, or that Trump called all Mexicans ‘rapists and drug dealers’ and praised Nazis at Charlottesville as ‘good people’–but how the issues are framed as a false dichotomy between good (the media) and evil (those who have the gall to question the narrative–be it the efficacy of masks and other Covid guidelines, the purported existence of structural racism, or the veracity and integrity of the 2020 U.S. presidential election results), as opposed to people just merely holding differing viewpoints, which can be opposed by the intellectual merit or lack thereof of such  beliefs, not by the perceived goodness or badness of whoever holds them. Former Vox journalist Matthew Yglesias has a popular SubStack titled ‘slow boring’. That is how reporting should be–slow and boring–not a moral crusade.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi all,</p><p>The Dev brown-bag session of Feb 20th has been postponed.</p><p>Instead of finding a replacement, I am going to dare the whole Dev team to start and finish a work related challenge within a working day.</p><p>This is not a hackathon. You will be expected to work 8 hours, and it is actual work.</p><p>But you will need to work as a team, so if you decide to sign up for the challenge, you will need to make yourself available to the team 8am to 5pm Amsterdam time on Feb 20th, with a 12pm-1pm lunch break. Your colleges will expect that you accommodate your personal live chores around the team schedule.</p><p>The schedule will be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>0800: Everybody is ready in the “war room”, coffee in hand.<br></li>
    <li>0801-0830: Dan dares you to … I will explain the challenge here and then disappear.<br></li>
    <li>0831-1640: Team argues about approach.</li>
    <li>1641-1644: Team rushes to finish something.</li>
    <li>1645-1700: Dan shows up again. We celebrate/cry/curse together.</li>
  </ul><p>I happen to be in Amsterdam that day, so I will jump in and out, and generally not available.</p><p>The activity is voluntary, but if you sign up for it, you are making a commitment to the team. Note that the challenge is not known until the day. Do not ask me beforehand “Would my skill set be useful? Would this be the best use of my time?”. I dare you to help the team achieve the challenge in the best way you can.</p><p>If you are willing to participate please reply with “How do you dare!”.</p><p>As always, open for questions/suggestions/comments or other pledges.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Dan</p>
</blockquote><h2>People</h2><p>Out of 13 people in the Dev team, seven replied with:</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day4/how-dare-you.gif" alt="how dare you"></p><p>Neither UX nor the Product Managers enlisted. <em>Why not?</em></p><p>Seven people joined, two dropped the day before, and when the challenge was revealed, one silently disappeared. </p><p>Four brave souls to face the challenge…</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day4/four-musketeers.jpg" alt="four musketeers"></p><h2>Challenge</h2><p>The proposed challenge was to move one of our existing applications to <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">blue/green deployments</a>.</p><p>We already had the blue/green experience with another application, and we loved it. This will be an opportunity to spread the love to other teams.</p><p>The main piece of work was changing how the application stored user uploaded images. We were using a Kubernetes PersistentDisk, which at that point in Google Kubernetes Engine meant that we could not have more than one instance of the application running at a given time. </p><p>The app was build on Django which has a nice <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/files/storage/">File storage abstraction</a> with a <a href="https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/gcloud.html">Google Cloud Storage implementation</a> implementation. So in theory, the work was to change the Django configuration and migrate the existing user images to Google Cloud Storage. </p><p>As this was the most risky part, the previous week I did a proof of concept to make sure that it actually worked.</p><p>And it did. Hooray for abstractions!</p><p>The other big pieces of work were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a migration plan and script for the files.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste a bunch of Kubernetes yaml from the other blue/green application. A piece of cake.</li>
</ol><h2>The result</h2><p>The day was an astounding success, if the objective was to experiment all the dysfunctions of a software project within one day:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The work was poorly estimated:
  <ul>
    <li>We finished the work afterwards, and it was way more work than a team of four can handle in a day.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>The work was estimated by the “Product Owner” (myself), not the team executing it.</li>
  <li>Jump to doing, not enough planning:
  <ul>
    <li>The team had to restart once because there was no initial plan and all was too confusing.</li>
    <li>I have the feeling that a product manager would have pushed for a proper plan before starting.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>One person was late to the kickoff meeting:
  <ul>
    <li>Required the rest of the team to explain the job again, wasting valuable time.</li>
    <li>The late person got the requirements second hand, which ended up causing …</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Unclear requirements (and strong personalities):
  <ul>
    <li>The person that was late single-handedly transformed the objective of the challenge from <em>“lets do something productive in one day”</em> to <em>“lets learn about mob programming and Python. There is no need to deliver.”</em></li>
    <li>This one still baffles me, but I wrote the requirements, so maybe is what Product Owners feel every day.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Devs <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/04/15/on-the-importance-of-clear-communication-in-devops/#content">not asking for clarification</a>, just assume what the client wants:
  <ul>
    <li>Nobody asked the Product Owner about the unclear requirements.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law">Adding people to a late project …</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>I am happy that several people that has not signed up for the challenge jumped during the day to see if they could help, but given that none stayed, they were just a distraction that delayed the team further.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Leaky abstractions</a> and unexpected technical issues:
  <ul>
    <li>Django’s File storage abstraction happens to be a leaky abstraction, which means that the Google Cloud Storage worked slightly differently than the Local Storage implementation.</li>
    <li>The proof of concept tested the file upload code path that worked in Google Cloud Storage.</li>
    <li>The team stumbled on the file upload code path that did not work.</li>
    <li>The team completely derailed here:
    <ul>
      <li>It spent several hours mob debugging a piece of Python code.</li>
      <li>Did I mention that out of four, there was just one Python developer?</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>I have the feeling that a product manager would have cut losses and moved to team past this hurdle.</li>
    <li>Why the team did not ask the Product Owner about the proof of concept?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Improvement work not important enough:
  <ul>
    <li>Not caused by the challenge, but the shortcomings of our development workflow became painfully obvious, specially in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>No easy way of creating a new test environment to experiment safely.</li>
      <li>Builds taking 20 minutes are not fine if you have 8 hours to do the work.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Siloed knowledge:
  <ul>
    <li>Copy and pasting a bunch of Kubernetes yaml files from an existing blue/green application is a piece of cake … if you have designed the original solution, implemented it, and debugged it in production.</li>
    <li>Tweaking a <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm chart</a> to deploy a custom-built version of the application is a piece of cake … if you have designed the original Helm chart, implemented it, and debugged it in production.</li>
    <li>Reminder for all of us: programming is easy, if you have been doing it for 20 years.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol><h3>Was it really that bad?</h3><p>Well, at least there was no scope creep!</p><p>The fix for the leaky abstraction was useful when we later implemented the work.</p><p>Three of the participants said that they would do it again. I did not need to ask the forth one: </p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day4/gosh.png" alt="gosh"></p><p>Several hours of mob debugging on an unknown language and platform can do this to anybody. </p><h2>Doing it again?</h2><p>Not how it is explained here. </p><p>First, I would not mix people from different teams. This can be a great tool to debug a dysfunctional team, as the team can see within a day what their pain points are, and the feedback loop is fast (daily).</p>
<blockquote><p>If it hurts, do it more frequently, and bring the pain forward.” <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/jezhumble">Jez Humble</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a></cite></p>
</blockquote><p>Second, our teams are remote and in different time zones and/or schedules. Everybody working a whole day together is an exception, not the norm. Collocated teams may be required.</p><p>One year later, I have not dared to run it again.</p><h2>Lessons</h2><p>As usual, if you have time to reflect, you can find plenty of lessons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There is nothing new under the sun. <a href="https://twitter.com/johncutlefish">John Cutler</a> blogged about <a href="https://cutle.fish/blog/one-day-sprints">One Day Sprints</a> in 2017.</li>
  <li>The experiment made obvious the value of cross-functional teams, an <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/customer.html">on-site customer</a> should be part of that team.</li>
  <li>Work in progress of one is very difficult.</li>
  <li>Communication is messy, repeating things twice is not enough.</li>
  <li>Short feedback loops are precious.</li>
</ol><p>But the most important lesson (or should I say reminder?) is that you cannot throw a bunch of people into a project and call them a <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2021/01/20/team-topologies-summary/#content">team</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Logs are inherently risky: small mistakes can lead to sensitive data appearing in plaintext in places they shouldn’t. No organization can eliminate the possibility that secrets will be logged, but they can better manage the risk by adding safeguards into their systems. </p><p>This post details one approach we took at Transcend to help attack this problem, by declaring fields as sensitive or not in our type system. </p><p>We found that many avenues for making mistakes with handling secrets have disappeared, and our confidence in the safety of our logs has gone up considerably. </p><p>Building in protections like these can add extra work for developers, but they can be powerful tools for increasing developer confidence that when they make mistakes the damage can be minimized.</p><h2 id="starting-from-a-place-of-acceptance">Starting from a place of acceptance</h2><p>In the past few years, we’ve seen <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter log unhashed user passwords</a>, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/keeping-passwords-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Facebook logged tens of millions of unhashed user passwords</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19975378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google logged unhashed GSuite user passwords</a>, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/subiquity/+bug/1878115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ubuntu’s server installer logged passwords</a>, and many other cases of similar incidents occurred. These incidents are extremely damaging to user trust and can require extensive cleanup to prevent identity theft.</p><p>Despite the severity, it seems that whenever these incidents occur, online forums are filled with comments from developers who couldn’t possibly let this sort of mistake happen in their systems, and that Twitter, Facebook, Google, Ubuntu, and others must be worse at architecting systems than they are. </p><p>This could be true in some instances, but brushing off these cases as elementary feels disingenuous to the brilliant DevOps work each of these companies has contributed to the open source community. </p><p>If we can accept that developers occasionally make mistakes while also accepting that these breaches are unacceptable, we can conclude that safeguards that would protect against similar mistakes while simultaneously minimizing the damage would be beneficial.</p><h2 id="how-does-log-redaction-happen-now">How does log redaction happen now?</h2><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/6FzW1Zpljf19ug17t8pezc/57f83cba34a05df9ea8fd9d12c225471/logblog_Log_Lifecycle__1_.jpg" alt="Log Lifecycle"></p><figcaption>The Log Lifecycle</figcaption></div><p>The above diagram shows how many production systems manage logs at a high level, across a variety of stacks and languages. </p><p>There is some application code that contains log statements, and those logs are picked up and enhanced by a daemon service, which then forwards the logs to a log collection service, that allows you to interact with those logs.</p><p>Throughout this pipeline, redaction can happen at a number of stages:</p><ul><li>Application code that determines what values should be logged.</li><li>Logging libraries <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer log levels to discard debug-level log statments</a></li><li>Many log libraries <a href="https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/redaction.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer APIs to redact certain log paths of structured logs</a></li><li>Log Aggregation services <a href="https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/modify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer APIs for rewriting or removing keys that could have sensitive values</a></li><li>Log collection services <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/guide/control-sensitive-logs-data/#make-sensitive-logs-un-queryable-in-datadog-until-they-age-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">offer ways to make existing logs unsearchable if they have sensitive data</a></li></ul><p>All of these levels offer a filtering system where logs that make it to the collection services shouldn’t contain any sensitive data, but holes are still possible in each step:</p><ul><li>In your application code, your team could approve a PR that adds a sensitive field to an object that previously did not have sensitive data, without being aware of where that data is logged or consumed.</li><li>While many companies review all of their own code used in production, they may not stay up to date on all logging changes in third party dependencies. A three-level deep npm dependency that changed its error message to include more information may end up unintentionally logging more of an object than you thought it would.</li><li>The third party libraries you use can have different definitions of what information is acceptable to log at certain log levels.</li><li>Your log aggregation redaction regexes might miss user emails or other fields that use non-standard or international formats.</li><li>A misspelling in a field name or log level could lead to fields not being redacted when you think they should have.</li><li>Sometimes error messages or stack traces can add wrappers around your structured logs making path-based redaction difficult.</li><li>Log collection services de-indexing sensitive data should only be used as a last resort. If your data is in plaintext in an external system, it could have already been compromised.</li></ul><p>As you move to the right in the diagram, getting closer to the log collection services, the filtering becomes more of a last resort approach. They are still good to have, but ultimately, it’s as you move to the left towards application code where the most effective best practices live. Your application code is where you likely have the most robust code reviews and can most easily enforce best practices like only logging the minimum number of fields.</p><p>By carefully picking what fields we want to log in structured log formats, we can have quite strong confidence that we won’t log sensitive data. </p><p>After all, the easiest way to ensure your fluentd regex that redacts social security numbers doesn’t miss a value is to just not log social security numbers!</p><p>But we’d be foolish to think that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others don’t use structured logs with typed fields. There’s still one problem left: many structured logs have <code>string</code> as some field types. And strings can contain sensitive data.</p><p>This last step, and the one the rest of the article will focus on, is adding secret metadata to our typing system so that we can try to prevent these freeform <code>string</code> fields from presenting any data we don’t explicitly mention should be presented.</p><h2 id="redacting-at-the-type-declaration-level">Redacting at the type declaration level</h2><p><em>A quick note: In this blog, we’ll be focusing on Typescript and <a href="https://github.com/transcend-io/secret-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our open-source <code>@transcend-io/secret-value</code> library available on npm/Github Packages</a>, but the concepts can be used across a variety of languages.</em></p><p>In order to help ensure that sensitive values are not included in log statements, we’ve created a new type <code>Secret</code> that prevents its values from being added to logs. The easiest way to show how is with this example:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>Secret</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>`@transcend-io/secret-value`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> secret </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Secret</span><span>(</span><span>`some secret value`</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>secret</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>We wrap the string <code>some secret value</code> into a <code>Secret&lt;string&gt;</code> type that will appear as <code>[redacted]</code> whether you <code>console.log</code> it, <code>JSON.stringify</code> it, <code>secret.valueOf()</code> it, interpolate it into a string, or do just about anything else to it you could imagine in JavaScript.</p><p>If you want to modify the value of the secret without unwrapping it, you can use the <code>map</code> function common to many functional wrappers like <code>const secretLenth = secret.map(rawValue =&gt; rawValue.length)</code>.</p><p>When you want to use the value stored inside the secret, you can use <code>secret.release()</code> to get the value <code>some secret value</code> back out.</p><p>The API is minimal, but it’s meant to be this way. This wrapper provides a few benefits:</p><ul><li>It provides internal documentation to your developers that a value is sensitive, in an enforceable way that comments cannot do.</li><li>It ensures that if the <code>Secret</code> value is included in any log statement, its value will not appear.</li><li>It shifts the responsibility to determine if a value is sensitive or not from the person writing the log statements to the person defining the field.</li><li>It encourages developers to consider if it is safe to release secrets and pass their raw values to external systems, as most external libraries won’t take <code>Secret&lt;T&gt;</code> types. As an example, you might be fine sending most of your values to the <code>left-pad</code> library on npm, but maybe you should stick to mutating your Secret values in-house to prevent cases where a deep dependency on npm could add a log statement that would log out your sensitive value.</li></ul><p>This paradigm can also be extended in a couple of different ways:</p><ul><li>You could add telemetry to track who is releasing secret values, when they did it, and why they did it.</li><li>Instead of printing <code>[redacted]</code> you could hash the secret values, which is what <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit#sensitive-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hashicorp does with their Vault audit logs</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2><p>At Transcend, our business is protecting users’ personal data. This requires careful thought and care to go into our application code, infrastructure, and end-to-end encryption pipelines. Keeping sensitive information out of logs is just one part of this process, but using <code>Secret&lt;T&gt;</code> has made this one part much easier.</p></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the first day at your new job and you're trying to familiarize yourself with the codebase. You're going to be spending a good amount of time here so you down that coffee and dive in. Where do you start?</p><p>You've already been added to the company's GitHub organization (your manager is prepared). On github.com, you click around directories and files in your browser. Which file do you open?</p><p>GitHub's navigation is relatively limited so you clone the repo locally. You activate your personal toolkit by opening your IDE of choice. You have shortcuts for finding in project and jumping to definition. You can easily blame a line of code and browse source control. <em>See also </em><em><a href="https://github.com/conwnet/github1s">github1s</a></em><em> and </em><em><a href="https://sourcegraph.com/">Sourcegraph</a></em><em>.</em></p><p>Still, the question remains. Which file do you open first? <code>App.tsx</code> seems like a good starting place.</p><h3>Scavenger Hunt</h3><p>Rather than random walk through the codebase, I find it useful to have a goal, even if artificial. I come up with a statement — there MUST be a place where X happens — and then try to find it.</p><ul><li>In React, there must be a place where it manipulates the DOM, probably with DOM APIs (appendChild? innerHTML?). How does it decide what DOM manipulations to perform?</li></ul><ul><li>In this app, there must be a place where it fetches data from the server. Maybe a fetch call? GraphQL? or some other abstraction.</li></ul><p>A lot of engineering is looking for things.</p><h3>There's a reason</h3><p>Why does this line of code exist? Every line of code exists for a (good or bad) reason. A good codebase makes this an easier question to answer. Maybe there are useful comments nearby. Maybe the associated commits are well structured. Or the code is well structured.</p><p>Jump to definition and find references are table stakes language service features at this point. What are other useful language features for reading code?</p><h3>Trace the code</h3><p>What happens when the code runs? What functions are being called? What are the key operations? Stepping through a debugger line by line is too tedious though.</p><p>I like this idea of interactive flamegraphs. Today, reading codebases is usually bottom-up (start at lines of code). What if we had a top-down approach? Provide an overview and drill into the interesting bits.</p><h2>Documentation</h2><p>The repo you're browsing has been blessed with a quality <code>README.md</code>. There are instructions on how to set up and get the code running. There's even a sentence about each folder and an architectural overview. This is your first exposure to a massive codebase. These small investments pay dividends.</p><p>When I think of "code documentation", I think of ones written for consumers of an API or library. Documentation for the codebase is usually inline and autogenerated. See examples like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html">rustdoc</a> and <a href="https://typedoc.org/api/">TypeDoc</a>. I was pleasantly surprised with the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Architectural-Overview">wiki pages on the TypeScript codebase</a> although non-inline documentation inevitably gets stale.</p><h2>Guides</h2><p>It'd be nice if someone sat down and gave you a tour of the codebase. A video would be great but impossible to update. Though there's value in wandering and figuring things out yourself, pointers can really accelerate the process. There are ideas that are not visible at the lines of code level, like how pieces of the system interact with each other.</p><p>I like the approach of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/codetour">CodeTour</a>, a VSCode extension that allows you to record and playback guided walkthroughs. The tours are just JSON that live within the codebase.</p><p>At Facebook, I designed the first assignment of bootcamp, the first few weeks for new engineers. It involved building an internal webpage and something with <a href="https://pusheen.com/">Pusheen</a>. You went through the code review process and shipped it. I don't know if this is still around but I thought it was a fun and gentle way to approach a codebase.</p><p>Of course, you can also do a real first task. Instead of randomly browsing around, a task provides a lens and direction to understanding a codebase. The figure-it-out-as-you-go approach.</p><h2>People</h2><p>Working in codebases with contributors &gt; 1 is a social activity.</p><p>An investigation that takes you hours may take someone else minutes to answer. Maybe you wander around a codebase jotting down questions and ask in batch. These questions/answers can be recorded for future explorers.</p><p>All future contributors go through the same process. See the codebase for the first time and build a mental map of how it works. This learning happens asynchronously but can we make tools to turn this into a shared experience?</p><p>Pair programming is cool. It often results in knowledge transfer (tips, commentary) that wouldn't be prompted otherwise.</p><h2>Tooling</h2><p>All this is in context of my exploration of tools for working with code. We know that there are better tools than Notepad for reading code. Syntax highlighting is nice. Jump to definition. Source control integration. What else can we leverage? Are there interesting user interfaces?</p><p>What if we viewed code as data? See <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamarous Toolkit</a> and Pete Vilter's <a href="https://petevilter.me/post/datalog-typechecking/">post on Codebase as Database</a>.</p><p>What would a map of the codebase look like? Google Maps? A graphviz diagram? A spreadsheet?</p><p>I'd love to hear from you on <a href="https://twitter.com/_paulshen">Twitter</a>, where I spend time on questions like these.</p></div></div>]]>

February 17, 2021 | https://adnaan.badr.in/blog/2021/01/25/the-reports-of-devopss-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adnaan.badr.in/blog/2021/01/25/the-reports-of-devopss-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>| The Reports of Devops’s death are greatly exaggerated - <strong>Not</strong> said by Mark Twain</p>
<p>“Devops is Dead”, is a claim I have heard in hushed conversations and several blog posts over the last couple of years, and it’s turning quickly into more than whispers. However, like most extreme claims this too is grossly exaggerated. There has been a change to the status quo, but it’s rather a transformation than a termination. For good reasons, devops has evolved into a different discipline than before.</p>
<p>The term “devops” itself has a lot of meanings. Devops can refer to either a role or a process for developing and releasing software. Here we are talking about the role which used to specialise in operating systems, monitoring and CI/CD tools with an 80:20 division of work. 80 percent of infra work was done by devops specialists while 20 percent of work(mostly tinkering with config) was handled by developers. For instance,  at <a href="https://myntra.com/">Myntra</a> way back in 2015, we used to provision VMs in our “cloud” data center by triggering a script manually with the required configuration options. Now in a compute environment like Google Kubernetes Engine, provisioning new VMs happens automatically behind the scenes. A big chunk of that 80 percent work has moved to Cloud Services Providers(AWS, GCP, Azure, Github, Gitlab etc.).</p>
<h2 id="you-know-what-tech-roles-do--they-evolve">You know what tech roles do ? They evolve.</h2>
<p>Every tech role is in a state of constant flux. This is fairly obvious. Although things get muddled when you have organisations latching on to job titles to make hiring easier. The Devops role too has evolved to keep up with a changing infrastructure landscape.</p>
<p>A few observations related to this evolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tech stack is just a bunch of yamls.</li>
<li>Deep operating system and networking knowledge is no longer at premium: Docker and k8s ate that lunch.</li>
<li>Deep knowledge of the inner workings of a particular Cloud Provider(AWS Specialist, GCP Specialist) is still at premium since this can lead to better design and cheaper costs. But the cloud providers know they have a complex ecosystem and are constantly releasing better documentation, better UI controls etc. Think about this: why have a few niche customers(infra specialists), when every software developer is a potential customer.</li>
<li>Configuring infrastructure is now like writing mini-apps for the Cloud API(aws, gcp, azure) using terraform, deployment manager, cloud formation etc.</li>
<li>Configuring observability infrastructure is also done over an API. See above. Cloud providers have made available open source SDKs to connect to the monitoring stack. It has become a lot easier for developers to bring in observability than before.</li>
<li>Permissions management is also an API concern. Although there is still some <em>devops</em> work required to make it work across multiple services( think GCP + Github + Gitlab).</li>
<li>Designing and building CI/CD pipelines have moved in the hands of developers: Github Actions, Gitlab, CircleCI, <a href="https://tekton.dev/">https://tekton.dev/</a> etc. have made writing pipelines less complicated(as compared to Jenkins) and now its just yamls down to the turtles.</li>
<li>Infrastructure performance is now a cost concern. One can always scale.</li>
<li>Fully integrated solutions like heroku, netlify, vercel, digitalocean apps are removing the low to medium scale website market from the equation.</li>
<li>Devops as a process of delivering software has always been an organisational concern mostly led by the devops specialists. But since their specialised skills are no longer required, the process drivers can come from any discipline.</li>
<li>Devops as teachers of deep infrastructure skills for developers still remains. But if the specialised skills are not being practiced as much, how long can they keep that crown ?</li>
<li>Devops as budget keepers are being replaced with cost analysis tools which notify app owners to optimise their usage.</li>
<li>Devops still practice designing infra architecture. At some organisations, this is getting outsourced to cloud services support teams and consultancies.</li>
<li>The request-response cycle is now a pull request-merge cycle due to the adoption of gitops. The devops team creates the self-service tools and gets out of the way. The devops engineer is now yet another approver.</li>
</ul>
<p>The devops role has certainly transformed into someone who creates and tends to configurations. Since the complexity has moved to managing increasingly complex configurations, we are seeing the rise of a different kind of discipline and the tech which goes with it. A few examples from last few years:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">pulumi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jkcfg.github.io/#/">jkcfg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS CDK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk">Terraform CDK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python">Google Cloud SDK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The common theme in the above is usage of full-fledged programming languages(typescript, python, golang etc.) to define and manage infrastructure. Not just that, we are also seeing the rise of new smaller data templating languages especially created for configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jsonnet.org/">jsonnet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cuelang.org/">cuelang</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">dhall-lang</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark(python dialect)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="you-cannot-configure-what-you-do-not-understand">You cannot configure what you do not understand</h2>
<p>Although high level constructs are now available to treat infrastructure resources like yet another software object, the abstraction is not complete. For e.g. one still needs to understand when to use k8s deployment vs k8s statefulset, to configure CPU resource limits one still needs to have an understanding of the runtime, to create VPCs, one still needs to know about subnetworks and CIDR blocks. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS CDK</a> aims to solve this problem by introducing <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html">constructs</a> with sane defaults. We have done something similar at <a href="https://taxfix.de/">Taxfix</a> for Kubernetes and Monitoring(watch out this space for a post on our custom deployment SDK ! ) The knowledge of low level concepts will still be required at some level, but the low level complexity will keep moving towards abstractions built by the behemoths(k8s, container runtimes, GCP, AWS, Azure.). I wonder how long before we start talking about infrastructure solely in terms of software objects, and the languages and tools which can help manage them. IMO we are getting pretty close.</p>
<h2 id="the-devops-role-is-dead">The Devops Role is Dead</h2>
<p>Ok <em>maybe</em> devops as a traditional centralised role is dead or at least on its deathbed. For many organisations this is not true, <strong>yet</strong>. It’s transforming into a discipline where cloud-infra focused engineers work in tandem with application focused engineers to deliver software quickly and efficiently. These “cloud-infra” focused engineers practice classical software principles and full-fledged languages. With respect to their traits, such engineers are closer to application platform engineers than to a traditional devops engineer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, devops as a process is alive and kicking while <em>also</em> evolving. The adoption of Site Reliability Engineering even in medium-sized companies is inline with the aforesaid premise of seeing infra problems as software problems. SRE as a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/sre-vs-devops-competing-standards-or-close-friends">specific implementation</a> of the principles of devops, is pushing infrastructure engineering closer to application engineering.</p>
<p>Following are the activities I have seen while practicing a similar role at <a href="https://taxfix.de/">Taxfix</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use terraform, terraform cdk, pulumi like tools to set up compute, network and datastore infra.</li>
<li>Generate kubernetes manifests using pulumi, jsonnet, jkcfg, AWS CDK or similar tools.</li>
<li>Generate monitoring configuration for a Cloud Provider or third-parties like grafana, prometheus etc using SDKs.</li>
<li>Write or generate CI/CD manifests. Include build steps for code quality, security etc.</li>
<li>Develop a gitops tool to distribute permissions and secrets.</li>
<li>Develop a gitops tools to add/remove frequently provisioned resources, e.g. Buckets, Pubsub Queues.</li>
<li>Develop a gitops tool to automate oncall scheduling and paging.</li>
<li>Develop platform tools to standardise platform task, e.g: webhook tunnel, notification schedule, API gateways etc.</li>
<li>Integrate or develop tools to ensure continuous delivery using feature flags.</li>
<li>Write maintainable, testable code while using established good practices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-bright-new-day-a-new-shiny-new-title">A bright new day, A new shiny new title</h2>
<p>How about a new title for the devops role then ? Just flinging out some respectable-sounding titles here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure Tools/Apps Developer/Engineer</li>
<li>Cloud Native Tools/Apps Developer/Engineer</li>
<li>Configuration Ops/ConfigOps</li>
<li>Developer Tools/Apps Engineer</li>
<li>Cloud Native Specialist</li>
<li>Cloud Config Ops</li>
<li>PlumbOps</li>
<li>Application Platform Engineer(Infrastructure)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite comfortable with the title, “Devops” too, it’s got a nice ring to it. Of course what it means is constantly evolving.</p>
<h2 id="dont-write-an-obituary-just-yet">Don’t write an obituary just yet</h2>
<p>Far from being dead, devops has grown into an exciting discipline. A few things to highlight before we end:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure is increasingly represented by software objects.</li>
<li>You cannot configure what you do not understand. Low-level specialists are still needed to design systems well.</li>
<li>Devops engineers are now software engineers with infra chops. Maybe we need new titles to go with the evolved responsibilities of the devops role.</li>
</ul>
<p>As devops practitioners, we are no longer just “knob-fiddlers”, now we program the knob to self-fiddle.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift#cranelift-code-generator">Cranelift</a> is a code generator written in the Rust programming language that aims to be a fast code generator, which outputs machine code that runs at reasonable speeds.</p>
<p>The Cranelift compilation model consists in compiling functions one by one, holding extra information about external entities, like external functions, memory addresses, and so on. This model allows for concurrent and parallel compilation of individual functions, which supports the goal of fast compilation. It was designed this way to allow for just-in-time (JIT) compilation of WebAssembly binary code in Firefox, although its scope has broadened a bit. Nowadays it is used in a few different WebAssembly runtimes, including <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime#wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> and <a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a>, but also as an alternative backend for Rust debug compilation, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">cg_clif</a>.</p>
<p>A classic compiler design usually includes running a parser to translate the source to some form of intermediate representations, then run optimization passes onto them, then feeds this to the machine code generator.</p>
<p>This blog post focuses on the final step, namely the concepts that are involved in code generation, and what they map to in Cranelift. To make things more concrete, we'll take a specific instruction, and see how it's translated, from its creation down to code generation. At each step of the process, I'll provide a short (<em>ahem</em>) high-level explanation of the concepts involved, and I'll show what they map to in Cranelift, using the example instruction. While this is not a tutorial detailing how to add new instructions in Cranelift, this should be an interesting read for anyone who's interested in compilers, and this could be an entry point if you're interested in hacking on the Cranelift <code>codegen</code> crate.</p>
<p>This is our plan for this blog post: each squared box represents data, each
rounded box is a process. We're going to go through each of them below.</p>
<p>

    clif[Optimized CLIF];
    vcode[VCode];
    final_vcode[Final VCode];
    machine_code[Machine code artifacts];

</p>


<p>Compilers use <strong>intermediate representations</strong> (<em>IR</em>) to represent source code. Here we're interested in representations of the <em>data flow</em>, that is instructions themselves and only that. The IRs contain information about the instructions themselves, their operands, type specialization information, and any additional metadata that might be useful. IRs usually map to a certain level of abstraction, and as such, they are useful for solving different problems that require different levels of abstraction. Their shape (which data structures) and numbers often have a huge impact on the performance of the compiler itself (that is, how fast it is at compiling).</p>
<p>In general, most programming languages use IRs internally, and yet, these are invisible to the programmers. The reason is that source code is usually first <em>parsed</em> (tokenized, verified) and then translated into an IR. The <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, aka AST, is one such IR representing the source code itself, in a format that's very close to the source code itself. Since the raison d'être of Cranelift is to be a code generator, having a text format is secondary, and only useful for testing and debugging purposes. That's why embedders directly create and manipulate Cranelift's IR.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Cranelift has two IRs to represent the function's code:</p>
<ul>
<li>one external, high-level intermediate representation, called <strong>CLIF</strong> (for <em>Cranelift IR format</em>),</li>
<li>one internal, low-level intermediate representation called <strong>VCode</strong> (for <em>virtual-registerized code</em>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clif-ir"><a href="#clif-ir">CLIF IR</a></h2>
<p>CLIF is the IR that Cranelift embedders create and manipulate. It consists of high-level typed operations that are convenient to use and/or can be simply translated to machine code. It is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">static single assignment (SSA) form</a>: each value referenced by an operation (SSA value) is defined only once, and may have as many uses as desired. CLIF is practical to use and manipulate for classic compilers optimization passes (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion">LICM</a>), as it is generic over the target architecture which we're compiling to.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>An example of Rust code that would generate CLIF IR: using an IR builder, two constant 64-bits integer SSA values x and y are created, and then added together. The result is stored into the <code>sum</code> SSA value, which can then be consumed by other instructions.</p>
<p>The code for the IR builder we're manipulating above is automatically generated by the <code>cranelift-codegen</code> build script. The build script uses a domain specific <em>meta</em> language (DSL)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> that defines the instructions, their input and output operands, which input types are allowed, how the output type is inferred, etc. We won't take a look at this <em>today</em>: this is a bit too far from code generation, but this could be material for another blog post.</p>
<p>As an example of a full-blown CLIF generator, there is <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift/wasm">a crate</a> in the Cranelift project that allows translating from the WebAssembly binary format to CLIF. The Cranelift backend for Rustc uses its own CLIF generator that translates from one of the Rust compiler's IRs.</p>
<p>Finally, it's time to reveal what's going to be our running example! The Chosen One is the <code>iadd</code> CLIF operation, which allows to add two integers of any length together, with wrapping semantics. It is both simple to understand what it does, and exhibits interesting behaviors on the two architectures we're interested in. So, let's continue down the pipeline!</p>
<h2 id="vcode-ir"><a href="#vcode-ir">VCode IR</a></h2>
<p>Later on, the CLIF intermediate representation is <em>lowered</em>, i.e. transformed from a high-level one into a lower-level one. Here lower level means a form more specialized for a machine architecture. This lower IR is called <em>VCode</em> in Cranelift. The values it references are called <em>virtual registers</em> (more on the <em>virtual</em> bit below). They're not in SSA form anymore: each virtual register may be redefined as many times as we want. This IR is used to encode register allocation constraints and it guides machine code generation. As a matter of fact, since this information is tied to the machine code's representation itself, this IR is also target-specific: there's one flavor of VCode per each CPU architecture we're compiling to.</p>
<p>Let's get back to our example, that we're going to compile on two instruction set architectures:
- ARM 64-bits (aka aarch64), which is used in most mobile devices but start to become mainstream on laptops (Apple's Mac M1, some Chromebooks)
- Intel's x86 64-bits (aka x86_64, also abbreviated x64), which is used in most desktop and laptop machines).</p>
<p>An integer addition machine instruction on aarch64 will take three operands: two input operands (one of which must be a register), and another third output register operand. While on the x86_64 architecture, the equivalent instruction involves a total of two registers: one that is a read-only source register, and another that is an in-out modified register, containing both the second source and the destination register. We'll get back to this.</p>
<p>So considering <code>iadd</code>, let's look at (one of<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup>) the VCode instruction that's used to represent integer additions on aarch64 (as defined in <code>cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64/inst/mod.rs</code>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>/// An ALU operation with two register sources and a register destination.</span>
<span>AluRRR</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>alu_op</span>: <span>ALUOp</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>rd</span>: <span>Writable</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Reg</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>rn</span>: <span>Reg</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>rm</span>: <span>Reg</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>},</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Some details here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alu_op</code> defines the sub-opcode used in the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). It will be <code>AluOp::Add64</code> for a 64-bits integer addition.</li>
<li><code>rn</code> and <code>rm</code> are the conventional aarch64 names for the two input registers.</li>
<li><code>rd</code> is the destination register. See how it's marked as <code>Writable</code>, while the two others are not? <code>Writable</code> is a plain Rust wrapper that makes sure that we <em>can</em> statically differentiate read-only registers from writable registers; a neat trick that allows us to catch more issues at compile-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this information is directly tied to the machine code representation of an addition instruction on aarch64: each field is later used to select some bytes that will be generated during code generation.</p>
<p>As said before, the VCode is specific to each architecture, so x86_64 has a different VCode representation for the same instruction (as defined in <code>cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/mod.rs</code>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>/// Integer arithmetic/bit-twiddling: (add sub and or xor mul adc? sbb?) (32 64) (reg addr imm) reg</span>
<span>AluRmiR</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>is_64</span>: <span>bool</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>op</span>: <span>AluRmiROpcode</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>src</span>: <span>RegMemImm</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>    </span><span>dst</span>: <span>Writable</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Reg</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>},</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, the sub-opcode is defined as part of the <code>AluRmiROpcode</code> enum (the comment hints at which other x86 machine instructions are generated by this same VCode). See how there's only one <code>src</code> (source) register (or memory or immediate operand), while the instruction conceptually takes two inputs? That's because it's expected that the <code>dst</code> (destination) register is <em>modified</em>, that is, both read (so it's the second input operand) and written to (so it's the result register). In equivalent C code, the x86's add instruction doesn't actually do <code>a = b + c</code>. What it does is <code>a += b</code>, that is, one of the sources is <em>consumed</em> by the instruction. This is an artifact inherited from the design of older x86 machines in the 1970's, when instructions were designed around an accumulator model (and representing efficiently three operands in a CISC architecture would make the encoding larger and harder than it is).</p>
<h2 id="instruction-selection-lowering"><a href="#instruction-selection-lowering">Instruction selection (lowering)</a></h2>
<p>As said before, converting from the high-level IR (CLIF) to the low-level IR (VCode) is called lowering. Since VCode is target-dependent, this process is also target-dependent. That's where we consider which machine instructions get eventually used for a given CLIF opcode. There are many ways to achieve the same machine state results for given semantics, but some of these ways are faster than other, …</p></div></div>

<p>Which means, that if the pool has <strong>x</strong> tokens of asset <code>X</code> and <strong>y</strong> tokens of asset <code>Y</code>, then the pool will update its assets such that before and after the trade, $x \cdot y = k$.</p>
<p>$k$ is called the invariant (invariant = <em>thing that stays the same</em>).  For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>there are <strong>1000</strong> <code>X</code> tokens and <strong>5000</strong> <code>Y</code> tokens $x \cdot y = 5 \times 10^6$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somebody wants to buy <code>Y</code> tokens.  To do so, they deposit <strong>200</strong> <code>X</code> tokens into the pool.  After the 0.3% fee, <strong>199.4</strong> <code>X</code> tokens are added.  The pool now has:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1199.4</strong> <code>X</code> tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The invariant $k = 5 \times 10^6$ has to stay the same, so: $1199.4 \cdot y = 5 \times 10^6$ must be true.  We can therefore solve the equation and get: $y =  4168.75$ tokens.  In other words, to preserve the invariant $k$, $y = 5000$ needs to go down to $y = 4169.75$. The difference $5000-4168.75 = 831.25$ is how many <code>Y</code> tokens the trader will receive.</p>
<p><img src="https://alvarofeito.com/articles/curve/uniswap_curve.png" alt="uniswap 1/x"></p>
<h2 id="Price-Setting">Price Setting<a href="#Price-Setting">¶</a></h2><p>You may have noticed that the price was automatically set.  The trader deposited 200 <code>X</code> and got 831.25 <code>Y</code>, so the price is: 
$$\mathcal{P} = \frac{831.25}{200} \;\; Y/X$$</p>
<p>or $$\mathcal{P} = 4.16  \;\; Y/X $$</p>
<h2 id="Price-Updating">Price Updating<a href="#Price-Updating">¶</a></h2><p>What is the price if a new trader wants to trade another <strong>200</strong> <code>X</code> tokens for <code>Y</code> tokens?  Well, let's apply $x \cdot y = k$ again to find out:</p>
<p>The new state of the pool after the deposit is:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1199.4 + <strong>199.4</strong>) <code>X</code> tokens</p>
<p>4168.75 <code>Y</code> tokens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this time we need to solve $1398.8 \cdot y = 5 \times 10^6$.  the solution is $y = 3574.4$, so the second trader will get (<code>what_is_currently_in_the_Y_side</code> - <code>what_should_be_in_the_Y_side</code>) $= 4168.75-3574 = 594.75 $.  As you see, the second trader got less for her money.  The price was:</p><p>
$$\mathcal{P} = 2.97  \;\; Y/X $$</p><p><code>Y</code> got much more expensive after the first trade!  In some ways this makes sense.  In the first operation, somebody tried to buy $\frac{831}{5000} ~ 17\% $ of all <code>Y</code> tokens from the pool.  In the face of such high demand, the pool auto-adjusted the price accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="Price-Equation-&amp;-geometrical-interpretation">Price Equation &amp; geometrical interpretation<a href="#Price-Equation-&amp;-geometrical-interpretation">¶</a></h2><p>Notice that the price was calculated as $\mathcal{P} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.  In other words,</p><p>
$$\mathcal{P} = \frac{\textrm{how much was taken out}}{\textrm{how much was deposited}}$$</p><p>If we think of the $xy=k$ as a <em>curve</em>, the curve $y = \frac{k}{x}$, then $\mathcal{P} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is its gradient or, in the limit of small trades, the derivative:</p><p>
$$\mathcal{P} = \frac{d y}{d x}$$</p><p>This idea will come back later several times.</p>

<p>In the graph above, as trading occurs, and we have less <code>Y</code> in the pool, but more <code>X</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the tangent is shalow, you get less <code>Y</code> for your <code>X</code> (Y more expensive, low number)</li>
<li>if the tangent is steep, you get more <code>Y</code> for your <code>X</code> (Y is cheaper)</li>

<h2 id="Slippage">Slippage<a href="#Slippage">¶</a></h2><p>In a standard exchange, the order-book:
<img src="https://alvarofeito.com/articles/curve/order_book.png" alt="Order Book"></p>
<p>Allows us to read how the price will change (slippage) as we buy more and more of a token (travel up the curve).  This depends on the details of the price and volume set by each trader.  In the AMM, the $x \cdot y=k$ equation and depth of the pool determines this <strong>slippage</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>What if</strong> a single buyer had deposited <strong>400</strong> <code>X</code> tokens, instead of two subsequent buyers?  This would have gotten us a price $\mathcal{P} = 3.56\;\; Y/X$, an average between the prices of the first and second buyer.</p>
<h2 id="Depth-&amp;-Slippage">Depth &amp; Slippage<a href="#Depth-&amp;-Slippage">¶</a></h2><p>To find the <strong>slippage</strong>, we compare the price ($\mathcal{P}$) before and after the trade.  Since the price is the derivative, we can say that if we exchange $\delta$ tokens of <code>X</code> the slippage is:</p><p>
$$  \frac{\left. \frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x} - \left. \frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x+\delta}}{\left. \frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x}} $$</p><p>Since  $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-k}{x^2}$ for $y = \frac{k}{x}$, After substitution and rearrangement the slippage $\mathcal{S}$ is:</p><p>
$$ \mathcal{S} = 1 - \left(\frac{x}{x+\delta}\right)^2 $$</p><p>To interpret this formula we can look at two obvious limits:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If we buy a small amount of <code>X</code>, then $\delta &lt;&lt; x$, so $\frac{x}{x+\delta}$ approaches $1$, and slippage tends to <strong>zero</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a <em>deep pool</em>, $x  \rightarrow \infty$, so slippage also approaches 0.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, to avoid price swings, deep liquidity is required.  If we rework the numbers with:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><code>X</code> as <strong>1M</strong> tokens</li>
<li><code>Y</code> has <strong>5M</strong> tokens</li>
<li>$k = 5 \times 10^{12}$</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>and deposit <code>X</code> tokens a few times, you can see that the price will be very stable:</p>

<h2 id="Draining-the-Pool">Draining the Pool<a href="#Draining-the-Pool">¶</a></h2><p>Even with little depth, if the tokens are traded elsewhere with some degree of liquidity, draining the pool is expensive.  Let's consider a pool with:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>100</strong> <code>ETH</code> tokens</p>
<p><strong>35,000</strong> <code>USDC</code> tokens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to buy all <code>USDC</code>s in the pool.  To do so, we will buy <code>USDC</code> by exchanging <strong>100</strong> <code>ETH</code> at a time.  The first transaction gets us <code>17473 USDC</code>, which means the average price of this first transaction is <code>174 USDC/ETH</code>.  The balance in the pool has now moved to <strong>200</strong><code>ETH</code> tokens and <strong>17527</strong><code>USDC</code>, so the price is now <strong>17527/200</strong> ~ <code>87 USDC/ETH</code>.As we drain the pool we can see how the total money spent (assuming the <strong>100</strong> <code>ETH</code> were bought elsewhere at <code>350 USD/ETH</code>) rises up the $x \cdot y = k$ curve.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that it is hard to run out of tokens, as long as the tokens don't lose value in the markets.</p>
<p><strong>FEES DISCLAIMER</strong>: To make our calculations easier, we have ignored what happens to the fees.  The 0.3% is usually returned to the pool.  This means that the invariant is not actually invariant and grows over time (by a 0.3% of the deposited pair with every trade, after the trade)</p>

<p>At a high level, Curve's AMM is a middle ground between Uniswap's product invariant protocol and a linear invariant protocol.  Mathematically, it combines:</p><p>
$$ x \cdot y = k  \; \mathrm{and} \; x + y = C$$</p><p><img src="https://alvarofeito.com/articles/curve/curve_logo.png" alt="curve"></p>
<p>This can be generalized to any number of tokens.  For 3 tokens, we have:</p><p>
$$ x \cdot y \cdot z= k  \; \mathrm{and} \; x + y + z = C$$</p><p>And for $N$ tokens in any proportion,</p><p>
$$ \prod_{i=1}^{N} x_i^{\omega_i} = k  \; \mathrm{and} \; \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i x_i = C$$

<h2 id="Zero-Slippage-AMM?">Zero Slippage AMM?<a href="#Zero-Slippage-AMM?">¶</a></h2><p>Let's imagine an AMM with zero slippage.  This means that the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ of the curve is always the same for all $x$.  In other words, it is a linear function, or $y \propto x$.</p>
<p>Coming back to our previous example of:</p>
<blockquote><p>there are <strong>1000</strong> <code>X</code> tokens and <strong>5000</strong> <code>Y</code> tokens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transactions could obey the equation:
$$5000 x + 1000 y = 10000 $$
or
$$ y = -5x + 10$$</p>
<p>Here, the price would be $\left|\frac{dy}{dx}\right| = 5$, no matter how much <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code> there is in the pool.</p>
<p>Our curve would look like this:</p>

<p>Where the red dot shows was happens as we add <code>X</code> and widthdraw <code>Y</code>.  The invariant is now the total value in the pool.  Since <code>X</code> has a value <strong>5 times larger than</strong> <code>Y</code>, then <strong>10,000</strong> <code>Y</code> tokens has the same value as <strong>2000</strong> <code>X</code> tokens.</p>
<h3 id="No-slippage-is-no-good!">No slippage is no good!<a href="#No-slippage-is-no-good!">¶</a></h3><p>Unfortunately, these linear-invariants (generally $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i x_i = C$) are not good at keeping the pool balanced.  The total value may remain constant, but you can end up running out of tokens.  As we saw, the $x \cdot y=k$ pool self-regulated, making it more and more expensive to bring it out of balance.</p>
<p><strong>CURVE</strong> tries to achieve a compromise between <strong>Low slippage</strong> and <strong>Stable &amp; Balanced</strong> pool.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Curve is a pool for <strong>stablecoins</strong>.  As stablecoins tend to be, well, stable in price, you can take a bit more risk assuming low volatility compared with a random volatile token on Uniswap.  However you don’t want the pool sliding up or down a $x+y=k$ curve leading to a single stablecoin. At some point, Curve needs to make it expensive to continue swapping (Like a $xy=k$ exchange does).</p>
<p>To recap, the token price should remain stable and the pool should remain balanced.  To do so, Curve creates a linear invariant around the <strong>\$1 value</strong>, which becomes a product invariant as the tokens depart away from <strong>\$1</strong>.  As shown in <a href="https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf">the whitepaper</a>, the curve is a combination of $xy=k$ and $x+y=C$</p>
<p><img src="https://alvarofeito.com/articles/curve/curves_curve_comparison.png" alt="curve comparison"></p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>We thus combine the sum invariant of stablecoins: $\sum x_i = D$ with the product invariant $\prod x_i = \left(\frac{D}{n}\right)^n$, where $D$ is the total number of coins <strong>when they have an equal price</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the  <em><a href="https://www.curve.fi/compound">Curve DAI-USDC pool</a></em> could be governed by:</p><p>
$$\mathrm{DAI} + \mathrm{USDC} = 30M$$</p><p>and
$$\mathrm{DAI} \cdot \mathrm{USDC}  = \left(\frac{30M}{2}\right)^2$$</p>
<p>Note that the first equation is a sum without coefficients because both start as stablecoins (with an average value of $1$).
A first idea could be to add up those two equations.  Adding the two equations leads to:</p><p>
$$\left(\mathrm{DAI} + \mathrm{USDC}\right) +
   \left(\mathrm{DAI} \cdot \mathrm{USDC} \right)
= 30M +  \left(\frac{30M}{2}\right)^2$$</p><p>What does this curve look like?  Rearranging $x+y +x\cdot y = 30 + \frac{30^2}{2^2}$, we obtain this plot:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>To make our notation a bit more compact, we will write DAI as $x$ and USDC as $y$. 
Our $x+y + xy = D+\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2$ bonding curve did not prove very effecive.  To make it more effective, we will multiply the "sum invariant" by a factor $\chi$.</p>
<p>If $x+y=D$ becomes $\chi (x+y) = \chi D$, once added to the general equation we obtain: 
$$\chi (x+y) + xy = \chi D+\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2$$</p>
<p>The point of $\chi$ is to give more importance to the <em>low slippage</em> part of the equation.  This is often called an <em>amplified</em> bonding curve.  Let's see how our bonding curve changes as we vary $\chi$ (read <em>Chi</em>) between 1 and 200:</p>

Sean Moriarity and I are glad to announce that the project we have been working on for the last 3 months, Nx, is finally <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx">publicly available on GitHub</a>. Our goal with Nx is to provide the foundation for Numerical Elixir.</p>
<p>
In this blog post, I am going to outline the work we have done so far, some of the design decisions, and what we are planning to explore next. If you are looking for other resources to learn about Nx, you can <a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/034-jose-valim-reveals-project-nx/">hear me unveiling Nx on the ThinkingElixir podcast</a>.</p>

As you see, tensors have a type (s64) and a shape (2x2). Tensor operations are also done with the <code>Nx</code> module. To implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">the Softmax function</a>:</p>

The high-level features in Nx are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
Typed multi-dimensional tensors, where the tensors can be unsigned integers (<code>u8</code>, <code>u16</code>, <code>u32</code>, <code>u64</code>), signed integers (<code>s8</code>, <code>s16</code>, <code>s32</code>, <code>s64</code>), floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) and brain floats (<code>bf16</code>);    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
<a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/NamedTensor">Named tensors</a>, allowing developers to give names to each dimension, leading to more readable and less error prone codebases;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Automatic differentiation, also known as autograd. The <code>grad</code> function provides reverse-mode differentiation, useful for simulations, training probabilistic models, etc;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Tensors backends, which enables the main <code>Nx</code> API to be used to manipulate binary tensors, GPU-backed tensors, sparse matrices, and more;    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Numerical definitions, known as <code>defn</code>, provide multi-stage compilation of tensor operations to multiple targets, such as highly specialized CPU code or the GPU. The compilation can happen either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT) with a compiler of your choice;    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For Python developers, <code>Nx</code> currently takes its main inspirations from <a href="https://numpy.org/"><code>Numpy</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/jax"><code>JAX</code></a> but packaged into a single unified library.</p>
<p>
Our initial efforts have focused on the underlying abstractions. For example, while Nx implements dense tensors out-of-the-box, we also want the same high-level API to be valid for sparse tensors. You should also be able to use all functions in the <code>Nx</code> module with tensors that are backed by Elixir binaries and with tensors that are stored directly in the GPU.</p>
<p>
By ensuring the underlying tensor backend is ultimately replaceable, we can build an ecosystem of libraries on top of Nx, and allow end-users to experiment with different backends, hardware, and approaches to run their software on.</p>
<p>
<em>Nx’s mascot is the Numbat, a marsupial native to southern Australia. Unfortunately the Numbat are endangered and it is estimated to be fewer than 1000 left. If you are excited about Nx, consider donating to Numbat conservation efforts, such as <a href="https://www.numbat.org.au/">Project Numbat</a> and <a href="https://www.australianwildlife.org/">Australian Wildlife Conservancy</a>.</em></p>
<h2>
Numerical definitions</h2>
<p>
One of the most important features in <code>Nx</code> is the numerical definition, called <code>defn</code>. Numerical definitions are a subset of Elixir tailored for numerical computing. Here is the <code>softmax</code> formula above, now written with <code>defn</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>Formula</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4810618200-1">do</span><span>

  </span><span data-group-id="4810618200-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4810618200-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
The first difference we see with <code>defn</code> is that Elixir’s built-in operators have been augmented to also work with tensors. Effectively, <code>defn</code> replaces Elixir’s <code>Kernel</code> with <code>Nx.Defn.Kernel</code>.</p>
<p>
However, <code>defn</code> goes even further. When using <code>defn</code>, <code>Nx</code> builds a computation with all of your tensor operations. Let’s inspect it:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="0860724160-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="0860724160-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0860724160-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="0860724160-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Now when invoked, you will see this printed:</p>

<p>
This computation graph can also be transformed programatically. The transformation is precisely how we implement automatic differentiation, also known as <code>autograd</code>, by traversing each node and computing their derivative:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>grad_softmax</span><span data-group-id="5969204985-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5969204985-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5969204985-2">do</span><span>

</span><span data-group-id="5969204985-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Finally, this computation graph can also be handed out to different compilers. As an example, we have implemented bindings for <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/">Google’s XLA</a> compiler, called EXLA. We can ask the <code>softmax</code> function to use this new compiler with a module attribute:</p>
<pre><code><span>@defn_compiler</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5313365207-1">{</span><span>EXLA</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:host</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-1">}</span><span>

  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-4">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-4">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-5">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-6">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-6">)</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-5">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5313365207-3">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
Once <code>softmax</code> is called, <code>Nx.Defn</code> will invoke <code>EXLA</code> to emit a just-in-time and highly-specialized compiled version of the code, tailored to the tensor type and shape. By passing <code>client: :cuda</code> or <code>client: :rocm</code>, the code can be compiled for the GPU. For reference, here are some benchmarks of the function above when called with a tensor of one million random float values on different clients:</p>

<p>
Where <code>keep</code> indicates the tensor was kept on the device instead of being transferred back to Elixir. You can see the benchmark in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/bench"><code>bench</code></a> directory and find some examples in the <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla/examples"><code>examples</code></a> directory of the EXLA project.</p>
<h3>
Compiling numerical definitions</h3>
<p>
Before moving forward, it is important for us to take a look at how numerical definitions are compiled. For example, take the <code>softmax</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5791259392-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-3">)</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-4">(</span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-5">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-5">)</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-4">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5791259392-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
One might think that Elixir takes the AST of the softmax function above and compiles it directly to the GPU. However, that’s not the case! Numerical definitions are first compiled to Elixir code that will emit the computation graph and this computation graph is then compiled to the GPU. The multiple stages go like this:</p>
<pre><code>Elixir AST
-&gt; compiles to .beam (Erlang VM bytecode)
   -&gt; executes into defn AST
      -&gt; compiles to GPU</code></pre>
<p>
This multi-stage programming is made possible thanks to Elixir macros. For example, when you see a conditional inside <code>defn</code>, that conditional looks exactly like Elixir conditionals, but it will be compiled to an accelerator:</p>
<pre><code><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>softmax</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-1">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>Nx</span><span>.</span><span>any?</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-3">(</span><span>t</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-3">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-4">do</span><span>
    </span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-4">else</span><span>
    </span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="8102420814-4">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8102420814-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In a nutshell, <code>defn</code> provides us with a subset of Elixir for numerical computations that can be compiled to specific hardware, such as CPU, GPU, and other accelerators. All of this was possible without making changes or forking the language.</p>
<p>
And while <code>defn</code> is a subset of the language, it is a considerable one. You will find support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Mathematical operators  </li>
  <li>
Pipes (<code>|&gt;</code>), module attributes, the access syntax (i.e. <code>tensor[1][1..-1]</code>), etc  </li>
  <li>
Elixir macros constructs (imports, aliases, etc)  </li>
  <li>
Control-flow with conditionals (both <code>if</code> and <code>cond</code>), loops (coming soon), etc  </li>
  <li>
Transformations, an explicit mechanism to invoke Elixir code from a <code>defn</code> (which enables constructs such as <code>grad</code>)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And more coming down the road.</p>
<h2>
Why functional programming?</h2>
<p>
At this point, you may be wondering: is functional programming a good fit for numerical computing? One of the main concerns is that immutability can be expensive when working with large blobs of memory. And that’s a valid concern! In fact, when using the default tensor backend, tensors will be backed by Elixir binaries which are copied on every operation. That’s why it was critical for us to design <code>Nx</code> with pluggable backends from day one.</p>
<p>
However, as we move to higher-level abstractions, such as numerical definitions, we will start to reap the benefits of functional programming.</p>
<p>
For example, in order to build computation graphs, immutability becomes an indispensable tool both in terms of implementation and in terms of reasoning. The JAX library for Python, which has been one of the guiding lights for Nx design, also promotes functional and immutable principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>JAX is intended to be used with a functional style of programming</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.ops.html?highlight=functional#indexed-update-operators">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
<em>Unlike NumPy arrays, JAX arrays are always immutable</em>  </p>
  <p>
— <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html?highlight=immutable#JAX-vs.-NumPy">JAX Docs</a>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, frameworks like <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc.ai</a> argue that functional programming can provide better abstractions and more composable building blocks for deep learning libraries.</p>
<p>
We hope that, by exploring these ideas in a language that is functional by design, Elixir can bring new ideas and insights at the higher-level.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my cofounder</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineboulanger/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I</a> have engaged in hundreds of conversations with engineering leaders on our journey to improve engineering. We talked with Silicon Valley startups just getting started as well as established enterprises with thousand-person headcounts.</p>
<p>What we discovered surprised us: <strong>Not only can software engineering effectiveness be measured; most engineering teams follow the exact same evolution.</strong></p>
<p>From a two-person startup to a thousand-person team, engineering success always comes from the same fundamentals: 1) Hire excellent engineers and 2) <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Remove the blockers that prevent their success</a>.</p>
<p>Different team sizes, however, change the ways these fundamentals manifest. Broadly, they fit into five stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative</li>
<li>Data-Curious</li>
<li>People-Driven Engineering Effectiveness</li>
<li>Software-Driven Effectiveness</li>
<li>Engineering Effectiveness as a Strategic Advantage</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.okayhq.com/assets/img/5_stages_o.a91f2d0.png" alt="The 5 stages of Engineering Effectiveness"></p><p>While you're perusing these stages, keep in mind that every engineering org starts somewhere and every org can reach stage 5. Regardless of the size or age of your team, your engineering effectiveness would benefit from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objectively assessing your current engineering org: What stage are you in and why?Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solidifying a strong foundation: Ensure you've built all the components of your current and lower stages.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Aiming higher: Add advanced functions to accelerate your achievement.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, individual organizations have their own unique traits, so you should feel free to make this framework your own. On the whole, however, here's how to grow:Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-qualitative">Stage 1: Qualitative</h2>
<p>Most engineering teams start small. At this point (usually around 1-20 people), the team is evolving rapidly and there aren't many objective metrics to measure success.</p>
<p><strong>In stage 1, the most successful engineering organizations build a strong social, cultural, and behavioral foundation.</strong> This foundation should include implementing widely-known best practices like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sprint retrospectives</a> to identify patterns of effectiveness</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Test-driven development</a> and version control with small, frequent commits</li>
<li>Flexible hours with high employee autonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>With stage 1 being almost metric-free, engineering success relies almost entirely on your first-line managers.  We've found these managers to be the differentiators between successful stage 1 orgs and those that flounder. If your org is in stage 1, be on the lookout for strong managers: ones who are either experienced and well-trained or inexperienced but exceptionally fast learners.</p>
<p>To support a stage 1 engineering org, company leadership should create a high-trust environment in team meetings/all hands (to encourage feedback) and keep a pulse on morale through high-quality one-on-ones. It's also helpful for long-term culture to invest in manager growth and development, particularly around people skills and EQ. (We've found <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-develop-and-support-managers/steps/introduction/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google's framework</a> to be particularly effective at helping managers become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">servant leaders</a>.)</p>
<p>In stage 1, engineering revolves around culture: you'll succeed if your managers can support and align your team.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-data-curious-and-reactive">Stage 2: Data-Curious and Reactive</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 2 is when most orgs first become aware of engineering effectiveness as an area to improve, so they start dabbling in data.</strong></p>
<p>As most stage 2 orgs are small and fast-growing (20-50 people), they must still rely heavily on first-line managers for qualitative measures like:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OKR</a> completion</li>
<li>Team engagement</li>
<li>Hiring targets</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 2 will also bring your first quantitative measures, typically in the form of ad hoc metrics like:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug counts</li>
<li>Alert rates</li>
<li>Employee satisfaction surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>On the dev ops side, successful stage 2 orgs typically begin investing in a pipeline aimed at achieving continuous delivery. These investments often include custom scripts or open-source tools that provide snapshots of their DORA metrics.</p>
<p>These instantaneous measurements and metrics help make stage 2 engineering orgs more effective than those in stage 1. That said, these stage 2 improvements are typically ad hoc, one-off, and isolated. Instead of a comprehensive, real-time dashboard or even a long-term feedback loop, stage 2 orgs act on instantaneous information as it arises, necessarily making the org's improvements reactive.</p>
<h2 id="stage-3-people-driven-engineering-effectiveness">Stage 3: People-Driven Engineering Effectiveness Â&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The typical stage 3 engineering org will have 50-250 engineers and feel like it's in a transition stage between independent qualitative assessments and fully-automated metrics.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In stage 3, the best engineering teams establish a dedicated function for engineering effectiveness</strong>, most frequently through a dedicated internal team or by hiring an engineering chief of staff. This dedicated function will begin to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>A regular cadence of investments in dev tech, processes, and tooling</li>
<li>Looker dashboards to capture DORA metrics in real time</li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SLAs/SLOs</a> for engineering effectiveness</li>
<li>Tangible, objectively-verifiable effectiveness metrics that will hold managers accountableÂ&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>While stage 3 brings both long-term metrics and systems that provide a holistic view, most of these activities will be performed by hand.</strong> For example, the engineering Chief of Staff or program manager might ask directors to fill out a spreadsheet, which will then evolve into a powerpoint presentation that prompts the VP to make adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>A successful stage 3 engineering org will implement a dedicated engineering effectiveness team to measure metrics and incorporate adjustments at a reliable cadence.</strong></p>
<h2 id="stage-4-software-driven-effectiveness">Stage 4: Software-Driven Effectiveness</h2>
<p><strong>In stage 4, dedicated software enters the picture, bringing continuous improvement to every engineering stage.</strong></p>
<p>The typical stage 4 engineering org will have hundreds or thousands of engineers. At this scale, treating engineering like a black box is no longer acceptable. Instead, managers will require precise, quantitative assessments instead of qualitative or imprecise measures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most successful stage 4 teams automate a high variety of engineering metrics, either through dashboards built by a full-time engineering effectiveness team or by leveraging <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third-party software</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These dashboards gather actionable, real-time effectiveness metrics at every level of management:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CTO sets high-level metrics and goals, typically through a dashboard they share with the other executives.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Directors/mid-level managers set goals for their sub-orgs and monitor their metrics for early signs of issues.</li>
<li>First-line managers provide root-cause analysis on the specific factors contributing to high-level metrics.</li>
<li>Every engineering OKR includes goals around effectiveness and improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before stage 4, engineering teams often aim to measure everything. In stage 4, they aim more precisely at high-value metrics like engineer utilization, <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/blog/engineering-productivity-can-be-measured" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blockers</a>, and work-life balance. Stage 4 brings the ability for an org to diagnose specific symptoms all the way down to their root causes, where they can form coherent, data-backed stories that inform pinpointed improvements. The most successful stage 4 teams will even start uncovering personalized metrics that they find particularly correlate to their success.</p>
<p><strong>By combining automated, real-time metrics with the culture of continuous improvement built in stages 1-3, stage 4 teams can evolve their effectiveness into an always-running, well-oiled improvement machine.</strong></p>
<h2 id="stage-5-engineering-effectiveness-as-a-strategic-advantage">Stage 5: Engineering Effectiveness as a Strategic Advantage</h2>
<p><strong>Stage 5 turns engineering effectiveness into a strategic lever that helps the company achieve precise business goals.</strong></p>
<p>Even though a typical stage 5 team will contain hundreds or thousands of engineers all around the world, the best stage 5 orgs run like a well-coordinated symphony: individual contributions come together to create a single unit that's much more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>On top of stage 4's software-based measurement and org-wide culture of improvement, stage 5 adds a strategic lens. The best stage 5 organizations can make calculated risks involving conscious trade-offs. Perhaps the org extrapolates a concerning quality trend and adjusts its features long before engineers or customers start to complain. The best stage 5 organizations can calculate specific risk levels and readjust without unpleasant surprises.</p>
<p>High-performing stage 5 teams typically engage in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry/peer-group <a href="https://dealstruck.com/resources/the-power-of-peer-benchmarking/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">benchmarking</a> (to understand their effectiveness compared to other companies)</li>
<li>Automatic implementation of the latest effectiveness research (to accelerate constant improvement)</li>
<li>Anticipatory activities at every stage in the org (to predict potential problems before they arise)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thought leadership on new best practices of engineering effectiveness (naturally uncovered as a result of their experience)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Full transparency/understanding of engineering metrics, even outside of the engineering org (to aid company-wide improvement)</li>
<li>Calculated risks (to achieve precise business aims)</li>
</ul>
<p>From the outside, a stage 5 team looks like a strong engineering brand. It can accelerate and adjust, attract top talent while achieving business aims.</p>
<h2 id="toward-engineering-effectiveness">Toward Engineering EffectivenessÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Engineering effectiveness is too expensive to be left to chance. Start by assessing where your team currently is. Are you:Â&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficiently small that metrics are still a "nice to have"?</li>
<li>Data-curious and ready to react?</li>
<li>In need of a dedicated effectiveness team?</li>
<li>Positioned to produce a continuously improving organizationÂ&nbsp;?</li>
<li>Able to precisely tune your priorities to enable the company's long-term strategy?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, solidify your position at your current stage, building a solid foundation on which you can expand.</strong></p>
<p>While every engineering team has its own individual nuance, most will follow this consistent evolution. We uncovered these stages through years of observation, but there's still more improvement to be applied to engineering.</p>
<p>We've made it our mission to improve engineering effectiveness. If you've uncovered your own trends or if you're curious for more, <a href="https://okayhq.typeform.com/to/O47Fx3Q7" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">let us know</a>. We'd love to improve engineering effectiveness for everyone.</p></div></div></div>]]>

The talk was moderated by Russell Kaplan (Scale AI) and the panel included Richard Socher (You, Salesforce Research), Justin Johnson (University of Michigan, Facebook), Andrej Karpathy (Tesla).

By using natural language labels (as seen in CLIP), we get representations <em>anchored</em> in a wide variety of real world concepts (as coverd by text in the training pairs).

Companies planning to use ML in a production setting will get the most compounding return on investment by focusing on software/infrastructure/engineering (from data curation to model serving). It is also telling that companies focused on ML toolkits (make it easier to collect/curate data, train and deploy models) are attracting VC funding. Examples include Weights and Biases, HuggingFace, ScaleAI etc.</p><h2 id="parrallelization-hardware-and-low-level-optimization-are-important"><a href="#parrallelization-hardware-and-low-level-optimization-are-important" aria-label="parrallelization hardware and low level optimization are important permalink"></a>Parrallelization, Hardware and Low Level Optimization are Important!</h2><p>Low level optimization (e.g. C/C++ implementations of model routines) is another area that is often overlooked, but remains very important. Models like Transformers that lend themselves well to being parralelized (especially on today's hardware platforms) are well positioned to have more impact. In practice, some algorithms may not be the best, but appear more interesting/popular because they have <span>won the hardware lottery</span>.</p><p>Similarly, looking towards the future, a panelist (Richard) mentioned he expects to see explorations in new objective functions, new domains (e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI economist</a>, <a href="https://blog.einstein.ai/progen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protein Folding problems</a> etc) mostly implemented with parallization in mind (async SGD).</p><h3 id="addressing-catastrophic-forgetting-towards-continuous-learning"><a href="#addressing-catastrophic-forgetting-towards-continuous-learning" aria-label="addressing catastrophic forgetting towards continuous learning permalink"></a>Addressing Catastrophic Forgetting, Towards Continuous Learning.</h3><p>One of the draw backs of the current approach to AI research is that each task is explored independently in silos. For example models trained to predict sentiment are not reused for translation. On one hand, this is explained by catastrophic forgetting - a known issue with neural networks - but also inhibits progress towards general purpose models.</p><p>Perhaps, one way to improve on this is to create a paradigm that <em>enforces</em> continous learning on a common neural substrate. How can we create a single neural substrate model that can be continuously (perhaps sequentially) trained, gets better at <strong>multiple tasks</strong> without forgetting? How do we figure out which weights to update to encode new knowledge, which weights to avoid, which waits to update to ensure we can retain previous knowledge?</p><p>This is also reminiscent of other short comings of today's neural networks - most NLP models today struggle with long text - they break down beyond ~100 tokens. We dont have models than can read long text (e.g chapters in a book) and generate meaningful summaries without loosing context. To address this, we perhaps need to innovate beyond Transformers (current SOTA) which scale quadratically wrt to sequence length.</p><p>Also, models today struggle with reasoning/logic capabilities. E.g. GPT can perform simple multiplications but struggles as the numbers get larger. Which brings us to the next point - how do we create models that can reason?</p><h3 id="models-capable-of-logicreasoning"><a href="#models-capable-of-logicreasoning" aria-label="models capable of logicreasoning permalink"></a>Models Capable of Logic/Reasoning</h3><p>There are multiple approaches to this …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I moved back to Southern California in late 2020 after 13 years in San Francisco working on startups. Through work, life, and Tahoe ski leases, I talked to a lot of founders about marketing. The vast majority of our conversations would veer into what they could do better, even with the most successful ones. (Startup founders, always ambitious 😂)</p><p>Each conversation started differently, but they often led to the same answer from me: "Do more marketing research". While the founders knew a lot about their customers when it came to product, they didn't when it came to marketing. </p></div><h2><strong>The problem</strong></h2><div><p>Modern marketing is complex, and it's a lot harder when you're not working with an audience you know well. Some audiences are more competitive than others, but no matter whom you're marketing to, there's a lot of noise to break through. To actually get your message heard, you have to produce marketing that is both high quality and unique (and of course, relevant). </p><p>Weak customer insights make this hard and can hold back any of your customer facing marketing projects, whatever your business model or industry.</p><p>Despite this, it's common for founders to do deep research for their product, but do little for marketing. <br>‍<br>What weak insights can look like:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>You don't know your potential customers' goals or concerns about your product well enough to write website copy that builds trust</li><li>You don't know the communities where your customers really learn things from and instead post to crowded communities where it gets little attention</li></ul><h2><strong>Strong customer insights</strong></h2><div><p>Strong customer insights allow you to address potential customer’s concerns and build trust with your marketing. You get stronger insights by doing more customer research, asking better questions, and finding ways to gather information without talking to customers.</p><p>Great insights look like knowing:<strong></strong></p></div><ul role="list"><li>The right combination of jargon and language to make potential customers trust your product to solve their problems</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>The organizations and people who influence your customer’s buying decisions</li><li>The specific concerns that stop your audience from buying and your audience's goals that drive them to buy</li></ul><p>While marketing research can be hard work, you're building a foundation for more effective marketing in the future. The better you get at collecting insights, the easier it gets to produce results with your marketing. <strong></strong><br></p><div><p>Building rich customer insights helps validate your marketing before you even start working on it. Like product development, each new piece of customer information helps you further refine your planning to what your customers actually want to see and hear from you.</p><p>You don’t need to be an expert at research for this. I’ll walk you through the details and my process.</p></div><h2><strong>What to collect</strong></h2><div><p>The data points that will be useful to you depend on whether you’re B2C or B2B, self-serve or sales person driven, what marketing channels you're using, what stage you’re at, and more. </p><p>In general, the types of data to collect are:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Customer demographic data</li><li>Where customers spend time online and offline</li><li>How and where customers get new information</li><li>Customer buying processes</li><li>Customer job-specific demographic data (Much more B2B than B2C)</li><li>Customer company data (B2B only)</li></ul><p>For example, if you’re selling to consumers, you might want to know the following:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Favorite large-scale events</li><li>Social networks they use most</li><li>What kind of phones they have</li><li>Income range</li><li>What messaging apps they use to talk to friends</li></ul><p>And if you’re selling to businesses, you might want to know these data points:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Common job titles</li><li>Concerns with buying a product like yours</li><li>Favorite content specs</li><li>Organizations that influence their purchases</li><li>Company office location</li></ul><p>You likely have some data so you’re not starting from scratch. <br></p><h2><strong>Applying that data</strong></h2><p>Any of your customer facing marketing projects can be affected by not having deep enough insights.&nbsp;Sometimes it’s obvious what you can use the data for, but people generally underestimate the number of uses for many data points.<br>‍<br>Some of the different ways you can use this data:<br></p><p>Knowing what jargon and language your customers use is important for building credibility through your:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Website copy</li><li>Ads</li><li>Content</li></ul><p>Knowing your audience’s goals can lead to better:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Blog subjects</li><li>Social posts</li><li>Sales pitches</li></ul><p>Knowing the organizations and people that influence your audience can:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Give you partnership ideas</li><li>Give you content ideas</li><li>Help you find your way into their buying process</li></ul><h2><strong>Collecting data</strong></h2><div><p>When people hear the words "marketing research" they typically think of customer interviews, focus groups, and surveys. These methods involve collecting data directly from your audience.</p><p>Indirect methods such as getting data from public sources, commercial sources, internal sources, and using inference are often ignored even though they can provide a wealth of data.<br>‍<br>You build the deepest customer insights by combining your direct and indirect research. </p><p>Confidence in your data depends on both the source of the data and how many times you've heard a similar thing. </p><p>To make this work well, you need dedicated time for data collection. Don't just bolt a set of marketing questions onto the end of a product interview and expect good insights. </p></div><ul role="list"><li><p>Direct - Data directly from your audience, both customers and non-customers</p><ul role="list"><li>Interviews with current or potential customers</li><li>Focus groups</li><li>Surveys to existing customers</li></ul></li><li><p>Public - Data your audience released publicly</p><ul role="list"><li>Look at what your audience is saying in communities</li><li>See what is reported in the press</li><li>Marketing campaigns and materials</li></ul></li><li><p>Commercial - Data from businesses that sell it, though sometimes they release data for free to market their paid products</p><ul role="list"><li>Data brokers</li><li>Third-party surveys and reports</li></ul></li><li><p>Internal - Sources from within your business</p><ul role="list"><li>Ask customer-facing roles	</li><li>Customer app profile</li><li>Marketing collection from content download forms and data from offline and online events</li></ul></li><li><p>Inference - Educated guesses for data points based off other data</p><ul role="list"><li>Analyzing data</li><li>Using IP for location data</li><li>Determine business model by pricing model</li><li>Content subjects from job responsibilities</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>How to start</strong></h2><div><p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>First you need a place to keep this information as you collect it that keeps the data organized and easy to access. This step also helps make the process feel more important, which leads to it getting prioritized higher. </p><p>Here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bjYbE8L3HDFr2KEkgd9Su1e28s6xNKeB7rMRDS-w4Dw/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets template</a> to get you started.<br>‍<br><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Create a list of all the data points you want to cover in your customer research. As I mentioned previously, the areas to think about are:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Data point</li><li>Data</li><li>Last updated</li><li>Source of data</li><li>Confidence (scale of 1-3)</li></ul><p>‍<br><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Create a list of all the data points you want to cover in your customer research. As I mentioned previously, the areas to think about are:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Customer demographics</li><li>Where you customers spend time online and offline</li><li>How and where your customers get new information</li><li>Customer buying processes</li><li>Customer job-specific demographic data (Much more B2B than B2C)</li><li>Customer company data (B2B only)</li></ul><div><p><strong>Step 3</strong><br>You likely already have some of these data points collected. Fill in the sheet with what you already know and include the source and date of the info if you have it.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<strong>Step 4<br>‍</strong>Identify your most important data points and see what still needs to be added to prioritize for the next step. Your goal is a complete picture of who your audience is, but that takes time, so you start by focusing on the data points with the highest value that you’re missing and go from there.</p><p><strong>Step 5&nbsp;<br></strong>Now that you know what you need, it’s time to do a round of customer research. What type can depend on what data you’re looking for or trying to verify.</p><p>Some general options:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Interview customers</li><li>Interview non-customers in your market</li><li>Observe communities</li><li>Find a data broker that sells what you need</li><li>Look internally for clues from your sales and customer service processes</li></ul><p><strong>Step 6&nbsp;<br></strong>Set aside dedicated time on a regular schedule to collect more information and verify what you currently have. I recommend every quarter or more frequently if you have the resources.<br>‍<br>Audiences aren’t static. Your current audiences can be further refined or might change their tastes or how they get new information. You bring in new audiences as the product changes and business grows and sometimes completely drops old ones.<br></p><p>I hope this was helpful!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body"><p><img id="imgSection" src="https://jscharting.com/blog/best-javascript-front-end-frameworks-2021/images/cover.jpg"> <time id="pubDate">01/22/2021</time></p><p>For more than 8 years, JavaScript has been the most popular programming language. JavaScript popularity has only grown over time and this meteoric rise has resulted in widespread usage from standard front-end development, to server-side usage through node.js to mobile application development. A plethora of front-end JavaScript frameworks and JS libraries have been created by developers, for developers to save time and improve application quality. The 6 most popular options are:</p><p>React.js is the leading JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Often erroneously referred to as a front-end JavaScript framework, the React library handles only the View layer of the complete Model View Controller (MVC) for building user interfaces and facilitates the creation of reusable user interface components. React is an open-source library that uses a virtual DOM that optimizes DOM updates to only those components that are changed while giving front end developers the freedom to code as if the page is rendered for each change. React uses JSX which appears similar to HTML, and is a syntax extension to JavaScript. JSX gives developers a helpful visual aid for user interface development inside of JavaScript code. JSX also provides native XSS protection by sanitizing inputs by default. It's also possible to use React without JSX working with native JavaScript. Babel supports syntax highlighting for JSX in your favorite Javascript Editors. React's use of JSX results in a steeper learning curve as you must learn this on top of familiarizing yourself with the library. Unlike other JS frameworks, you need to build your own workflow rather than using integrated framework tools. React helps create complex user interfaces using components that split the UI into reusable sections. Components accept inputs (termed props which are similar to JavaScript functions) and return React elements describing what should be rendered on screen. React does not require a dependency injection library or framework since it is based on reusable user interface components. React Native provides mobile app development for iOS and Android offering the best parts of native development with React for mobile app user interfaces. For enhanced performance, React allows for server-side rendering to static markup with ReactDOMserver typically used with node.js. React apps enable you to set up a modern react web app with a single command and one dependency.</p><p>A Note on Web Components and React:</p><p>React and Web Components solve different problems and developers typically don't use Web Components with React although they are supported (for example if you have a UI component that was written using Web Components). As the React site clarifies, "Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary."</p><p>React is by far the most used with Github "used by" statistics exceeding 3 million. You should choose React if you prefer to have a virtual DOM and need a lot of ready-to-use components.</p><p>Vue.js bills itself as the progressive JavaScript framework, which allows for adoption incrementally within your application architecture from single-page applications to full-stack integrations. Vue was created by Evan You after working at Google. Evan wanted to build a JavaScript framework that would extract the best parts of AngularJS while being much more lightweight. While lightweight, Vue offers an "incrementally adoptable ecosystem" which scales between a JavaScript library and a full-featured popular JavaScript framework for complex web applications. Vue enables you to create reusable components encapsulating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for common user interface elements. Vue has a gentler learning curve compared with Angular and React as you are not required to learn typescript (Microsoft's superset of JavaScript required for Angular) or JSX (Typically used with React) and can leverage existing vanilla JavaScript knowledge. Vue shows Github "used by" of 1.2 million.</p><p>You should choose Vue if you want a framework with excellent documentation that is easy to start with.</p><p>AngularJS or Angular 1 was created by Google as a front-end framework for MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) implementations in 2009 for its web development projects. Subsequently, Google's Angular team lead the creation of Angular aka Angular 2 which is based on TypeScript and is a complete re-write undertaken by the original team that created AngularJS. Angular utilizes HTML as a template language and supports extending HTML's syntax. Unlike React, Angular is a full frontend framework. Angular has a steep learning curve and has faced criticism for two-way data binding that some consider an anti-pattern that is difficult to maintain and debug in complex applications or understand through code review.</p><p>You should choose angular if you want a powerful framework backed by google and are already invested in typescript.</p><p>An honorable mention to Svelte which is a JavaScript framework that compiles to JavaScript at build time resulting in better client-side performance. Svelte has no virtual DOM or client-side dependencies and is the most recent framework to gain popularity according to the StateOfJS surveys. Billed as "a radical new approach to building user interfaces," Svelte shifts the bulk of the work that occurs in the browser for other frameworks and libraries, to compilation that happens when you build your application. Originally released in 2016 and recently passing a version 3 milestone, Svelte is growing in popularity for developers that value performance. This performance does come at the cost of compatibility where browsers such as IE11 and older are not supported with generated code and the overall ecosystem is not as developed as frameworks that have a larger and more established user base. Github Used by 11k.</p><p>You should choose Svelte if you are looking for a lightweight framework that is high performance and reasonable learning curve.</p><p>Preact is billed as a smaller, faster React alternative using the same API. Preact focuses on optimizing performance, size (~3kb vs ~45kb for React), efficient memory usage, and offers a low learning curve for React users and overall compatibility with the React API. While the project is lean and optimized for its goals, preact-compat offers drop-in compatibility for existing React code without any changes. This can be useful for projects that rely heavily on React features not in Preact; however, you give up some of the benefits of Preact using this compatibility layer. Github used by 19k.</p><p>You should choose Preact if you want a fast and lean drop-in replacement for React.</p><p>Ember.js, the self-described "framework for ambitious web developers" is focused on developer productivity. Ideally suited for single-page applications based on the MVVM pattern, Ember.js was created by Yehuda Katz who was previously a core team member at jQuery. Useful for client-side applications, Ember also includes an official data layer which makes back-end integration easy with two-way data binding using Ember data. Ember has its own plugin repository that offers a variety of helpful integrations. Ember's Ember-CLI, a command-line add-on provides support for various technologies including CoffeeScript, Handlebars, SaaS/Less and more. Github Used by 20k.</p><p>You should choose ember if you want an elegant and quick-to-develop framework with a great community.</p><h2>Up and coming:</h2><p>LitElement evolved out of Polymer 3.0 and has a performance advantage over React as the number of rendered elements increases. A simple, lightweight framework, LitElement allows you to use other frameworks since it's a standard ES6 component itself and has an extensive library of web components available via NPM. There is a lot to like with LitElement.</p><p>Caleb Porzio created Alpine as leaner approach to reactive and declarative frameworks with the goal of reducing overhead while maintaining DOM. There is no build step and the library is under 5KB compressed. While it may not replace larger frameworks, it can also be used in combination with them similar to LitElement.</p><p>A self-described framework with modest ambitions, Stimulus doesn't render HTML or aspire to manage your complete frontend, but rather augment HTML. Stimulus was created by the Basecamp team who ate their own dogfood with the recently launched HEY email service. You should take a closer look at stimulus if you have projects that are primarily HTML and use JavaScript sparingly to improve the user experience.</p><p>From single web pages to advanced business logic and data flows for complex applications, there is a framework, library and developer community that is here to help. We hope this look at the best JavaScript frameworks and libraries helps you explore new options or affirm your current choices and ultimately push your software development forward. While developer's needs are as diverse as the options available, if you aren't already working with React, we suggest you do so. Not only is it the most used library by far, it's also the most likely to be reused by those that have used it previously.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Bitcoin is a complicated software artifact which requires active investment in discovering its flaws
to harden and strengthen its implementations against fatal attacks and insidious bugs. Over the last
year I’ve been investing significant efforts to put Bitcoin’s Mempool under the microscope to
categorise potential bugs and vulnerabilities and come up with plans and patches to fix them.</p>
<p>The fruits of this labor so far have been promising in their ability to address substantial
stability issues in Bitcoin, but there is still much work to be done to fully implement the
necessary changes and tackle some of the harder architectural challenges. The Mempool serves as the
main gatekeeper for submitting transactions to the network for inclusion in a block, which makes it
one of the main ways all types of users interact with Bitcoin, and drives the urgency of completing
this security critical work in a manner that respects the myriad of currently supported uses.</p>
<p>Judica exists in part to build a team to tackle the hard problems facing Bitcoin. In the last two
months, <a href="https://judica.org/blog/100x-grant/">100x/BitMEX</a> and <a href="https://judica.org/blog/acinq-grant">ACINQ</a> have issued grants to
support Judica’s work improving Bitcoin’s Mempool over the next year. To grow our team, I plan to
use these grants to sponsor other developers (either in a full or part time capacity) to contribute
to the Mempool efforts.  One of the chief bottlenecks in Bitcoin development is tight review and
feedback loops on ambitious projects like this, so having more developers engaged under contract to
complete this project as a team will help us deliver results for the Bitcoin community.</p>
<p>Judica is not the only organization working on improving the Mempool, Bitcoin developers have paid
serious attention to it over the years and have made vast improvements and contributions. Other
contributors are focused on issues like package relay and rebroadcasting. However, with this new
effort I’m hoping to assemble the resources to make sustained progress on the  goals described below and
increase the number of developers who understand the Mempool functionality fully enough to provide
high-quality review.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this blog post, I’m going to explain the tensions between implementing an
idealized functionality of the Mempool and making it secure against resource exhaustion attacks.</p>
<h2 id="the-mempool-bitcoins-mvp">The Mempool: Bitcoin’s MVP</h2>
<p>The Mempool is one of the most critical subsystems in the Bitcoin network, yet its function is
poorly understood by many businesses and projects. What role does the Mempool play?</p>
<p>Before transactions are mined in a block, they are typically submitted to the network to be relayed
and stored until block inclusion. A Bitcoin miner uses the Mempool to select which transactions they
wish to include into a block. A perfectly rational node would accept and store all transactions it
had ever seen and pick the best transactions (i.e., those paying the highest fees) for mining.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is why the Mempool is such an important data structure in Bitcoin. With a less
rational Mempool, miners would produce less valuable blocks, and there would be less incentive to
mine. All of Bitcoin would suffer for having worse security.</p>
<p>It’s not practical to store, process, and consider all transactions, so instead nodes make decisions
on what to accept based on a number of heuristics. The Mempool is used for more than just mining,
network nodes use the Mempool to figure out what is likely to be included in a block in the future
to decrease block propagation latency and to relay other profitable transactions across the network,
improving privacy (not all transactions from a node are yours) and improving the user experience of
transaction broadcast.</p>
<p>The Mempool has a number of artificial constraints on what types of transactions it will accept by
default. These limitations include static checks (e.g., the size of the transaction in bytes or
“weight units”) and contextual checks (e.g., is this transaction mineable immediately, does it pay
more fee than other transactions, or does it have more unconfirmed parent or grandparent
transactions than permitted or cause another transaction to have more children transactions than
permitted).</p>
<p>These rules are artificial in the sense that they are locally decided policies that are not
generally enforced. In other words, when you mine a block, these Mempool restrictions are not
considered. Why does the Mempool need to have stricter rules than a block?</p>
<h3 id="its-complicated">It’s Complicated!</h3>
<p>Many of the Mempool algorithms are “superlinearly algorithmically complex”. This means that as the
Mempool grows, if these restrictions were not enforced, the amount of work to select transactions
for a block to mine could grow as well, which can lead to resource exhaustion, denial-of-service,
and cost miners money with a loss of uptime. Imagine it taking more time for a miner to decide what
should go into a block than it takes to mine the block itself! Therefore we need stricter rules in
the mempool to prevent these blowouts.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, a number of algorithms in the Mempool are suboptimal, meaning where a small amount
of operations might be sufficient, a much larger amount is done. Suboptimal often also means that
while the overall work is similar in terms of the number of operations, the algorithm’s operations
are inefficient to run (maybe allocating too much memory or just doing something slowly).
</p><figure>
    <img src="https://judica.org/img/complex-mempool.png" alt="Visualization of Mempool with 10,000 transactions. See this PR for more details. This makes it easy to see how the work becomes harder as more entries are added." width="100%"> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These algorithms performance mean that we have to determine safe limitations for what we will accept
into the Mempool that fits within our computational budgets, and if the performance is suboptimal,
we end up with stricter limitations than necessary, or even end up requiring a limitation where it
would be fine not to have any. Developers often determine safe limits experimentally (as opposed to
by a rigorous proof), which means we have to include an additional safety margin in case we haven’t
found the true worst case behavior.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-worst-that-can-happen">What’s the worst that can happen?</h3>
<p>Because we make a best effort, and not a perfect one, Mempool implementations have to make some
tough decisions about which transactions to process and which to ignore in order to prevent resource
exhaustion or other denial-of-service vulnerabilities. Even with the guards we have in place, it’s
possible that a series of carefully crafted but otherwise normal input could cause all nodes on the
network to crash or cease to be functional.</p>
<p>Fully understanding the gap between perfectly rational Mempool behavior and computationally limited
Mempool behavior can be quite hard and full of surprising edge cases, which is the bane of many
protocol developers and infrastructure operators.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s a generic issue called “mempool pinning” which impacts protocols like the
Lightning Network or when exchanges payout via batches. The issue comes up when a transaction in the
Mempool has two outputs owned by two different parties, one good, one evil. The evil party attaches
a bunch of low-fee transactions to their output. Now, because of the Mempool’s limitations on how
many child spends an unconfirmed transaction may have, the good party is unable to spend from their
unconfirmed output. This seems like a minor problem, but the issue can be more severe in contexts
that rely on Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) for paying for fees and have time lock conditions.</p>
<h3 id="so-whatre-we-gonna-do-about-that">So what’re we gonna do about that?!</h3>
<p>Don’t fret. Judica is working to improve the Mempool. The Mempool Project is an effort that has multiple
components aimed at improving Mempool performance with the goal of reducing the maximum memory the
Mempool requires to operate and improving performance. This work may ultimately lead to being able
to remove some restrictions previously required or loosen them up. This makes application developers
happy, improves mining revenue, and hopefully helps protocols be more robust against attacks.</p>
<p>To complete this work, multiple components must be developed simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Epoch Mempool –  a base level algorithmic improvement across the Mempool with minimal
architectural changes that has already shown major performance benefits (2-3x faster on difficult
benchmarks) but requires more review and testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mempool Stress Tests – identifying and assembling a catalogue of worst-case exploitable
behaviors (with and without current limitations enforced and other non standard node flags). This
makes us more confident in the changes we’re making and can also discover and prevent regressions
introducing new Denial-of-Service issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major architectural re-design – reconsideration of the general design of the Mempool to improve
how transactions are selected for mining, relay, and eviction to fully address issues like pinning
and improve rationality.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
	
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">OpenCelliD</a> is the world's largest 
	open database of cell towers with a license
	<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>
</p>

<p>
	Data has full world coverage and freely available for
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">download.</a>
</p>

<p>
	This tabular data[1] has ~40 million rows and 6 columns in it but only 3
	columns (latitude, longitude, and type) are used in this visualization.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png" alt="">
</a>

<em>[1] Structure of input data.</em></p><p>
	Above table data is read line by line and grouped by their location info.
	Grouping is done as if they were <a href="https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/xyz-tiles-and-slippy-maps/">XYZ Tiles.</a></p>


<p>
	First, empty 2d integer arrays for each tile are created and its elements are 
	initialized with value = 0. 
	Those values hold a counter that shows the number of rows that 
	geographically contained in that pixel.
	Every row increases the relevant counter by one[2]. 
	After iterating all rows with this method, we end up with a bunch of
	integer values (in different 2d arrays) that represent row counts per region.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[2] Each row increases relevant counter.</em></p><p>
	In order to achieve city-level resolution for visualization, tiles up to
	zoom level 9 should be generated. 
	<a href="https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/">
	For XYZ tiles, the number of tiles per zoom level is 4^zoom.</a>
	Therefore, for zoom levels between 0 to 9, the number of tiles that should be generated 
	becomes 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + .. + 4^9 which equals to 349525.
	Every tile has 256x256 integer values.
	Even with using 32 bit-sized integer values, 
	one tile occupies 256 * 256 * 32 bit = 256 kilobytes of storage,
	and <b>349525 tiles</b> occupies <b>87 gigabytes of storage</b> which is 
	definitely not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	To solve this size problem every tile blob is compressed independently
	with a modern compression algorithm 
	<a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">brotli</a>.
	Despite being slow to encode, brotli has a fast decoding speed and high compression ratio
	compared to older compression methods like gzip. Additionally, 
	brotli-compressed-data is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=brotli">
	natively decodable with all modern browsers</a>.
	Since there are no cell towers in oceans or uninhabitable areas, tiles for those regions 
	are full of zero values or very sparse. Due to this high redundancy,
	compression performed extremely well for those regions (256kb compressed to 20~100bytes).
</p>

<p>
    In order to simplify the algorithm, it is described as if there was only one 
    counter value in each pixel, but there are 4 counter values per pixel each
    holding number of row counts for different cell tower types[3]
</p>


<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[3] Every pixel stores more than one channels (counter)</em></p><p>
    Even though these tiles are stored like XYZ tiles, they are not 
    valid XYZ tiles.Since these blobs are just brotli-compressed-integer-arrays.
    Visualization requires a blob to image conversion. This conversion is
    done by client side javascript and HTML5 Canvas API.
</p>

<p>
    Underlying map displaying library in this visualization is
    <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet</a>.
    Kudos to leaflet author(s) for writing such a well documented and extendable
    map library, I was able to write a custom tile layer for leaflet that 
    intercepts the image tile requests made by leaflet and redirects those
    image tile requests to an image generating (client-side) web worker that 
    works like a tile server. Web worker follows a simple algorithm for image generation.

    It reads the row count values pixel by pixel and generates a color for that
    pixel (higher the row count lighter and more opaque the pixel color).
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, this was a fun project for me to work on and I learned a lot 
    about data compression and multi-threading while working on this. 
    By off-loading compute-intensive tasks to web-workers, very impressive visualizations
    can be made even without sacrificing a single FPS drop on UI thread.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-d36a7fda=""><div data-v-d36a7fda=""><p><img src="https://vitejs.dev/logo.svg"></p><p>Today we are excited to announce the official release of Vite 2.0!</p><p>Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced <code>/vit/</code>) is a new kind of build tool for frontend web development. Think a pre-configured dev server + bundler combo, but leaner and faster. It leverages browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native ES modules</a> support and tools written in compile-to-native languages like <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">esbuild</a> to deliver a snappy and modern development experience.</p><p>To get a sense of how fast Vite is, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1355379680275128321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video comparison</a> of booting up a React application on <a href="http://repl.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repl.it</a> using Vite vs. <code>create-react-app</code> (CRA).</p><p>If you've never heard of Vite before and would love to learn more about it, check out <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rationale behind the project</a>. If you are interested in how Vite differs from other similar tools, check out the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/comparisons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparisons</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-new-in-2-0"> What's New in 2.0</h2><p>Since we decided to completely refactor the internals before 1.0 got out of RC, this is in fact the first stable release of Vite. That said, Vite 2.0 brings about many big improvements over its previous incarnation:</p><h3 id="framework-agnostic-core"> Framework Agnostic Core</h3><p>The original idea of Vite started as a <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-dev-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacky prototype that serves Vue single-file components over native ESM</a>. Vite 1 was a continuation of that idea with HMR implemented on top.</p><p>Vite 2.0 takes what we learned along the way and is redesigned from scratch with a more robust internal architecture. It is now completely framework agnostic, and all framework-specific support is delegated to plugins. There are now <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official templates for Vue, React, Preact, Lit Element</a>, and ongoing community efforts for Svelte integration.</p><h3 id="new-plugin-format-and-api"> New Plugin Format and API</h3><p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/preactjs/wmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WMR</a>, the new plugin system extends Rollup's plugin interface and is <a href="https://vite-rollup-plugins.patak.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compatible with many Rollup plugins</a> out of the box. Plugins can use Rollup-compatible hooks, with additional Vite-specific hooks and properties to adjust Vite-only behavior (e.g. differentiating dev vs. build or custom handling of HMR).</p><p>The <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmatic API</a> has also been greatly improved to facilitate higher level tools / frameworks built on top of Vite.</p><h3 id="esbuild-powered-dep-pre-bundling"> esbuild Powered Dep Pre-Bundling</h3><p>Since Vite is a native ESM dev server, it pre-bundles dependencies to reduce the number browser requests and handle CommonJS to ESM conversion. Previously Vite did this using Rollup, and in 2.0 it now uses <code>esbuild</code> which results in 10-100x faster dependency pre-bundling. As a reference, cold-booting a test app with heavy dependencies like React Meterial UI previously took 28 seconds on an M1-powered Macbook Pro and now takes ~1.5 seconds. Expect similar improvements if you are switching from a traditional bundler based setup.</p><h3 id="first-class-css-support"> First-class CSS Support</h3><p>Vite treats CSS as a first-class citizen of the module graph and supports the following out of the box:</p><ul><li><strong>Resolver enhancement</strong>: <code>@import</code> and <code>url()</code> paths in CSS are enhanced with Vite's resolver to respect aliases and npm dependencies.</li><li><strong>URL rebasing</strong>: <code>url()</code> paths are automatically rebased regardless of where the file is imported from.</li><li><strong>CSS code splitting</strong>: a code-split JS chunk also emits a corresponding CSS file, which is automatically loaded in parallel with the JS chunk when requested.</li></ul><h3 id="server-side-rendering-ssr-support"> Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support</h3><p>Vite 2.0 ships with <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experimental SSR support</a>. Vite provides APIs to to efficiently load and update ESM-based source code in Node.js during development (almost like server-side HMR), and automatically externalizes CommonJS-compatible dependencies to improve development and SSR build speed. The production server can be completely decoupled from Vite, and the same setup can be easily adapted to perform pre-rendering / SSG.</p><p>Vite SSR is provided as a low-level feature and we are expecting to see higher level frameworks leveraging it under the hood.</p><h3 id="opt-in-legacy-browser-support"> Opt-in Legacy Browser Support</h3><p>Vite targets modern browsers with native ESM support by default, but you can also opt-in to support legacy browers via the official <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@vitejs/plugin-legacy</a>. The plugin automatically generates dual modern/legacy bundles, and delivers the right bundle based on browser feature detection, ensuring more efficient code in modern browsers that support them.</p><h2 id="give-it-a-try"> Give it a Try!</h2><p>That was a lot of features, but getting started with Vite is simple! You can spin up a Vite-powered app literally in a minute, starting with the following command (make sure you have Node.js &gt;=12):</p><p>Then, check out <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the guide</a> to see what Vite provides out of the box. You can also check out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, follow updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/vite_js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, or join discussions with other Vite users on our <a href="http://chat.vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord chat server</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

It can move us, make us feel, teach us things we never knew, open our eyes, and help us see the world from a completely different perspective. A book can alter the course of history and shape an entire civilisation. A book can change us to the very core.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>And yet at the same time, a book is just a collection of words placed in a specific sequential order. A complex literary algorithm crafted by its author. An algorithm that people might spend a lifetime studying, looking for meaning and answers, for inspiration and knowledge.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>What if we could beat that algorithm? Turn a book into something objective. Quantifiable. Analytical. So we can study the individual parts and learn new ways to read a text. If we look at books as datasets, we can see the statistical information within the writing, and discover insights that might otherwise be impossible to find.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>This is the first in a series of books to be transformed into data. Not just any books, but seminal books that have had a material impact on humanity. Using a custom made piece of software, we take the entire text of a book, and reorganise it alphabetically. That’s right. Each book completely reorganised from A-Z. This distils each text down to its lowest common denominator. It highlights the importance people tend to place on the order of said words – and their meaning – and allows for new and interesting interpretations of the written word, in much the same way as an abstract painting might.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>Starting with the first book in the series – “Bible The” – the entire King James Bible, reorganised and reprinted in alphabetical order. The result is a reductionist interpretation of the text that reveals some fascinating observations:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>BIBLE THE: Data suggests that The Bible skews towards a positive bias. For example, ‘Good’ is used 720 times, ‘bad’ only 18. ‘Love’ is used 308 times and ‘hate’ 87 times. And ‘happy’ less so, at 28 times, but still over twice as much as the 11 uses of ‘sad’.</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>‘Right’ features 358 times, ‘wrong’ just 26. ‘Light’ features 272 times, ‘dark’ only 43. ‘Pleasure’ 61 times, ‘pain’ 25. And ‘Life’ 451 times, still more than the 371 instances of ‘death’. This positive trait also translates into Biblical subject matter. For example, ‘Heaven’ features 582 times, whereas ‘hell’ only 54. There are 94 ‘angels’ to 55 ‘devils’, 96 ‘saints’ to 48 ‘sinners’, and 302 ‘blessed’ to a mere 3 ‘damned’, and a total of 27 ‘miracles’.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>On the other hand, there are 1,394 instances of ’no’, whilst the word ‘yes’ only appears 4 times in the entire Bible. There are 269 “enemies” to 49 “friends”, 8 ‘liars’ and 51 ‘lies’. 150 ‘heathens’, 63 ‘judged’, and 26 ‘guilty’, with 37 ‘crucified’, 30 ‘hanged’, and 71 ‘defiled’. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>Unsurprisingly, there is no ‘sex’ or ‘intercourse’ in The Bible, but there are 17 ‘concubines’, 9 ‘adulterers’, 8 ‘harlots’, 4 ‘sodomites’, 3 instances of ‘copulation’, 3 instances of ‘conception”, 2 ‘whores’, and 1 ‘prostitute’.</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>Socio-economically, there are twice as many ‘givers’ as ‘takers' – 93 ‘poor’ and 81 ‘rich’, 77 ‘rulers’, 237 ‘prophets’, ‘30 nobles’, 480 ‘servants’, 400 ‘priests’, 30 ‘soldiers’, 17 ‘publicans’, 27 ‘workers’, 5 ‘lawyers’, 9 carpenters, 1 ‘fishermen’, 6 ‘lepers’, 3 ‘beggar’s, and 1 ‘slave’.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>In terms of diversity, ‘White’ dominates by about 4:1, featuring 75 times, with ‘black’ just 18 times. But the Bible does appear to feature a diverse cast: 256 ‘Jews’, 254 ‘Philistines’, 98 ‘Egyptians’, 61 ‘Syrians’, 14 ‘Greeks’, 10 ‘Cushi’ (North Africans), 10 ‘Assyrians’, 7 ‘Romans’, 7 ‘Samaritans’, 5 ‘Persians’, 4 ‘Babylonians’, 2 ‘Libyans’, 2 ‘Christians’, a single ‘Arab’, and an equal amount of ‘believers’ and ‘infidels’.</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>Gender wise, the data suggests that The Bible is overwhelmingly biased towards males. At its most extreme, The Bible has 8,472 instances of the word ‘his’ and only a mere 3 instances of ‘hers’. And whilst this gender bias persist across the male-female divide, for the most part it is less pronounced. There are 1,653 references to ‘men’ and only 181 to ‘women’. ‘He’ is used 10,404 times, ‘she’ only 982. ‘Him’ 6,659 times to 1,994 uses of ‘her’. This bias extends beyond pronouns, to other gender specific identifiers: only 252 ‘daughters’ to 1,094 ‘sons’, only 8 ‘mothers’ to 548 ‘fathers’, only 4 uses of the term ‘lady’ to 7,830 uses of the term ‘Lord’, 3 ‘queens’ to 340 ‘kings’, and just 5 uses of ‘goddess’ to 4,440 uses of ‘god’.</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<h3><span><span><span><span>It is important to acknowledge that most people believe The Bible was written by men, almost 2000 years ago. Although their biases are most likely unconscious and cultural, their words speak for themselves. So does the data. And the data does not lie.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></h3></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yubikey is currently the de facto device for <span>U2F</span> authentication. It enables adding an extra layer of security on top of <span>SSH</span>, system login, signing <span>GPG</span> keys, and so on. It is also compatible with several other authentication methods, such as WebAuthn and <span>PAM</span>.</p>
<p>This post will show how to leverage your Yubikey for unlocking the system lock-screen, both with and without using a password. It will then delve into how to automatically lock the screen when the Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged.</p>
<p>To achieve logins with Yubikeys we require a <span>PAM</span> configuration. <span>PAM</span> or Pluggable Authentication Modules define the authentication flow for common Linux utilities, such as <code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, and <code>passwd</code>. We will override the default authentication flow for the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xlock">xlock</a> lock manager to allow logins with&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The above process should be similar across most lock managers, such as <code>i3lock</code> or <code>xscreensaver</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Creating a <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;configuration</h2>
<p>We shall first replicate the default authentication provided with xlock using <span>PAM</span>. With this configuration the user should only be able to log in with their&nbsp;password.</p>
<p>All <span>PAM</span> configuration files lie under the <code>/etc/pam.d/</code> directory. We create a file named <code>xlock</code> which replicates the default&nbsp;authentication:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/pam.d/xlock
<span>#%PAM-1.0</span>
auth            include         system-auth
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For the above configuration file to take effect the tool (<code>xlock</code>) must be <span>PAM</span> compatible. We can confirm that <code>xlock</code> is <span>PAM</span> compatible by inspecting the output of <code>ldd /usr/bin/xlock | grep libpam.so</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first comment line indicates the <span>PAM</span> version. The lines that follow define the authentication&nbsp;flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>auth</code> is the module interface responsible for verifying the user’s&nbsp;password.</li>
<li><code>include</code> is the <span>PAM</span> control flag which <em>includes</em> the <code>system-auth</code> configuration file (this file defines the default authentication flow). This flag can also be used to load modules, as we shall see&nbsp;later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There is an excellent <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/managing_smart_cards/pam_configuration_files">documentation</a> provided by RedHat on <span>PAM</span> configuration&nbsp;files.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Supporting Yubikey&nbsp;logins</h3>
<p>We shall now add Yubikey login functionality to our <span>PAM</span> configuration, but we first need to install the Yubico module for <span>PAM</span> and set it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Yubico, the company behind Yubikeys, exposes the <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/">pam_yubico.so</a> module which can be used for Yubikey&nbsp;authentication.</p>
<p>It provides two authentication mechanisms, the <code>client</code> mode and the <code>challenge-response</code> mode. The <code>client</code> mode sends a request to the Yubico server for verifying the user’s <span>OTP</span>, and requires an active Internet connection for the user to login. As this is inconvenient we shall only explore the <code>challenge-response</code> mode in this&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the configuration the <code>pam_yubico</code> package must be installed manually. This package is easily available across most Linux distributions. On Arch Linux it can be installed&nbsp;with:</p>

<p>We next add Yubikey mappings before setting the challenge-response&nbsp;credential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: It is recommended that you use a secondary account to perform the next steps as there is a risk of permanently locking your account (in case of <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;misconfiguration).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Adding&nbsp;mappings</h4>
<p>Each Yubikey must be paired with a unique public <span>ID</span> which the <code>pam_yubico</code> module uses to uniquely identify the user. The public <span>ID</span> consists of the first 12 characters extracted from the <span>OTP</span>&nbsp;token.</p>
<p>To obtain your Yubikey’s public <span>ID</span> open up your shell and press the Yubikey button. You will see a similar output as&nbsp;below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>vvctffbvkhdnliklfhbbfiecudthfvrvuhnhtirehidr</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now copy take the first 12 characters (<code>vvctffbvkhdn</code>) and add them to a file named <code>yubikey_mappings</code> in the <code>/etc/</code> directory, along with your username. In our case this will&nbsp;be:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/yubikey_mappings
adeel:vvctffbvkhdn
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This file also allows specifying multiple Yubikey mappings, each separated by a new&nbsp;line.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Setting the challenge response&nbsp;credential</h4>
<p>Yubikey needs to somehow verify the generated <span>OTP</span> (One Time Password) when it tries to authenticate the user. It does so by using the <code>challenge-response</code> mode.</p>
<p>To set up the <code>challenge-response</code> mode, we first need to install the Yubikey manager tool called <code>ykman</code>. On Arch Linux it can be installed&nbsp;with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ pacman -S yubikey-manger
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>ykman</code> tool will generate a secret credential and store it in a local file. Whenever the user tries to login with <code>xlock</code>, the <code>pam_yubico</code> module will verify the generated <span>OTP</span> against the stored&nbsp;credential.</p>
<p>The challenge response credential can be set on slot 2 of the Yubikey&nbsp;with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ykman otp chalresp --generate <span>2</span>
Using a randomly generated key: 29eb38b6f50b246c46f954af9710a77c78792114
Program a challenge-response credential in slot <span>2</span>? <span>[</span>y/N<span>]</span>: y
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Ensure that the slot you’re writing the data to doesn’t already contain any credential, as it might not be&nbsp;recoverable!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the <code>challenge-response</code> credential is set it needs to be written to a local file which will be later read by <code>pam_yubico</code>.</p>
<p>Yubico provides another tool called <code>ykpamcfg</code> (which should be bundled with the <code>yubikey-manger</code> package) to write this file to disk. It takes the Yubikey slot number as its parameter and writes the secret to a&nbsp;file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ykpamcfg -2
Stored initial challenge and expected response in <span>'/home/adeel/.yubico/challenge-&lt;Serial ID&gt;'</span>.
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Updating the Linux <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;configuration</h3>
<p>We shall now update the <code>/etc/pam.d/xlock</code> file and add the Yubico <span>PAM</span> at the very&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/pam.d/xlock
<span>#%PAM-1.0</span>

auth  sufficient  pam_yubico.so debug <span>mode</span><span>=</span>challenge-response <span>authfile</span><span>=</span>/etc/yubikey_mappings
auth  include     system-auth
</code></pre></div>
<p>We pass three parameters to the <code>pam_yubico.so</code> module:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debug</code> prints all the authentication steps to the console when the ‘Enter’ key is&nbsp;pressed.</li>
<li><code>mode</code> specifies which mode the module will use for authentication (<code>challenge-response</code> or <code>client</code>).</li>
<li><code>authfile</code> points to the credential file written by the <code>ykpamcfg</code> tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the module type to <code>sufficient</code> means that if Yubikey authentication succeeds, no further steps will be processed and the user will get logged in. This is the key point which enables passwordless logins. However, in the event of authentication failure, remaining authentication steps will still be applied, i.e. the user can still log in with their password if the Yubikey is not plugged&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>If the module type is set to <code>required</code> instead of <code>sufficient</code> it will enable Two-Factor Authentication (<span>2FA</span>) which will require the user to plug in their Yubikey <em>and</em> enter their password to&nbsp;login.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For passwordless logins the user will need to press the <code>Enter</code> with their Yubikey plugged in to unlock their&nbsp;screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage you should be able unlock your screen with they&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You may need to replug your Yubikey for the changes to take&nbsp;effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Automatically locking the screen when Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged</h2>
<p>Up till locking the screen still requires manually invoking the <code>xlock</code> command. It would be nice if we can somehow automatically lock the screen whenever our Yubikey is unplugged. We can achieve this with&nbsp;Udev.</p>
<p>Udev is the device manager used in Linux which can be used for a myriad of tasks. It tracks the state changes for all external devices, for example, it can be used to identify when a <span>USB</span> device is plugged or unplugged. Each device outputs a series of attributes which can be used to uniquely identify&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>We shall use these attributes to create a Udev rule which triggers an <code>xlock.service</code> Systemd service when the Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: We can also achieve this with a Shell script instead of Systemd, but Udev discourages executing long-running programs using scripts as it terminates them after a certain time&nbsp;period.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating the Systemd&nbsp;service</h3>
<p>Systemd is the Linux service manager which can be used to launch user processes. We create a file named <code>xlock.service</code> in the <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/systemd/system/xlock.service
<span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>xlock

<span>[</span>Service<span>]</span>
<span>User</span><span>=</span>adeel
<span>Type</span><span>=</span>simple
<span>Environment</span><span>=</span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>/usr/bin/xlock 

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>multi-user.target
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Type=simple</code> implies that this service does not exit after&nbsp;execution.</li>
<li>The <code>Environment</code> tag specifies which display should be locked (<code>0</code> is the default&nbsp;display).</li>
<li>The <code>ExecStart</code> tag takes a path of the binary or script it will&nbsp;execute.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Consult the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">official docs</a> to explore Systemd in&nbsp;detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating the Udev&nbsp;rule</h3>
<p>We first need to identify a set of unique attributes for our device (Yubikey). The <code>udevadm</code> tool allows monitoring Udev output whenever a device state changes. We shall invoke the following command and then remove our&nbsp;Yubikey:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ udevadm monitor --environment --udev 
monitor will print the received events <span>for</span>:
UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing

UDEV  <span>[</span><span>461872</span>.738673<span>]</span> remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-2/1-2.1/1-2.1:1.0/0003:1050:0407.0157/input/input294/event18 <span>(</span>input<span>)</span>
<span>ACTION</span><span>=</span>remove
<span>ID_VENDOR</span><span>=</span>Yubico
<span>SUBSYSTEM</span><span>=</span>input
<span>DEVNAME</span><span>=</span>/dev/input/event18
<span>ID_INPUT_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>
...
</code></pre></div>
<p>We only show a truncated output above, but once you have identified the attributes you would like to use, create a file named <code>yubikey-actions.rules</code> in the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/</code> directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey-actions.rules 
<span>ACTION</span><span>==</span><span>"remove"</span>, ENV<span>{</span>ID_MODEL_ID<span>}==</span><span>"0407"</span>, ENV<span>{</span>ID_VENDOR_ID<span>}==</span><span>"1050"</span>, <span>RUN</span><span>+=</span><span>"/usr/bin/systemctl start xlock.service"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It might be worthwhile to reload the configuration for both Systemd and&nbsp;Udev:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ udevadm control --reload
</code></pre></div>
<p>If everything worked out fine your screen should now get locked whenever you remove your&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>

	<p>The distributed application runtime is now production ready</p>
	
	
	<p>Today we are excited to announce the <a href="https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.0.0">v1.0 release</a> of the Distributed Application Runtime (<a href="https://dapr.io/">Dapr</a>), which has achieved the stability and enterprise readiness to be designated production ready. Dapr is an open source, portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice, stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. Dapr enables developers to focus on writing business logic and not solving distributed system challenges, thereby significantly improving their productivity, and reducing development time. Dapr lowers the bar for entry to build modern cloud native applications based on a microservices architecture and with this v1.0 release, Dapr applications can be deployed to self-hosted infrastructure or Kubernetes clusters in production scenarios.</p>
<p>Since its <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/10/16/announcing-dapr-open-source-project-build-microservice-applications/">first release in Oct 2019</a>, Dapr has had <a href="https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tags">14 releases</a>, each one building on tremendous community and user feedback to drive improvements, stability and performance. These releases were grounded in building real applications that reflect what developers are doing today when developing cloud native applications; whether on cloud, edge or private infrastructure, and with the community stepping up to contribute Dapr components that integrate with Azure, AWS, Alibaba and Google clouds.</p>
<h2 id="solving-distributed-application-challenges-in-real-world-scenarios">Solving distributed application challenges in real world scenarios</h2>
<p>From its founding, the Dapr open source project is for developers who are building new real world greenfield applications as well as those migrating and leveraging existing applications and components in cloud-native architectures. Key to Dapr’s approach is to meet developers and enterprises where they are today, helping to modernize their applications, and leverage their existing skills in cloud native and micro-services architecture. In the v1.0 release we have focused on Kubernetes as the primary hosting environment to run production applications, and as Dapr matures further we expect to see Dapr in serverless environments. We’ve worked closely with early adopters and partners over the past one and half years, and as a result Dapr is now at the core of several production and pre-production Kubernetes-based applications. In this user driven journey, the Dapr community has improved the native language experiences of the Java, .NET and Python SDKs, tested scale and performance with real workloads, added security features, and proven that Dapr’s actor programming model is the best choice for workflow and IoT scenarios. Here are some of the early adopter stories to highlight how Dapr is being used today.</p>
<h3 id="zeiss-an-international-technology-leader-in-optics-and-opto-electronics">ZEISS, an international technology leader in optics and opto-electronics</h3>
<p>The challenge for ZEISS was maintaining and updating a 20-year-old back-end system with hard-coded business rules. The original order validation and routing solution was based on a monolithic architecture with fixed capacities where developers couldn’t easily update, reroute, or track orders without reconfiguring tables directly in the system. In addition, business units had no direct control over their order processing flow. With so many system dependencies, changes always required costly, time-consuming developer intervention. To overcome this, ZEISS developed a new application using Azure and Dapr to fulfill orders faster for customers, while also speeding up development and improving business continuity for the company. You can read more about their story <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1336089737047375040-zeiss-accelerates-cloud-first-development-on-azure-and-streamlines-order-processing">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/02/17/announcing-dapr-v1.0/zeiss-diagram.png" width="2000"></p><h3 id="ignition-group-a-south-africa-based-technology-business-focusing-on-customer-engagement-and-sales-support-tools">Ignition Group, a South Africa-based technology business focusing on customer engagement and sales-support tools</h3>
<p>Ignition Group builds order processing software to track products, manage subscriptions, and handle payments from a variety of sources. Order processing involves many dependencies with a purchase tracking mechanism that invokes a customer subscription, triggers accounting and billing processes, and determines the appropriate payment channel. Ignition Group wanted the benefits that microservices would bring to its workflow logic—high availability, resiliency, scalability, and performance. Using Dapr and .NET Core, Ignition Group built a new, more scalable, maintainable order processing and payment system which is now running in production. Ignition Group are running in production today and you can read more about their story <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1335733425802443016-ignition-group-speeds-development-and-payment-processing-using-dapr-and-azure">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="roadwork-data-gathering-to-gain-insights">Roadwork, data gathering to gain insights</h3>
<p>Roadwork is a startup that provides an end-to-end platform for autonomous systems, enabling users to generate actionable insights and act on them. Currently they are focused on data extraction techniques, with a path towards fully integrated autonomous systems. By combing Dapr with <a href="https://keda.sh/">KEDA</a> they created a production service on Kubernetes that automatically scales both the application and the cluster based on the incoming customer load requests. Dapr provided the abstraction and integration with pub/sub using RabbitMQ and its ability to easily have a <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/pubsub-overview/#consumer-groups-and-competing-consumers-pattern">competing consumer pattern</a>. Roadwork’s first product, <a href="https://scraper.ai/">Scraper.ai</a> is already running in production today.

<p>Getting Dapr to the v1.0 has been a community effort. It has been amazing to see the open source community rally around Dapr and grow since it was first announced – growing from a little over 114 contributors in October 2019 to 700 today. A growth of over six-fold in only 16 months!</p>
<p>Community contributions to the project have gone to every Dapr repo and have ranged from opening issues, commenting on feature proposals, providing samples, and of course contributing code. The parts of the project community members have contributed to the most include the Dapr runtime, docs, CLI and SDKs. One additional key area of contribution has been the creation of a rich ecosystem of components. Having over 70 components available to developers makes Dapr a solution for a wide range of scenarios and includes both open source technologies and cloud provider specific integrations. These make Dapr an appealing choice for developers looking to create cloud agnostic applications with high portability.</p>
<p>Contributions have not been limited to individuals, but also included organizations such as Alibaba Cloud, HashiCorp, Microsoft and the early adopters like ZEISS and Ignition Group mentioned above. The Dapr ecosystem also includes partner technology stacks that provide added value to developers who use them with Dapr. For example, New Relic has provided <a href="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/01/26/observing-dapr-applications-with-new-relic-one/">guidance</a> on how their monitoring tools seamlessly work with Dapr thanks to Dapr’s use of standard tracing protocols that easily instrument your application without any code changes.</p>
<p>Fostering an open and inclusive community is a primary goal for the Dapr project. As part of that commitment, we shared the <a href="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2020/09/30/transitioning-the-dapr-project-to-open-governance/">transition to an open governance model</a> which is how we aim to keep Dapr open, vendor neutral and inclusive. Our vision is to continue this journey and intend to have Dapr join an open software foundation in the near future. In the meantime, we invite you to engage with the Dapr community over <a href="https://github.com/dapr">GitHub</a>, the regular Dapr <a href="https://github.com/dapr/community#community-meetings">community calls</a> and the recently launched <a href="https://aka.ms/dapr-discord">Discord server</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At Alibaba Cloud, we believe Dapr will lead the evolution of microservices. By adopting Dapr, our customers now enjoy increased velocity for building portable and robust distributed systems."</em>
<strong>-	Xiang Li, Senior Staff Engineer, Alibaba Cloud</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="release-highlights">Release highlights</h2>
<p>Over the last few months we have published three v1.0 release candidates to focus on getting feedback from the community and preparing for the v1.0 release. This included a deeper focus on production readiness, in areas such as performance, security, High Availability (HA) and conformance. The full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.0.0">here</a>, these are some of the highlights:</p>
<h3 id="kubernetes-as-a-production-environment">Kubernetes as a production environment</h3>
<p>For the v1.0 release, Kubernetes is the primary hosting environment, and it is <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-overview/">deeply integrated with both the Dapr control plane and Dapr sidecar architecture</a>. For example, operationally installing and upgrading Dapr to Kubernetes is simplified with Dapr CLI “init” and “upgrade” commands that pull down the correct Dapr runtime versions and ensure that these are rolled out in a controlled manner, including migrating certificates that are in use. You can install the Dapr control plan in HA mode ensuring that multiple instances are running and the Dapr side car has a health endpoint that enable Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes to determine its health state. Throughout the release candidate process, we have worked closely with early adopters to ensure that they can operationally migrate to each Dapr runtime release, rather than building new clusters. See these <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-production/">guidelines for production deployment</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="performance-conformance-and-support">Performance, conformance, and support</h3>
<p>Performance is critical in cloud native applications and Dapr puts a premium on high performance. A topic that often gets raised are the implications of having a side car model doing all the heavy lifting for your application and the trade off with data plane performance. One area of particular focus is with the service invocation building block, and here, when calling between two applications through two Dapr sidecars and receiving a response back, <a href="https://docs.dapr.io/operations/performance-and-scalability/perf-service-invocation/">Dapr adds ~1.2ms end-to-end latency at the 90th percentile and ~2ms at the 99th percentile</a>. This shows that Dapr has extremely low service-to-service latency and has been optimized for high throughput scenarios. Dapr has over 70 components developed by the community and to ensure confidence in the usage of these, they go through a set of conformance tests. Components first start in an alpha status and eventually get to GA status, which requires users to be using them in production. Only a subset of components are GA approved for v1.0 release, with these having been used extensively in production, with others joining them as they meet the criteria. As with many open source cloud native technologies, changes, fixes and improvements are …</p></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal">first post</a> in the Ruby Garbage Collection Deep Dive series, we went through a few definitions to give us a picture of how Ruby stores values in memory. If you haven’t read it yet, <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal">read it first</a>! We’ll build on those definitions in this post. Particularly, we’ll talk more about the Ruby Heap, Pages, Slots and RVALUES.</p>

<p>Okay, now that we have those baseline definitions out of the way, this post is going to explain the algorithm Ruby’s garbage collector uses to determine which objects it can collect: the Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm. There are two phases to this algorithm. You guessed it: marking and sweeping. In the marking phase, the garbage collector marks all slots which contain accessible RVALUES. In the sweeping phase, the garbage collector clears the RVALUES out of all slots which are not marked. Let’s dig in!</p>

<h2 id="tri-color-mark-and-sweep">Tri-Color Mark and Sweep</h2>

<h3 id="marking">Marking</h3>

<p>We’ll start off by discussing the marking phase. This is most straightforward to understand if we imagine the <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/ObjectSpace.html">Ruby ObjectSpace</a> to be a directed graph with root nodes. All of the nodes in the graphs are RVALUES. All of the edges in the graph are references from one RVALUE to another.</p>

<p>Ruby’s garbage collector starts at the root nodes and traces every edge it can access from these root nodes, marking every RVALUE it sees through this process. At the end, any RVALUE which was not traced, and therefore not accessible from a root RVALUE will be garbage collected.</p>

<h4 id="tri-color">Tri-Color</h4>

<p>Okay, but the algorithm Ruby uses for garbage collection is called a Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm, so what’s the Tri-Color part all about? The Tri-Color algorithm is a model we can use to understand what Ruby’s garbage collector is doing, and how tracks its progress. The three colors in the Tri-Color algorithm (three shades, really) are white, black and grey.</p>

<p>At the beginning of garbage collection, every slot in the Ruby Heap is white. Then, as part of the initial setup, all slots which contain root RVALUEs are marked as grey.</p>

<p>Root RVALUES are all of the RVALUES that a Ruby program knows it will need to run. Examples of these are RVALUES that exist on the stack of instructions that the program is following, or protected global variables.</p>

<p>With all root slots grey, and all other slots white, we then get to the crux of the algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>grey_slots</span><span>.</span><span>empty?</span><span>)</span>
  <span>current_slot</span> <span>=</span> <span>grey_slots</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span>
  <span>grey_slots</span> <span>+=</span> <span>current_slot</span><span>.</span><span>referenced_slots</span>
  <span>black_slots</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>current_slot</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We iterate over all grey slots, coloring the slots that their RVALUES reference grey, and coloring themselves black. The algorithm continues until there are no grey slots left. At this point, any black slots contain RVALUES which were reachable by the RVALUEs in the root slots, and any white slots do not contain RVALUES which were reachable so can be swept away!</p>

<p>For the visual learners, here’s a gif of what the algorithm is doing:</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/mark.gif" alt="mark-gif"></p>

<h4 id="references">References</h4>

<p>There is one detail which needs further explanation here: how does an RVALUE know which other RVALUES it references?</p>

<p>It depends on the type of object. For Ruby builtins, tracing the references are just baked into the garbage collector code itself. For example, to find all references from an array RVALUE, the collector iterates each element in the array and finds its references. For a hash, it will do this for both the keys and the values. This all happens in the garbage collector’s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/296a2cab07ce530809ee74dee61180fbb3ca6f91/gc.c#L6269"><code>mark_children</code></a> method.</p>

<p>But, when objects are defined by C extensions, the C extensions must mark all child objects on their own. We’ll dive more into this in a future C extensions post (which I’ll backlink here).</p>

<p>Okay, so now that we understand how we find all accessbile objects, we need to learn how to dispose of all unaccessible objects.</p>

<h3 id="sweeping">Sweeping</h3>

<p>At this point, we have two sets: black slots and white slots. Internally, these are represented as a <code>marked</code> bitmap. Every Page on the Ruby Heap has its own <code>marked</code> bitmap with one bit per slot. A <code>1</code> bit means the slot is accessible, or Black in our Tri-Color scheme. A <code>0</code> bit means that the slot is no longer accessible, or White in our Tri-Color scheme.</p>

<p>In addition to holding this <code>marked</code> bitmap, each page also has a <code>freelist</code> which represents slots on that page which do not have live objects. The garbage collector iterates over all pages, finding all slots which are not marked. Where applicable, the garbage collector then adds the unmarked slots to each page’s freelist. If the RVALUES which were occupying these slots are also taking up space in the operating system heap, it also frees this memory.</p>

<p>Once pages have been swept, there might be pages which are now completely unallocated; they have no slots which contain RVALUES. These pages are referred to as “Tomb Pages.” Tomb pages have their memory completely returned to the operating system’s heap. This is really helpful for memory management. It means that sweeping can result in freeing memory, or diminishing the overall size of the Ruby Heap.</p>

<p>Any pages with at least one occupied slot are called “Eden Pages”. The sweeping phase might reduce the number of occupied slots in an Eden Page. The garbage collector will use the freelists from Eden Pages for future object allocations. That is to say, if you instantiate an object, the garbage collector will look for one of these free slots in an Eden Page and place the RVALUE representing your object in there.</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/eden-and-tomb.png" alt="eden-and-tomb"></p>

<p>There is one more nuance here. As of Ruby 3.0, if auto-compaction is enabled, compaction will actually happen as part of the sweeping phase. A more in depth explanation of how and why this happens will follow in a later post about compaction in this Garbage Collection Deep Dive Series.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>The Tri-Color mark and sweep algorithm is what Ruby’s garbage collector uses to determine which slots hold objects which no longer have accessible references. It marks all of the slots it has references to by following the Tri-Color algorithm in which it follows all references from root RVALUES. Once the garbage collector knows which objects are accessible from the roots, it can begin the sweep phase, where it will add the unoccupied slots to each page’s freelist, and release any operating system memory those RVALUES held. This enables the slots to be reused for new object allocation.</p>

<p>Here are a few new definitions we learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Eden page</strong>: A page which contains slots with RVALUES, might also have empty slots</li>
  <li><strong>Tomb page</strong>: A page which contains only empty slots</li>
  <li><strong>Free list</strong>: A linked list per Heap Page of empty slots</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s it for this post! I’m going to continue writing blog posts in this series, and am also writing a book about managed garbage collection, with a focus on Ruby.

<p><time>16 February 2021</time></p>

<p><i>18 Feb: See below for some nice updates!</i></p>

<p>Programming languages advance by introducing new constraints. A key reason we
don’t use assembly language for everything is that the lack of constraints make
it too hard to use for everyday programming. Before <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF"><code>goto</code>
was considered harmful</a>, people wrote machine code that jumped all over the
place, and programmers had to maintain a mental model of the complete machine
state and the full implications of each jump — a recipe for bugs.</p>

<p>Then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured
programming</a> was introduced: structured languages still compiled down to
<code>goto</code>s (or arbitrary jumps), but the programmer could think in terms
of more limited jumps: <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code>,
<code>call</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>for</code>. These constrained
jumps are much easier to understand; for example, when you’re reading code, you
can know that <code>return</code> doesn’t return just anywhere. It returns only
to the caller, as identified by a pointer on the stack. Later, language
designers added additional constrained jumps like
<code>throw</code>/<code>catch</code>, and virtual function calls.</p>

<p>(<code>throw</code> is a little bit too <code>goto</code>-y for my taste,
since you can’t tell locally where the relevant <code>catch</code> block is. But
that’s a story for another time.)</p>

<p>A key innovation of C++ was to introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization">RAII</a>,
which essentially ‘piggybacks’ on the value of the stack and enriches it with a
lot more power. (The additional complexity is usually manageable, and worth it.)
It allows you extend the automatic memory management that the stack provides,
initializing and cleaning up complex resources instead of just primitive values
like integers and floats. You can automatically close open files, release
dynamic storage, and so on. And it’s deterministic.</p>

<p>But there was still the problem of the heap: a free-fire zone with no
constraints, riddled with memory leaks (heap resources allocated but never
released) and use-after-free bugs (heap resources re-used even after having been
released).</p>

<p>A key innovation of Rust has been to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html">statically
constrain the lifetimes of heap resources</a>, enabling us to more completely
solve the worst remaining memory unsafety problem. (Previous solutions to the
heap lifetime problem were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">dynamic</a>,
not static, and hence expensive in space and time — as well as being
non-deterministic. These limitations reduce the applicability of
dynamically-managed languages to applications and environments where these costs
are affordable.)</p>

<p>And, of course, taming object lifetimes greatly eases the problem of safe,
efficient concurrency. Concurrency is the key to improving performance in modern
systems.</p>

<p>Beyond memory safety, Rust makes more use of typefulness than I typically see
in other mainstream languages in its niche. For example, Rust’s rich
<code>enum</code>s and pattern matching make it easier to write state machines,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html">the
new type idiom</a> makes it easier to get additional type safety (and improves
the interface-as-documentation factor), and so on. You can work to get similar
benefits in other languages, but Rust’s syntactic mechanisms and idiomatic usage
create affordances for these easier patterns.</p>

<p>Another freeing constraint Rust has introduced has been to systematize and
automate dependency management: the Cargo package management system. Good
dependency management is a <a href="https://research.swtch.com/deps">monstrously
hard problem</a>. Any dependency management system, including manual or ad hoc
management, poses a variety of problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Version conflicts:</b> Inevitably, the latest version of the foo package
has changed its API in such a way that it can’t interoperate with the bar
package. Now resolve these conflicts all up and down the dependency tree.
Fun!</li>

<li><b>Supply-chain security:</b> When you pull in a dependency, you must trust
the transitive closure of all the authors who have committed to that dependency
sub-tree. This includes not just the code and the programs you can build with
it, but build scripts themselves.</li>

<li><b>Micro- and even pico-dependencies:</b> The tendency to multiply the
previous 2 problems by creating <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd">extremely tiny</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even">single-use packages</a>.</li>

<li><b>Proliferation:</b> The tendency to multiply the previous 3 problems by
creating several packages that serve the same basic need, leading to a situation
in which effort solving the same problem is fragmented — including
documentation, training, code reviewer/auditor hours, and so on. (I call this
the “Occam’s Razor now has <a href="https://www.theonion.com/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades-1819584036">5
blades</a>” problem.)</li>

</ul>

<p>The NPM ecosystem provides the clearest modern illustration of these
problems. (See page 11 of <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/static/github-octoverse-2020-security-report.pdf">Github’s
report on security</a>, for example.)</p>

<p>However, for all of NPM’s problems, <b>at least it is a package management
system at all</b>! It’s easy to pick on NPM (or predecessors like <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, or <a href="https://ctan.org/">CTAN</a>,
or...), but even at its worst it’s a <b>huge improvement</b> over manually
managing dependencies (such as by manually vendoring them into your source tree,
or just telling the user to install such-and-such libraries before attempting to
compile).</p>

<p>Life is better with NPM, and with Rust’s Cargo, Go’s <code>go get</code>, and
so on. Even when they aren’t perfect yet, they provide a framework for
improvement, by constraining where dependencies come from and how we maintain
them.</p>

<p>But a lot of work is still necessary. As an example of a Nice Thing Indeed,
Cargo has this add-on package called <a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-supply-chain">supply-chain</a>,
which will show you all the packages a given package depends on. It will also
estimate how many individual publishers author those dependencies. Here is what
happens when you run supply-chain on itself:</p>

<pre>~/src/rust/cargo-supply-chain % <b>cargo supply-chain publishers</b>

The following crates will be ignored because they come from a local directory:
 - cargo-supply-chain

The `crates.io` cache was not found or it is invalid.
  Run `cargo supply-chain update` to generate it.

Fetching publisher info from crates.io
This will take roughly 2 seconds per crate due to API rate limits
Fetching data for "adler" (0/79)
[<i>77 items, including some surprising ones, elided...</i>]
Fetching data for "xattr" (78/79)

The following individuals can publish updates for your dependencies:

 1. alexcrichton via crates: flate2, wasm-bindgen-backend, wasi, bitflags, proc-macro2, wasm-bindgen-macro, wasm-bindgen, openssl-probe, unicode-xid, wasm-bindgen-macro-support, filetime, semver, tar, unicode-normalization, libc, js-sys, bumpalo, log, wasm-bindgen-shared, cfg-if, cc, web-sys
 [<i>55 authors elided...</i>]
 57. zesterer via crates: spin

Note: there may be outstanding publisher invitations. crates.io provides no way to list them.
Invitations are also impossible to revoke, and they never expire.
See https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/2868 for more info.

All members of the following teams can publish updates for your dependencies:

 1. "github:rustwasm:core" (https://github.com/rustwasm) via crates: web-sys, js-sys, wasm-bindgen-macro, wasm-bindgen-macro-support, wasm-bindgen-backend, wasm-bindgen, wasm-bindgen-shared
 2. "github:servo:cargo-publish" (https://github.com/servo) via crates: core-foundation-sys, percent-encoding, form_urlencoded, unicode-bidi, core-foundation, idna, url
 3. "github:servo:rust-url" (https://github.com/servo) via crates: percent-encoding, form_urlencoded, idna, url
 4. "github:rust-bus:maintainers" (https://github.com/rust-bus) via crates: security-framework-sys, security-framework, tinyvec
 5. "github:rust-lang-nursery:libs" (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery) via crates: bitflags, log, lazy_static
 6. "github:serde-rs:owners" (https://github.com/serde-rs) via crates: serde_derive, serde, serde_json
 7. "github:rust-lang:libs" (https://github.com/rust-lang) via crates: libc, cfg-if
 8. "github:rust-lang-nursery:log-owners" (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery) via crates: log
 9. "github:rust-random:maintainers" (https://github.com/rust-random) via crates: getrandom

Github teams are black boxes. It's impossible to get the member list without explicit permission.

~/src/rust/cargo-supply-chain % <b>cargo supply-chain update</b>
Note: this will download large amounts of data (approximately 250Mb).
On a slow network this will take a while.
</pre>

<p>Now, that’s a lot of dependencies by a lot of publishers whom I don’t know.
(Although it’s not automated, if you dig around you’ll find that many of those
authors are well-established members of the Rust development team, so trusting
them is an easier sell.) Another bummer is that, when I built supply-chain, my
default <code>$CFLAGS</code> broke the build (<b>Update 18 Feb:</b> with an
almost certainly spurious and not security-relevant warning,
<code>-Wunused-macros</code>). (My flags are quite persnickety:
<code>-Weverything -Werror -std=c11</code>. Very little code builds with these
flags. 😇) Apparently, some of supply-chain’s own dependencies depend on C code.
Alas.</p>

<p>But that’s OK! Cargo provides a framework for working on these problems. Over
time, I’d like to see things move along these lines:</p>

<ul>

<li>Replace C/C++ dependencies with Rust, and reduce the use of
<code>unsafe</code>. This has been happening, and will continue to, over time.
(See <a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/safety-dance">the Safety Dance
project</a>, which is a focused on reducing the use of
<code>unsafe</code>.)</li>

<li>Coalesce the most common dependencies into a (semi-)official ‘extended
<code>std</code>’, so that they can appear as a single dependency with a single
publishing team. This is controversial in some communities, but I think it would
go a long way toward reducing the problems.</li>

<li>Obviate some of the micro-dependencies by folding them into larger, more
general packages including the language itself, <code>std</code>, and ‘extended
<code>std</code>’ (where and if appropriate). This is also sometimes
controversial, but again I think it would help.</li>

<li>Perhaps supply-chain, check, clippy, or a new tool could provide some
indication of a package’s reputation or something like what the Perl community
jokingly calls <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Kwalitee">kwalitee</a>:
Not quality, but overall ‘smells’. Good test coverage? Is the package version
greater than 1.0? Actively maintained? Frequently used? Maintained by the same
people for a long time? A low proportion of lines of code in <code>unsafe</code>
blocks, or in C/C++/assembly? Some of these things can be more or less</li></ul></div></div>

    <p>Almost exactly one year ago I quit my job to create a Haskell startup as a solo developer. I had about 20 ideas, but eventually settled on the idea of dependency project health tracking with <a href="https://deadpendency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadpendency</a>.</p>

<p>This post describes the experience and evaluates Haskell and its ecosystem.</p>

<p><small>Disclaimer: This blog post contains a bunch of memes. They are trying to be humorous, not accurate or fair 😉.</small></p>

<h2 id="why-haskell">Why Haskell?</h2>

<p>Since about 2016 I have had a strong <del>obsession</del> love of Haskell. Prior to learning Haskell, I was an experienced OO style developer but I didn’t really know how to keep improving my raw programming ability. Haskell introduced me to the world of functional programming (FP) which has an almost infinite depth of concepts to learn, which do actually help improve code quality and application architecture.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9eeq.jpg" alt="I should learn functional programming meme"></p>

<p>Haskell is challenging to learn, but extremely fun to write. For my own learning and pleasure, if my startup succeeds, I want to be doing Haskell.</p>

<p>Additionally, I think Haskell is the best general purpose programming language (that you can use in production). In particular, Haskell excels at writing ‘boring’ business applications which is typically what I work on. <a href="https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘Why Haskell For Production’</a> goes into more detail on the benefits Haskell offers.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9fwz.jpg" alt="Haskell is the best change my mind meme"></p>

<h2 id="the-setup-phase">The Setup Phase</h2>

<p>Probably the most challenging part was building out a skeleton architecture to hang my business logic on. I decided to go with, even within Haskell, fairly advanced libraries of <a href="https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>servant</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fused-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>fused-effects</code></a>.</p>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time banging my head against a wall trying to get these libraries to work nicely together. This was primarily from a lack of Haskell ability on my part. I had prepared as best I could, but Haskell is deep and I needed to learn more to work day to day with it. I was lucky enough to eventually find <a href="https://github.com/mitchellwrosen/hspolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example</a> that marries these two libraries together, which was a life saver. I’m sure I would have gotten there eventually, but I was in a bit over my head at that point.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9j14.jpg" alt="Haskell with servant fused-effects is hard meme"></p>

<p>Haskell is awesome, but like most languages there is cruft and legacy to be avoided. Haskell has a standard library known as <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>base</code></a> which unfortunately has a fair amount of unsafe or unperformant functions included. As such I went with an alternative standard library <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/relude" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>relude</code></a> that builds on and improves <code>base</code>. On top of this, there are many core libraries that are not part of the standard library I wanted to use and have nice patterns around.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was <a href="https://alistairb.dev/haskell-on-google-cloud-is-great">deploying to google cloud</a> and so needed to figure out good patterns for that integration from Haskell.</p>

<p>This setup effort was quite challenging. I spent most of it squinting at compiler errors. Yet it only took about 2 weeks to have a good foundation of code to start building my business logic upon.</p>

<h2 id="building-it-out">Building it Out</h2>

<p>This is when it started to get really fun. I had my core patterns set out and I could focus on building a pipeline. The day in day out of writing out my logic as small pure functions that I composed together was very nice.</p>

<p>Haskell has such impressive auto-magic code generation techniques that you spend much more time focused on the interesting logic of your application rather than boilerplate.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>HappinessLevel</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Miserable</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Sad</span>

<span>-- ok not really magic, think 'convention over configuration'</span>
<span>-- where you can have generated sane defaults, or customise if you like</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And personally I think Haskell is quite beautiful to read and write. #notbiased</p>

<h3 id="parsing-libraries">Parsing Libraries</h3>

<p>A lot of the logic of Deadpendency is parsing. Either parsing dependency files or parsing various API responses. Haskell has many excellent parsing libraries, most notably <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>aeson</code></a> for JSON.</p>

<p>Why is this nice in Haskell? The ‘monad’ abstraction is excellent for dealing with code with a lot of failure conditions (ie. parsing) and avoids ‘pyramid of doom’ type code. Haskell worked out really well in this key area.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://alistairb.dev/images/hadouken.jpeg" alt="Pyramid of doom meme"></p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>Another strong positive for writing Deadpendency was testing. Haskell has a lesser-known style of testing libraries that do ‘property based testing’ (PBT).</p>

<p>PBT allows you to write value generators for your data types, which you use to generate 100s or 1000s of test cases. Then, you run these generated values against some function and check that certain properties hold.</p>

<p>For example, part of the Deadpendency logic is generating an HTML report at the end. I had some <code>toHtml :: Report -&gt; HTML</code> function that I wanted to test. So I wrote a <code>fromHtml :: HTML -&gt; Report</code> function where it goes the other way (ok writing that was pretty painful). Then my PBT test will generate 100s of <code>Report</code> values and check that <code>report == fromHtml (toHtml report)</code> (this is known as ‘roundtrip testing’). With this single test I was able to find many edge case bugs with my HTML report generation logic.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9tqj.jpg" alt="Haskell with servant fused-effects is hard meme"></p>

<p>PBT exists in some other languages, but it originated (I believe?) in Haskell so the libraries are excellent.</p>

<h3 id="not-actively-maintained-libraries">Not Actively Maintained Libraries</h3>

<p>A big challenge of working with Haskell was the lack of well-maintained libraries. Ironically, of the 75 (!) packages I depend upon 19 are flagged by Deadpendency as unhealthy (deprecated or inactive). This means I often don’t have the luxury of asking library maintainers to fix bugs. Even if I PR a fix, sometimes that PR will be ignored for months.</p>

<p>This I think is the reality of using a niche language like Haskell. To be clear, I do not think library developers owe me anything, but it is nonetheless a downside when compared to more popular languages.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4x9xjq.jpg" alt="Haskell not actively maintained meme"></p>

<p>Thankfully Haskell build tools have good support for loading a package from git. This means you can PR some bug fix or feature and immediately use your fork to work around the problem.</p>

<h3 id="compile-times-were-fine">Compile Times.. Were Fine</h3>

<p>I thought I’d call this out as it is a common complaint I see around Haskell. I followed some <a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2019/11/27/keeping_compilation_fast.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good advice</a> which kept compilation fast (aside from <a href="https://twitter.com/AlistairBuzz/status/1253507016242294784" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one interesting edge case I resolved</a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Number of modules (Haskell source files) - 509</li>
  <li>Number of lines of Haskell - 20090</li>
  <li>Number of dependencies - 75</li>
  <li>Dell 9570 XPS Laptop - (Hex core - 8th-gen Intel Core i7-8750H CPU), 32GB memory</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the numbers?</p>

<h4 id="compile-dependencies-from-scratch">Compile dependencies from scratch</h4>

<p>Time: 17m44s</p>

<p>This is compiling all application dependencies, which needs to be done before you can compile your application code. Rebuilding all from scratch rarely happens as both my dev machines and CI will cache and only rebuild what has changed.</p>

<p>You do sometimes update a very core package which triggers a lot of dependent packages to recompile which can take a while. Although, I usually do dependency updates at the start of the day while I’m sipping my coffee, so usually don’t notice.</p>

<h4 id="compile-app-including-tests-in-development">Compile app (including tests) in development</h4>

<p>Time: 1m1s</p>

<p>Likewise, due to caching a full recompilation rarely happens. As such, most code edits do not trigger many modules to be recompiled and it is fast.</p>

<p>Additionally, Haskell has nice ‘continuous compilation’ tools that fire on save. Usually by the time I actually look at my terminal compilation is already done.</p>

<h4 id="compile-app-for-deployment">Compile app for deployment</h4>

<p>with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/using-optimisation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full optimisations</a> (-02).</p>

<p>Time: 2m53s</p>

<p>This typically runs in CI. It runs in parallel with a host of other checks such as running my tests, which also take a few minutes. Due to this, the time doesn’t really impact the build + deploy time too much.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4xp4zu.jpg" alt="Compile times meme"></p>

<h3 id="refactoring-pain">Refactoring Pain</h3>

<p>Deadpendency is relatively simple in what it does, but there is a lot of hidden complexity to the problem. Which is to say, it is like 99% of applications 😉. When developing it I was constantly realising I had modelled things a bit too simplistically and would need to refactor.</p>

<p>Haskell is very safe to refactor thanks to the type safety the compiler brings, which is probably the most important thing. However, Haskell does not have great tools to help with refactoring, at least in terms of the restructuring changes I kept making. The <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apply-refact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/retrie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools</a> seem more geared towards complex rewriting of common code, not restructuring modules or renaming identifiers.</p>

<p>As such I did it all manually with text search replace, or just change something and fix all the new compiler errors. This was a bit of a grind and it caused me to delay needed refactoring sometimes.</p>

<p>It’s a pity Haskell doesn’t have the refactoring tools to help in this situation. The dream would be these tools integrated into an IDE.</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://i.redd.it/dbdshzzflgd31.jpg" alt="Haskell had an IDE meme"></p>

<p>(Stolen from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/cjtbfj/society_if_haskell_has_ide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reddit</a>)</p>

<p>Having said that, it should be noted that Haskell does have an excellent IDE now in the form of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell Language Server</a> (HLS). The momentum around the project is insane and I applaud the developers. One fixed pain point from HLS is it does auto imports now, which used to greatly contribute to the friction of working with Haskell. I’m sure Haskell will get there eventually.</p>

<h3 id="waiting-for-new-ghc-versions-to-be-usable">Waiting for New GHC Versions to be Usable</h3>

<p>This is mostly me complaining for the sake of it, but as someone pretty obsessed with both new shiny versions of things and Haskell, waiting for new GHC (GHC is the Haskell compiler) versions to be usable has been painful. There is a long tail of libraries and platforms that need to be updated before I can use a new GHC version. Sometimes these updates can drag a lot.</p>

<p>For example GHC 9 was just released, but I still haven’t been able to upgrade to GHC 8.10 yet which was first released in March 2020.</p>

<p><img width="500" src="https://i.imgflip.com/4xebid.jpg" alt="GHC releases meme"></p>

<h2 id="launching">Launching</h2>

<p>So after about 8 months of work I was ready to start getting users. I slowly soft launched, promoting it in a few small channels. How did my Haskell fair in prod?</p>

<h3 id="very-few-logic-bugs">Very Few Logic Bugs</h3>

<p>My core Haskell had very few logic bugs. This is because Haskell is very safe by default and I had opted into strict types that help catch edge cases.</p>

<p>For example, I was using a lot of <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Data-List-NonEmpty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>NonEmpty</code></a> lists which the compiler will guarantee is not empty. To use them you must specify how to handle the empty case. ie. what do I do if Deadpendency can’t find any dependencies to check?</p>

<p>And of course, I had …</p></div></div>

______________________________________________________________________

RETRO is a clean, elegant, and pragmatic dialect of Forth. It provides
a simple alternative for those willing to make a break from legacy
systems.

The language draws influences from many sources including traditional 
Forth systems, cmForth, colorForth, Factor, and Parable. It was
designed to be easy to grasp and adapt to specific uses.

The basic language is very portable. It runs on a tiny virtual
machine (Nga), which is written in C. There are multiple interface
options, the main one (rre) is buildable with just the standard C
compiler and libraries on most systems.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">

				
				<p><strong>The European Patent Office considered an SQL language extension for modifying collection-valued and scalar valued columns in a single statement to be technical</strong><b>. </b><strong>Here are the practical takeaways of the decision&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t170697eu1.html">T 0697/17 (SQL extensions/MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING)</a> of 17.10.2019 of Technical Board of Appeal 3.5.07:</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2>

            <p>The terms “relational database system”, “parser”, “query optimizer” and “query execution engine” have well-known meanings in the field of database management systems.</p>

            

            <p>Describing a technical feature at a high level of abstraction does not necessarily take away the feature’s technical character. Such a feature does not lose its technical nature just because it is too generic or functionally defined.</p>

            

            <p>In order to decide whether a performance improvement of a computer program is a technical effect it has to be further determined how the improvement is achieved, for instance whether it is the result of technical considerations regarding the functioning of the technical context of the invention (e.g. computer, system, process, transmission channel).</p>

            

            <p>Features make a technical contribution if they result from technical considerations on how to, for instance, improve processing speed, reduce the amount of memory required, improve availability or scalability, or reduce network traffic, when compared with the prior art or once added to the other features of the invention, and contribute in combination with technical features to achieve such an effect.</p>

            

            <p>A change in the quality of a program in terms of the user preferences or other subjective criteria in principle do not give indications of a technical contribution.</p>

            

            <p>A possible test for determining whether non-technical features are based on technical considerations is to consider whether the non-technical features would have been formulated by a technical or by a non-technical expert.</p>

            

            <p>While a database system is used to store non-technical information and database design usually involves information-modelling aspects which do not contribute to solving a technical problem, the implementation of a database management system involves technical considerations. Therefore, a database management system is not a computer program as such but rather a technical system.</p>

            
<h2>The invention</h2>
<p>This European patent application relates to a relational database system and a corresponding method for updating values in a complex-structured-type column. According to the description, the purpose of the invention is to achieve complex and partial updates efficiently.</p>
<p>A complex structured type consists of a set of fields, properties and methods, wherein each field or property can be a scalar type, a complex structured type itself, or a multiset in which each element is a complex structured type. The database system of the invention uses a nested extension of the SQL UPDATE statement which supports the modification of collection-valued columns using syntax and semantics analogous to those of the conventional UPDATE statement. The system includes a parser that parses a database modification (query) statement and produces a logical description of changes to the table as specified by the UPDATE statement, a query optimizer that produces the execution algorithm that will perform the modifications, and finally a query execution engine that implements the execution algorithm.</p>
<p>In order to modify collection-valued columns, the execution algorithm uses a data structure named “change descriptor”. The change descriptor represents an aggregation of changes to the values in the collection-valued column and the location of the values to be updated in the hierarchy of the complex structured type column. It aggregates all changes, both scalar and collection-valued, into a single value. The query execution engine reads the change descriptor and applies the changes as described by it to the collection-valued columns in addition to using simple scalar updates for the scalar valued columns.</p>
<p>The change descriptor was said to enable the efficient application of multiple updates at various granularity levels in a single operation, enable the implementation of efficient index maintenance algorithms and have the benefit of separating the computation of the changes from their application itself (known as Halloween Protection).</p>

<p>Here is how the invention is defined in claim 1 (main request):</p>

            

            
<h2>Is it technical?</h2>
<p>Concerning the <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/europeansoftwarepatents/software-patent-epo/">first hurdle of patentability (patent-eligibility)</a>, the first instance examining division had taken the view that claim 1 in its entirety described a purely abstract method. The division held that the wording of the claim did not describe the method as one that was “technically realised (e.g. computer implemented)”, nor did it mention any “technical entities (e.g. a computer, a processor, etc.)”.</p>
<p>The board of appeal did not agree to this assessment and gave an interesting recapitulation of the legal requirements of the exclusion from patentability, citing various earlier decisions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Claim 1 of the main request defines a method of “updating values in a complex structured type column having a hierarchical structure in a relational database system”. <strong>The terms “relational database system”, “parser”, “query optimizer” and “query execution engine” used in the claim have well-known meanings in the field of database management systems.</strong></p>
<p>According to the established case law, a claim directed to a computer-implemented invention <strong>avoids exclusion merely by explicitly mentioning the use of a computer, a computer-readable storage medium or other technical means</strong>. A claim specifying e.g. a computer-implemented method, a computer-readable storage medium or a program on a computer-readable storage medium is therefore not to be considered excluded from patentability under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC (see e.g. opinion G 3/08, OJ EPO 2011, 10, reasons 10.6, 10.8.5, 10.8.6 and 10.13; <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/europeansoftwarepatents/knowledgebase/methods-which-use-technical-means-are-patent-eligible/">T 258/03</a>, OJ EPO 2004, 575, reasons 4; Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, 8th edition 2016, I.A.1.4.3 and 2.4.3, e), Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-II, 3.3 and 3.6).</p>
<p>In decision T 388/04 (OJ EPO 2007, 16), subject-matter or activities that are excluded from patentability under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC were considered “to remain so even where they impl[ied] the possibility of making use of unspecified technical means” (reasons 3). But that is not the case where the claimed subject-matter does not only merely “imply the possibility of making use of unspecified technical means” but in fact clearly implies the use of concrete technical means. For example, in decision T 650/13 of 2 October 2018 the board considered that the method of claim 1 was not excluded because “transmitting the symbol in a code word to a decoder” implied the use of technical means (reasons 6.1).</p>
<p>In the decision under appeal, the Examining Division argued that claim 1 merely enumerated a number of logical entities, for example a “relational database system” and a “parser”, fulfilling a certain logical functionality.</p>
<p>The Board finds the Examining Division’s assessment to be incorrect. Claim 1 defines a “method of updating values in a complex structured type column … in a relational database system” including steps performed by modules of a database system. <strong>Claim 1 therefore defines a method performed in a relational database system.</strong> In principle, the terms used in a claim should be given the common meaning they have in the relevant technical field. <strong>In computer science, the term “relational database system” relates to a software system implemented in one or more computers for storing, controlling and processing data.</strong> Carrying out a method performed in a relational database system involves the use of a computer system. <strong>Therefore, the claimed method cannot be seen as a purely abstract method, as argued by the Examining Division, but as a method which uses technical means.</strong></p>
<p>In this context, the Board notes that <strong>describing a technical feature at a high level of abstraction does not necessarily take away the feature’s technical character</strong>. As explained in opinion G 3/08, reasons 10.8.5, 10.8.7 and 10.13, the feature “computer-readable storage medium” has the technical effects of being computer-readable and of storing data, even if a more concrete technical implementation is not specified. <strong>Such a feature does not lose its technical nature just because it is too generic or “functionally defined”</strong> (G 3/08, reasons 10.8.7), or commonly known (see <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/europeansoftwarepatents/knowledgebase/methods-which-use-technical-means-are-patent-eligible/">T 258/03</a>, reasons 4.3).</p>
<p>Finally, the Board notes that there are <strong>several examples in the case law in which features of a database system have been considered as technical aspects when assessing inventive step</strong> (see e.g. T 1242/04, OJ EPO 2007, 421, reasons 3.2 and 4.3; T 1025/08 of 19 April 2013, reasons 2.12; T 1500/08 of 4 November 2011, reasons 5.9 and 5.10; T 1414/10 of 23 March 2015, reasons 4.9 and 4.10; and T 1924/17 of 29 July 2019, reasons 9 and 11 to 11.8).</p></blockquote>
<p>The board therefore disagreed with the examining division’s assessment and had no doubt that claim 1 must be considered an invention in a field of technology within the meaning of Article 52(2) and (3) EPC.</p>
<p>Then, the board moved on with the assessment of inventive step, again giving a helpful summary of the <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/europeansoftwarepatents/software-patent-epo/">legal framework concerning mixed-type inventions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Inventive step can be based only on features that contribute to the solution of a technical problem bringing about a technical effect</strong> (<a href="https://www.bardehle.com/europeansoftwarepatents/knowledgebase/only-technical-features-can-establish-an-inventive-step/">T 641/00</a>, OJ EPO 2003, 352, reasons 4 to 6). Features which are non-technical when taken in isolation but which interact with technical features of the invention to solve such a technical problem should be taken into account in assessing inventive step (see e.g. T 208/84, OJ EPO 1987, 14, reasons 4 et seq.; T 154/04, OJ …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>If you were given 1 TB of data and asked to sort it using 1000 computers, how would you do it. This is a Google senior interview question, and below is a summary of the optimum solution. In this article, we will do the full 2-hour interview stages together and get hired!</p>

<video width="1920" height="1080" controls=""><source src="https://quanticdev.com/algorithms/distributed-computing/media/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>First off, let’s check out the agenda for this writeup. We will start by visualizing the problem. Then we will continue with a concise design document. This is probably going to be on a whiteboard in a real interview, so we will keep it short. In the document, we will define the problem, do requirements analysis, do system design using a simple diagram, and finally do the complexity analysis. Then we will actually code and implement this system. Then we’ll add some tests. And we will close it off with a discussion with the interviewers.</p>

<p>I will take you through the entire 2-hour interview in sections and do every section with an in-depth analysis. You are about to read the most in-depth late-stage senior interview analysis on the internet. So, sit back, relax, and turn up your brain to the max.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Let’s check out the problem in hand. In this question, you are given 1 TB of data sitting in a database, and 1000 computers each with 1.5 GB of RAM. And you are asked to sort this data as fast as possible.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/algorithms/distributed-computing/distributed-sorting/media/distributed_sort_problem_definition.png" alt="Distributed Sorting Interview Question by Google"></p>

<p>This is a distributed sorting question asked by Google in a senior engineer interview. This was asked during the final interview round, and it is a hard question. In addition to the question being hard, the discussion held with the interviewer around other possible solutions, possible improvements, and external factors that might affect the performance, will test your deeper understanding of the topic. The source of this question is Hacker News, and you can find several versions of this question being discussed by ex-Googlers on HN. Obviously, I cannot reveal the source directly, but I am keeping a record of these questions as I find them to see how frequently they are asked. Distributed computing questions seem very frequent at senior Google interviews. On a side note, the original question was asked to be implemented using Python or C++ on a Kubernetes cluster. Finally, 2 hours is allocated for this interview, including design, implementation, and discussion. We will look into multiple approaches to solve this problem and investigate different requirements along with other variants that you might be given in an interview situation.</p>

<h2 id="problem-visualization">Problem Visualization</h2>
<p>Let’s start by visualizing the problem. When I am given a question, the first thing I do is to try to visualize it in my mind to investigate possible solutions quickly. I do this before jumping into the requirements analysis and start asking questions. If I am given a whiteboard, I will try to visualize the problem drawing a matrix, a diagram, or whatever might help me imagine possible solutions.</p>

<p>For this article, I will visualize this question using an animated diagram to help you understand it better. We start with our 1 TB of data in our database. Then comes our 1000 computers with 1.5 GB of RAM each. Let’s say we make each computer read 1 GB portion of our data from our database. Now we are left with 1000 nodes with all our data in them.</p>

<p>Next, what do we do with this much data and this many nodes? How do we utilize the CPU power of all the nodes at the same time? We can try to make all nodes sort the data that they have in them. Remember, they all have 1.5 GB of RAM, and we have only used 1 GB of it. This gives us 500 MB of auxiliary space to work with. Heapsort only requires O(1) auxiliary space, so it is perfect for this job. Quicksort also only requires O(logn) auxiliary space, so we might use that too. We can decide this in the design phase.</p>

<p>Once each node finishes sorting their data simultaneously, how do we merge them? Well, there is a method called k-way merge designed exactly for this purpose. We can definitely use that! It is possible to implement k-way (also known as multiway) merge using a heap, or even better, using tournament trees. We start by selecting one of the nodes as the leader, the leader pulls the first values from each other node and puts them in a tournament tree. The root of the tree will be our first winner and the very first sorted value. Then we pull a new value in place of the missing value, complete our tournament tree and get the root again. We can keep doing this to get a sorted stream of data and write it back to our database into another table. This seems like a very workable approach. But will it match the requirements? We will have to discover that by asking lots of questions to the interviewers. But this is a good visualization and good initial approach which should hopefully help us come up with lots of good questions in the requirements analysis phase.</p>

<h2 id="design-document">Design Document</h2>
<p>In a regular coding interview, I would directly jump to the requirements analysis to select the best algorithm for the question in hand. However, this is the final interview stage with 2 hours to go. This is where you show off with your software engineering skills. So, we treat this as a serious project and start with a design document. Typically, design documents are very long and detailed. A well-crafted design increases the odds of success of a project. However, for this occasion, we will keep it short. Short enough to fit into a single whiteboard, or a single page if you are given paper. If you want to see a complete example, I have the link to Chromium Project’s Design Document Template in the resources section above.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/algorithms/distributed-computing/distributed-sorting/media/chromium_design_document_template.png" alt="Chromium Project Design Document Template"></p>

<h3 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h3>
<p>The very first section of each design document is the problem definition. The problem in hand is distributed sorting (also known as external sorting) of a very large dataset with memory-constrained nodes.</p>

<h3 id="requirements-analysis">Requirements Analysis</h3>
<p>This is probably the most crucial part of the entire interview. This is where your future will be decided. If you ask the right questions in this section and proceed to implementation in full agreement with the interviewers, you will have a great chance of passing the interview. The question that we are given is very generic and is lacking many important details. It is clear to me that the interviewer expects us to ask for clarifications, so we will do that soon. I would argue that a software engineering’s prime function is gathering requirements, so it is common for interviewers to ask vague questions to test your investigative skills. This part also reveals your depth of understanding of the topic. Let’s start with some important questions to the interviewer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Question: Is there any order, pattern, or uniform distribution in the initial data.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: No.</li>
      <li>Comment: This means that we cannot take a shortcut by using specialized sorting techniques like bucket sort. If the given data had uniform distribution, we could simply partition it to all nodes and use bucket sort.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question: What shall I do with the final sorted data?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: We will stream it to somewhere else for further processing.</li>
      <li>Comment: This is typical for data processing pipelines. We start with a set of nodes optimized for sorting and merging the data. Then we send the data to other nodes which are hardware optimized for other forms of processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question: What is the read speed of the database?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: Let’s say 20 GB/s.</li>
      <li>Comment: This happens a lot in interviews. This means that the interviewer does not have a specific number in mind but wants you to assume that you should not be concerned with the database performance and assume that it is sufficient.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question: Will we separately store the sorted data in the database?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: No.</li>
      <li>Comment: Interviewer already said that we were going to send the final sorted data somewhere else. This question was just to be extra sure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question: What is the network latency between each computer node?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: Let’s say not too bad.</li>
      <li>Comment: This means that you should not be concerned with the latency between the nodes. Maybe interviewers did not think of a scenario where you would want to use a distributed partitioning algorithm which would require a fast network.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question: Can we use all of 1.5 GB of memory in each node?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: Yes.</li>
      <li>Comment: Again, this is good. When we have only 1 GB of data in each node, we can choose a sorting or partitioning algorithm that requires up to n/2 auxiliary space.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question: Do the computer nodes have disks or other persistent storage that we can write to?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Their Answer: No.</li>
      <li>Comment: This is expected. Involving persistent storage in our data processing would introduce yet another point of failure, so not so desirable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is enough questions for now. We clarified the task in hand quite …</p></section></div></div>

<p>Everyone’s had a bad boss.</p>



<p>And then there are the bosses that aren’t necessarily <em>bad</em>, but who are overworked, overextended, disorganized, or just straight up disengaged with their work. Those bosses are a dime a dozen.</p>



<p>Dealing with bad bosses is something that we all have to learn, regardless of the industry we work in. The same goes for dealing with mediocre bosses, and even dealing with good bosses who, for whatever reason, aren’t doing the best job at being bosses. One secret? It’s something called “managing up,” and it’s gotten a lot of attention in business circles in recent years.</p>



<p>Managing up isn’t just for the corporate world, though. Developers can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/ccoyud/managing_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>make use of this tactic</u></a>&nbsp;to better deal with their managers, too. Read on to learn all you need to know.</p>



<h2>What Is Managing Up?</h2>



<p>A lot of different experts and publications define managing up in different ways. But at the core of what they all say it means, managing up is doing everything you can to make your boss’s job easier —&nbsp;basically, it’s managing your manager.</p>



<p>The <em>Harvard Business Review</em>&nbsp;has <a href="https://hbr.org/topic/managing-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>written a lot about managing up</u></a>&nbsp;in recent years, and says that doing so effectively takes a combination of these five steps:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1378" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-scaled.jpg" alt="What Is Managing Up?" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-1536x827.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01-Image-3-2048x1103.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<ul><li>Communicating your priorities to your manager, and seeking their feedback;</li><li>Being able to anticipate your manager’s needs;</li><li>Understanding what makes your manager tick;</li><li>Knowing the right way to approach your manager to discuss problems; and</li><li>Learning how to be a well-rounded employee who can help out in a variety of different roles.</li></ul>



<h3>Why Would Anyone Want To Manage Up?</h3>



<p>We know how this sounds: Like it’s a <em>lot</em>&nbsp;of work. In fact, one of the most prominent criticisms of managing up is that it asks lower level employees to essentially do their boss’s job —&nbsp;without getting their boss’s pay.</p>



<p>But managing up gives workers more control over their work environment and conditions. It allows them an active voice in setting expectations at work, and establishing norms for the workplace. For developers specifically, managing up can be an effective way to protect your autonomy at work, and minimize conflict with your boss, other members of your team, and anyone else at work.</p>



<p>And while managing up is a great tool for dealing with a less-than-stellar boss, these tactics offer other benefits, too. Regardless of the quality of your boss, managing up establishes you to be capable, efficient, and a self-starter —&nbsp;someone who can be trusted to manage their work without any hand-holding or micro-managing, and someone who will likely be able to rise in the ranks of their organization quickly.</p>



<h2>How Can Developers Manage Up?</h2>



<p>Managing up is a little bit different for software developers.</p>



<p>Why? Modern software teams have to work together in a fast-paced, highly collaborative, experimental, and iterative environment. In order for teams to succeed across the organization, everyone involved in any given software project needs to be good at communication, collaboration, coordination, planning, and prioritization.</p>



<p>In other words? Everyone —&nbsp;not just managers —&nbsp;needs to have “management skills.”</p>



<p>That means that members of software teams aren’t as able to just show up and do their jobs as workers in some other industries. Because developers are required to have these skills, it’s common for more of the management load to shift as everyone on the team becomes deputized to help out —&nbsp;particularly in cases where managers are overworked or overextended.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t preclude developers from consciously managing up to make their own lives easier, or to advance their careers. Here’s how to get started, one step at a time.</p>



<h3>Your First Managing Up Experiment: Step By Step</h3>



<p>For a developer who hasn’t tried managing up before, it can be intimidating to figure out how to get started. Here are some easy steps to follow to get the hang of managing up. Once you’ve gone through these steps a few times, you should be able to manage your manager effectively on the day-to-day, and on large projects.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2220" height="2560" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-scaled.jpg" alt="Your First Managing Up Experiment: Step By Step" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-scaled.jpg 2220w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-888x1024.jpg 888w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-768x886.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-1332x1536.jpg 1332w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-2-1776x2048.jpg 1776w" sizes="(max-width: 2220px) 100vw, 2220px"></figure>



<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Try to pick a skill area that requires little to no investment. When you’re first learning how to manage up, it’s a good idea to do so in an area where you’re already skilled and comfortable. It gives you better odds of knocking your experiment out of the park.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Baseline the current state well before you start making changes. A key to being successful at managing up is to show that your autonomous work is of good quality and improves the team’s work or moves the team forward. So before you start, make sure you document the baseline you’re working with so you’ll be able to show improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Based on the current metrics and perception, create a plan that will improve KPIs. This is where the baseline you established will come in handy. Figure out how to improve beyond that baseline, and then take your plan to your boss to show them how you can make the desired improvements.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Execute the plan with your boss’s blessing. Managing up isn’t about going behind your boss’s back. It’s about presenting your plan to improve metrics in such a way that even your boss will see how this makes your life, their life, and the lives of everyone on the team easier. You want them to have no choice but to give you their blessing.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Measure for success. Track whatever KPIs are important and compare them against the baseline you established in Step 2 so you can clearly show improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Move on to another item to build more trust. Once you’ve shown you can improve one area of your or your team’s work, choose another to focus on. This shows your boss that you can replicate your autonomous success.</p>



<p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Run this for at least 3 cycles before you ask your manager for anything big. As you establish yourself as someone who can deliver on your promises and make improvements at work, you’ll eventually build the trust needed to take on bigger and bigger projects —&nbsp;and more and more control over your work environment.</p>



<h2>Best Practices for Managing Up</h2>



<p>Like any other skill, though, managing up is easier said than done. These are some of the best practices that will help you succeed at managing your manager.</p>



<h3>Dos and Don’ts</h3>



<p>Let’s start with the things you <strong>should and should not do</strong>&nbsp;when managing up.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1025" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-scaled.jpg" alt="Best Practices for Managing Up" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-300x120.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-1024x410.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-768x307.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-1536x615.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/03-Image-2-2048x820.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p><strong>Do:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>Be curious. Get to know your role, your boss, and your boss’s role. Ask a lot of questions. Show an interest in everything about your work and your company.</li><li>Anticipate needs. As you get to know your boss and their job better, you might be able to deliver on what they need before they even ask you for it.</li><li>Jump in. Always be willing to help out wherever and whenever you can.</li><li>Think about the big picture. Try to see beyond your role, and what the goals and direction are for your entire organization. Then, align your own goals and priorities with the bigger picture.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Don’t:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>Manipulate. There’s a very big difference between managing up and sucking up, brown-nosing, or being a yes man. You want to be seen as positive, helpful, and self-starting, not as someone who sucks up to their boss to win favor.</li><li>Get involved in politics. Just about any time a group of people works together, there’s bound to be office politics. Avoid getting involved in them by not talking about other people, but instead focusing on doing your job well and delivering quality and results.</li><li>Cover up your mistakes. As you take on new projects and strive to lead and work autonomously, you’re bound to make mistakes. Own up to them when they happen, and be reflective about how you can learn from them to get better and avoid making similar mistakes in the future. That’s the mark of a real leader.</li></ul>



<h2>Getting Better At Managing Up</h2>



<p>Like any workplace skill, getting better at managing up takes work and practice. Here are some ways to continue to improve at managing your manager.</p>



<h3>Come With Solutions, Not Just Problems</h3>



<p>When you run into problems at work, yes you should present those to your boss. But when you come to your manager with a problem, try to also bring a potential solution or two. It shows initiative and mastery.</p>



<h3>Take Small Things Off Your Boss’s Plate</h3>



<p>Managing up doesn’t have to be all about big, grand projects that propel your entire organization forward. It can be as simple as looking for small things you can volunteer to handle for your boss so they’re off their plate. Look for tasks like scheduling meetings, booking meeting rooms, doing basic research, and other administrative tasks that can save a lot of time for your boss.</p>



<h3>Adjust Your Work Style to Fit Your Boss’s Needs</h3>



<p>One of the best tips for successfully managing up is to adjust your work and communication styles to fit what your boss prefers. For example, if they prefer emails over face-to-face meetings, try to shoot off messages to them throughout the day rather than stopping by their office with questions and updates.</p>



<h3>Lead New Changes That Meet Big Picture Goals</h3>



<p>Look for ways to change your workplace processes or innovate, and when you present those to your boss, volunteer to lead the work that it will take to implement those changes. This shows a few things: That you’re aware of and thinking about the big-picture goals of your organization, and that you’re willing to put in the work it takes to move toward those goals.</p>



<p>Learning how to manage up will take time and work — this is definitely a long-term strategy for gaining autonomy and control over your work environment.</p>



<p>But that work will pay off when you’re a trusted part of your organization, known for being able to tackle any problem without being micromanaged. Give your boss better things to do than breathe down your neck —&nbsp;start managing up today.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month, the owners of a Dublin wealth management firm got a rather unpleasant surprise. On an otherwise uneventful Monday afternoon, they got a call from an irate customer enquiring about an invoice which he had received. The invoice pertained to a management fee supplement incurred because of Brexit. The amount was €2,220.58. Shortly afterwards, another customer made a similar enquiry about an invoice which they had also received pertaining to a management fee supplement. By the end of the day, over a dozen customers had contacted them about this supplemental charge. The only problem was, this wealth management firm had implemented no supplemental charge. The invoices these customers had received were fakes.</p><p>

<strong>That Sinking Feeling…</strong></p><p>

It was now dawning on the firm’s management team that one of their Office 365 emails accounts must have been compromised (hacked). They called their managed service provider who examined the fraudulent emails. It seemed the invoices had emanated from the email account of just one user. When they logged in remotely to the user’s account, they discovered that some of their Outlook email rules had been changed. This meant that some of their inbound emails (those contacts stored in the user’s address book) were being redirected to the hacker instead. This was a clear case of business email compromise, also known as invoice fraud.</p><p>

<strong>The Power of a Cloned Invoice</strong></p><p>

The invoice (which one of their customers had forwarded them) was a carbon copy clone of the standard type of invoice they usually sent out. The logo was the same and the typeface copied to perfection. The only difference was the bank account details had been changed. On further investigation, they discovered that this invoice was sent out to over 150 of their clients.</p><p>

<strong>Repercussions of the Attack</strong></p><p>

Some clients had paid this fraudulent invoice. It was, after all, sent by a person they trusted and sent from a trusted email account. They were now demanding reimbursement after discovering it was a fake. Some were also threatening legal action if the monies paid to the scammers were not reimbursed.</p><p>

In the days following the attack, the firm was deluged with more emails and phone calls from concerned clients. They wanted to know if other financial information of theirs had been compromised.</p><p>

Unfortunately, some of the clients demanded the return of all their financial files and decided to terminate all business transactions with the firm. Needless to say, this was an extremely distressing event for everyone involved.</p><p>

<strong>Beware False Assumptions about IT Security </strong></p><p>

The management of this firm believed that anti-malware software installed on their employees’ systems would detect any threats. But while hardware and software security controls can detect a lot of threats, they cannot detect all threats. The management also believed that the anti-spam filter of Office 365 would detect any fraudulent emails. However, social engineering attacks are designed so that the user installs data-stealing software themselves or divulges their email credentials of their own volition.</p><p>

The management team and their MSP suspected that the employee had either fallen for a phishing scam or had malware installed on their device that stole their Outlook 365 credentials. Either way, a hacker was able to exploit one of their trusted email accounts and hijack one of their contact lists, resulting in financial loss and severe reputational damage.</p><p>

<strong>Enabled Two-Factor Authentication is Useless </strong></p><p>

Their MSP had set up two-factor authentication (2FA) on their Office 365 platform but this was not enforced two-factor authentication, it was enabled instead. The distinction between “enabled” and “enforced” two-factor authentication is crucial. The former means it is optional for the user whereas the latter means it is obligatory.</p><p>

The hacker was able to change the email rules in Outlook so that the emails would get redirected to him. Every user in this firm had global admin rights. This was a big mistake because, in the case of compromise, too many admin rights will give the miscreant way too much latitude.</p><p>

The user who got compromised was using a very weak password which was basically a concatenation of the names of their two children. This password did not have enough entropy to make it secure, making it vulnerable to brute-forcing attacks.</p><p>


<strong>The most effective way to prevent such an invoice redirection fraud from happening to your organisation</strong></p><p>

Perhaps one of the most effective ways of preventing social-engineering attacks, such as invoice fraud, is by training your employees how to detect and mitigate such attacks. Effective IT security awareness training trains your users to detect and mitigate attacks which can’t be detected by your security software or company firewall. They are shown real-life examples of current threats in circulation that are deconstructed to make them fully aware of the tactics used by hackers which can blindside even the most technically sophisticated users. Effective training conditions your workforce to think like a hacker and makes them aware of the security implications of everyday IT tasks in a totally different way. A collective change in IT security behaviours amongst your staff will result in a greatly enhanced security posture. This results in:</p></div><p>
And of course, it helps you sleep a little sounder at night.</p></div>]]>

                        <p>Previously, I detailed why India should <a href="https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/">buy Bitcoin</a>. Here we'll discuss why India cannot actually ban Bitcoin, and should instead treat crypto as a foreign currency using its existing foreign exchange regime (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Exchange_Management_Act">FEMA</a>). Our argument proceeds in four parts:</p><ol><li><a href="#s1">Why India can't truly ban crypto</a></li><li><a href="#s2">What people think a crypto "ban" <em>could </em>do</a></li><li><a href="#s3">What a crypto "ban" actually <em>would</em> do</a></li><li><a href="#s4">And what India <em>should</em> do: legalize crypto under FEMA</a></li></ol><p>In short, crypto cannot truly be banned for technical, social, and political reasons. The proponents of a ban think it could help Indian national security, but would find that a crypto ban simply shuts down well-lit, regulated exchanges in favor of underground crypto, and causes trillions in collateral damage to boot. Bad actors would not obey a ban, people with the means to do so would move themselves or their money abroad, and hundreds of millions of ordinary Indians would suffer compounding economic losses for every year they are firewalled from this new <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1361285040286560256">financial internet</a>.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Countries don’t ban bitcoin. They only ban themselves from the bitcoin network</p>— unfettered nic carter (@nic__carter) <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1362062603435077632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The decision is important and the Indian public does not yet appreciate the stakes. If the country legalizes crypto, the positive impact may amount to trillions in both asset appreciation and GDP growth over the 2020s, because crypto is already worth &gt;$1T and growing fast. Conversely, a "ban" would cost India trillions over the long term as the financial internet grows outside the country.</p><p>Instead of a "ban", India should legalize crypto, take advantage of its remittance-friendly properties, and resolve potential misuse by extending the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) to treat cryptocurrencies as foreign assets. Because a ban would revert India to the failed pre-liberalization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Exchange_Management_Act#Switch_from_FERA">FERA era</a>, when foreign assets were suspect and trade was inhibited.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Let's now go into more detail, starting with why we put the term "ban" in quotes.</p><h2 id="why-india-can-t-ban-crypto">Why India can't "ban" crypto</h2><p>India can't ban crypto for three reasons.</p><ol><li>It's not technically feasible: math and computer science get in the way.</li><li>It's not socially feasible: brilliant engineers, billionaire financiers, and tens of millions of crypto holders globally present formidable obstacles.</li><li>It's not politically feasible: other states will be launching their own national digital currencies, and India will not be able to prevent them from doing so nor stop them from internationalizing their offerings.</li></ol><h3 id="banning-crypto-is-not-technically-feasible">Banning crypto is not technically feasible</h3><p>To understand why banning Bitcoin is not technically feasible, let's start with something you probably understand: Gmail. You log into Gmail with your address (like <code>yourname@gmail.com</code>) and a password (like <code>lkajsd834908</code>). Anyone can send email to that address, but only you – with the password – can send email from that address.</p><p>Bitcoin is similar. You have an address (like <code>3FZbgi29cpjq2GjdwV8eyHuJJnkLtktZc5</code>) and a <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/seed-phrase">passphrase</a> (like <code>forget wing follow flip swallow achieve correct view dinner witness hybrid proud</code>). Anyone can send units of Bitcoin (BTC) to your address, but only you – with the passphrase – can send BTC from that address.</p><p>There is one big difference, though. With Gmail, if you forget your password, Google can reset it. With Bitcoin, if you forget your passphrase, <em>no one</em> can reset it. The downside of this is that you can lose your Bitcoin entirely. The upside is that <em>no one</em> else (including Google) has access to your passphrase, and that means no one else can move your BTC.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/demonocracy-gold-10_tons-100_tons.jpg" width="980" height="770" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/demonocracy-gold-10_tons-100_tons.jpg 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/demonocracy-gold-10_tons-100_tons.jpg 980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/bitcoin-mnemonic-example.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/bitcoin-mnemonic-example.jpg 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/bitcoin-mnemonic-example.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>On the left, <a href="https://demonocracy.info/infographics/world/gold/gold.html">$500M-5B</a> in gold. On the right, a 12-word <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase#Mnemonic_Example">mnemonic</a> that could hold the equivalent in BTC.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you realize that Bitcoin passphrases are literally just a few words that can represent <em>any</em> amount of BTC, you realize how hard it is to actually ban Bitcoin in the sense of seizing BTC from individuals. Each person's holdings can be stored on a tiny text file that no hard drive search will be able to pick up. Transporting a few words across borders is trivial. The words can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">hidden in images</a>, and they can be stored offline. And storing a few words for years does not require persistent internet connectivity or even power. You can literally store billions of dollars of BTC on a scrap of paper.</p><p>That's BTC held by individuals. What about the global Bitcoin network as a whole, the network of computers that facilitates transfers of BTC <em>between</em> people? That's tough to attack too. The Bitcoin blockchain is replicated on millions of computers worldwide, and <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/crypto/cryptography-blockchain/#How_can_blockchains_prevent_double-spending">cryptographically</a> shielded against any attempt to create new currency, rewrite transaction history, or change account balances. Bitcoin mining and nodes are distributed across many geographic regions, and are situated mostly outside India.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.28-AM.png" width="2000" height="1005" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.28-AM.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.28-AM.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.28-AM.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.28-AM.png 2324w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.17-AM.png" width="2000" height="1146" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.17-AM.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.17-AM.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.17-AM.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-13-at-6.29.17-AM.png 2234w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: <a href="https://bitnodes.io/">9514 nodes</a> relay Bitcoin transactions. Right: international <a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map">distribution</a> of Bitcoin mining.</figcaption></figure><p>And that's just Bitcoin. There are other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum. And even if one of these cryptocurrencies fails, it's unlikely they all fail <em>in the same way</em>, because they use different kinds of algorithms. For example, to compromise a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof-of-work</a> currency one might try capturing the physical mining farms located in different countries. But to compromise a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof-of-stake</a> currency you'd need to capture a critical mass of often-pseudonymous individuals around the world.</p><p>Moreover, we haven't even gotten to all the new technologies that have been deployed over the last few years like decentralized exchanges, privacy coins, and cross-chain interoperability. All of these make cryptocurrencies as a class (beyond just Bitcoin) harder to seize or shut down.</p><p>To summarize: Bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrencies more generally were built to resist bans. For the government to truly stop Indians from making Bitcoin transactions a mere internet shutdown for a day or week or even a year would not be enough. The experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation">demonetization</a> is also not applicable, because the issuer of Bitcoin is not the Indian government, and a fiat decree will not reduce the value of BTC to zero.</p><p>To really prevent Indians from holding BTC or sending BTC transactions, the state would need to (a) subject the country to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse">electromagnetic pulse</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degaussing#Magnetic_data_storage_media">mass degaussing</a> sufficient to destroy all forms of memory storage, (b) ban all immigration and emigration indefinitely, and (c) stop all forms of communication entirely with people outside the country (including physical mail) to prevent anyone from sending a few words out of India.</p><p>Clearly this is infeasible, which is why a Bitcoin ban is technically infeasible.</p><p>From a social perspective, Bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrency more generally now boasts ~100M users and enjoys broad support among the world's tech and financial elite. We're talking about billionaires, CEOs, cryptographers, engineers, founders, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and angel investors. Along with an increasing number of human rights activists, athletes, celebrities, and influencers.</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-8.04.01-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-8.04.01-AM.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-8.04.01-AM.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-8.04.01-AM.png 1600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-07-at-8.04.01-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Crypto isn't going away.

Many of them are ideologically dedicated to the success of cryptocurrency, well before it was as economically impactful as it is today. Many others have billion dollar businesses which are dependent upon the continued and expanded legal acceptance of cryptocurrency. Given that crypto is a significant part of their identity, net worth, and/or business, a "ban" in one country will just result in relocation to another domicile. This includes crypto-holding Indian founders, entrepreneurs, and VCs who would otherwise have invested in or done business in India.</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-21.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-21.png 1000w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image-21.png 1073w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A list of companies that hold BTC can be found at bitcointreasuries.org</figcaption></figure><p>Socially, Indians will respond to a ban by moving overseas to found crypto companies or investing in one of the any foreign entities that now have exposure to cryptocurrency (like <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-announces-over-1b-in-total-bitcoin-purchases-in-2020">MSTR</a> or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1point5-billion-in-bitcoin.html">Tesla</a>). So from a social perspective, all a "ban" does is increase the cost of holding crypto for Indians, and stop crypto investors and founders from entering India.</p><h3 id="banning-crypto-is-not-politically-feasible">Banning crypto is not politically feasible</h3><p>Perhaps the most interesting reason that countries can't ban crypto is that they can't ban other countries. Because we are about to enter a new age of global monetary competition.</p><p>Recall that when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News">Google News</a> launched in 2002, it suddenly pitted every newspaper against each other.

									<p>The U.K. is set to begin the world’s first trial of healthy volunteers being intentionally infected with coronavirus, after the study received ethics approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The so-called human challenge study will begin within a month, said the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in a statement Wednesday, with up to 90 people being exposed to a very small amount of coronavirus in a safe and controlled environment. These kinds of trials are controversial as they expose healthy volunteers to diseases that may be deadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next stage of the study, which has not yet been approved, will involve giving a coronavirus vaccine to different volunteers and then exposing them to coronavirus. Only vaccines that “have proven to be safe in clinical trials” will be used. However, researchers are still a “long way” from this stage of the study, according to Terence Stephenson, chair of the Health Research Authority, which gave ethics approval.</p>

<p>Proponents say these studies provide the fastest way to evaluate new vaccines, especially when the world emerges from an active pandemic, said Robert Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences within medicine at the University of Southampton, who belongs to this camp and is part of the team involved in the study.</p>
<p>This initial part of the study will help doctors understand how the immune system reacts to the virus and identify what affects transmission. The drug&nbsp;Remdesivir will be used as soon as volunteers start developing symptoms. </p>
<p>The volunteers, who are being encouraged to come forward for the study, will be between 18 and 30 and will be exposed to the variant circulating in the U.K. since March 2020. </p>

These are explicit instructions to produce a log line, i.e., a bunch of meaningful text, when code execution passes through a major event. For example, “user X logged in” or “user Y authentication failure”, etc. These lines are what makes the difference between asking your customers “if they tried clearing their browser cache and reload” or actually investigating their complaint.</span></p><p><span>Logging is rather </span><b>explicit</b><span>: Your team needs to add logging code and needs to foresee what to log. The rule of thumb is that all major boundary events need to be logged. Some application bugs only manifest in production, so you should rather “over-log” than “under-log”. Otherwise, a lot of time is wasted hunting so-called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug"><span>Heisenbugs</span></a><span>: bugs that are extremely difficult to reproduce, but nevertheless cause customer annoyance.</span></p><p><span>Logging produces </span><b>massive amounts of data</b><span>. To save costs, it’s best to think in terms of short-term and long-term logs. Short-term logs — e.g., the last 7 days — should be “googleable”, i.e., you should be able to perform a full-text search within seconds. Projects like </span><a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/"><span>Elasticsearch/Kibana</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/"><span>Loki</span></a><span> are most suitable for this purpose.</span></p><p><span>Long-term logs are stored in whatever form is cheapest, usually object storage. They are not immediately “googleable”, then again, the likelihood of needing to search through them is small. In fact, if you want to err on the side of privacy, it might be good to avoid long-term logs.</span></p><p><span>Sometimes, you do not care about the exact log line, rather about the number of times a specific event occurred. This information could be extracted from logs, but there is a more efficient way: metrics.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="df29a40" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><div><figure> <img width="1024" height="576" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics-1024x576.png?x26421" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics-1024x576.png 1024w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics-300x169.png 300w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics-1536x864.png 1536w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Screenshot of Grafana, a leading project for visualizing metrics.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div data-id="05c38aa" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>Metrics — also called Service Level Indicators (SLI) or Key Performance Indicators (KPI) — are time series of numeric values. Think of it like recording outside temperature in all major cities on an hourly basis. Metrics use the</span><b> least amount of space</b><span> and provide (for the space they use) the </span><b>maximum amount of insight</b><span>. They can record the number of hourly active users, the number of requests hitting your application, the amount of free disk space, etc. Keeping an eye on metrics ensures that your users get a great experience with your application, while also keeping infrastructure costs down.</span></p><p><span>Metrics are rather </span><b>explicit</b><span>.

Too much alerting and the system is “crying wolf”. Your team will end up with “alert fatigue” and start ignoring even the important ones.

      <p><strong>An exploration of threads, processes, and coroutines in Python, with interesting examples that illuminate the differences between each.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://python.hamel.dev/cpu.jpg" alt=""> Credit:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As <a href="https://hamel.dev/">a data scientist who is spending more time on software engineering</a>, I was recently forced to confront an ugly gap in my knowledge of Python: concurrency.  To be honest, I never completely understood how the terms async, threads, pools and coroutines were different and how these mechanisms could work together.  Every time I tried to learn about the subject, the examples were a bit too abstract for me, and I hard time internalizing how everything worked.</p>
<p>This changed when a friend of mine<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> recommended <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">a live coding talk</a> by <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/">David Beazley</a>, an accomplished Python educator.</p>
<p><em>Because of restrictions with this YouTube video, I couldn’t embed <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4">the video</a> in this article, so you will have to open it in a different window</em>.</p>
<p>This talk is incredibly intimidating at first.  Not only is it coded live from scratch, but it also jumps immediately into socket programming, something that I had never encountered as a data scientist.  However, if you go through it slowly and understand all the components (as we do in this blog post) it turns out to be the best educational material on Python concurrency I have ever encountered.  This blog post documents what I learned along the way so others can benefit, too.</p>

<p>Before getting started, David sets up the following infrastructure that is used to demonstrate concurrency.</p>
<h2 id="a-cpu-bound-task-fibonacci">A cpu-bound task: Fibonacci</h2>
<p>To demonstrate concurrency, it is useful to create a task that can saturate your CPU (such as mathematical operations) for a noticeable period of time.  David uses a function that computes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci number</a>.</p>

</div>
</div><p>This function takes much longer for large inputs versus smaller inputs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, which allows us to profile different workloads.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-web-server">A Simple Web Server</h2>
<p>A web server is one of the best ways to illustrate different types of concurrency.  However, to really demonstrate how things work it is useful to use something that is sufficiently low level enough to see how all the pieces work.  For this, David sets up a web server using socket programming.  If you aren’t familiar with socket programming, I’ll explain the important bits below, but feel free to dive deeper <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">with this tutorial</a> later if you like.</p>
<p>To begin with, David starts with the below code (I’ve highlighted the most interesting bits):</p>

</div>
</div><p>Here is an explanation of this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines 6-9 are socket programming boilerplate.  It’s ok to just take this for granted as a reasonable way to set up a socket server.  This also matches the <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/">the tutorial</a> I linked to above.</li>
<li>Line 11 waits for an incoming connection from a client.  Once a connection is made, the server can begin receiving data from a client.  The code will stop execution on this line until a connection is made.</li>
<li>Line 13: Once a connection is established, the client object is passed to a function which can handle data sent by the client.</li>
<li>Line 17: waits for data to be sent by the client.  The code will stop execution on this line until data is received from the client.</li>
<li>Line 21: The server sends a response back to the client.  The code <em>could</em> stop execution on this line if the send buffers are full, but unlikely in this toy example.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, the server will only be able to accept a connection from a single client, because the call to <code>fib_handler</code> will never return (because it will run in an infinite loop unless a kill signal is received).  This means that <code>sock.accept()</code> can only be called once.</p>
<p>You can test this out by first running the server:</p>
<p>Then establish a client:</p>
<p>You can type numbers in <a href="https://youtu.be/MCs5OvhV9S4?t=293">as David does in his video</a> and verifies that fibonacci numbers are returned.  However, if you try to connect with another client at the same time from a different terminal session:</p>
<p>You will notice that the second client just hangs and doesn’t return anything from the server.  This is because the server is only able to accept a single connection.  Next, we explore how to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>We can solve this issue with threads.  You can add threads to the handler so that more connections can be accepted with the following code highlighted in yellow:</p>

</div><p>You can verify that this works by connecting two separate clients to the server by running the following command in two separate terminal windows:</p>
<p>By executing the <code>fib_handler</code> in a thread, the main while loop in <code>fib_server</code> will continue, allowing <code>sock.accept()</code> to receive additional clients.  If you haven’t encountered threads before <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/">this tutorial</a> provides a good introduction to the topic.</p>
<h2 id="thread-performance--the-gil">Thread performance &amp; the GIL</h2>
<p>When code stops execution and waits for an external event to occur (like a connection to be made, or data to be sent), this is often referred to as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407589/what-does-the-term-blocking-mean-in-programming">blocking</a>.</p>
<p>One important utility of threads is that it allows blocking tasks to release control of the CPU when the CPU is not being used.  However, the Python interpreter can only run on one thread at a time due to the <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>.  Because Python can only run a single thread at any given time, any CPU-bound work in threads must take turn running one after the other.</p>
<p>Therefore, you have to think carefully about what kind of tasks you execute in threads with Python.  If you try to execute CPU bound tasks, these tasks will slow each other down.  David demonstrates this with the below script that sends requests to our threaded server:</p>

</div><p>If you run several instances of this script (after starting the server first):</p>
<p>You will see the execution times for each script linearly increase as you increase the number of these scripts running in parallel.  <strong>For this particular task, adding threads does not make anything faster.  But why?</strong>  This is because the fibonacci task is CPU bound so threads will compete with each other for resources.</p>
<p>Python threads work by interleaving the execution of different tasks on your CPU.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  Only one thread runs at a time, and have the ability to take turns executing in small bits until all threads are done.  The details of how thread processing is interleaved is carried out by the GIL and your operating system, so you need not worry about this detail (with one exception mentioned below).  Interleaving a bunch of CPU bound tasks will not speed up the total runtime of those tasks.  However, if your tasks involve lots of non-CPU time, such as waiting for network connections, or disk I/O, threading tasks may result in a considerable speedup.  A canonical way of simulating a non-cpu bound task in python is to use the built-in function <code>time.sleep()</code>.</p>
<p>To check my understanding about threads and performance, I ran the below experiment<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and changed <code>time.sleep(2)</code> to <code>fib(20)</code> and back again:</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Polyus&nbsp;spacecraft (<a title="Russian language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language">Russian</a>:&nbsp;<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Полюс</span>,&nbsp;<a title="Geographical pole" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole">pole</a>), also known as&nbsp;Polus,&nbsp;Skif-DM,&nbsp;<a title="GRAU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRAU">GRAU</a>&nbsp;index&nbsp;17F19DM, was a prototype<a title="Space weapon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weapon">orbital weapons platform</a>&nbsp;designed to destroy&nbsp;<a title="Strategic Defense Initiative" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">SDI satellites</a>&nbsp;with a megawatt&nbsp;<a title="Carbon dioxide laser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser">carbon-dioxide laser</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-starwars-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It had a Functional Cargo Block derived from a&nbsp;<a title="TKS spacecraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKS_spacecraft">TKS spacecraft</a>&nbsp;to control its orbit and it could fire test targets to demonstrate the fire control system.</p>
<p>The Polyus spacecraft was launched 15 May 1987 from&nbsp;<a title="Baikonur Cosmodrome" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>&nbsp;<a title="Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_250">Site 250</a>&nbsp;as part of the first flight of the&nbsp;<a title="Energia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia">Energia</a>system,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;but failed to reach orbit.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a title="Yuri Kornilov (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuri_Kornilov&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yuri Kornilov</a>, Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus’ launch,&nbsp;<a title="Mikhail Gorbachev" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>&nbsp;visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country’s previous statements on the USSR’s peaceful intent.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-kornilov-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly. However, after disconnecting from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees. When the rocket fired, it slowed and burned up in the atmosphere over the south Pacific ocean. This failure was attributed to a faulty<a title="Inertial guidance system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_guidance_system">inertial guidance system</a>&nbsp;that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-grondine-4">[4]</a></p><br>

<p>NPO&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;received orders from the&nbsp;<a title="Government of the Soviet Union" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union">Soviet government</a>&nbsp;to begin research on space-based strike weapons in the mid-70s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s,&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;had proposed two programs: laser-equipped&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;and guided missiles platform&nbsp;Kaskad&nbsp;(where&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;would cover the low-orbit targets,&nbsp;Kaskad&nbsp;engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO&nbsp;Astrofizika&nbsp;and KBSalyut, they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the&nbsp;<a title="Salyut program" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_program">Salyut</a>&nbsp;DOS-17K frame.</p>
<p>Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called “pre-emptive retaliation” large-scale Soviet ICBM launch.</p>

<p>The laser chosen for the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the&nbsp;<a title="Beriev A-60" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beriev_A-60">Beriev A-60</a>&nbsp;aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the&nbsp;Energia, capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The massive exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser “recoil-less”. The&nbsp;zero-torque exhaust system&nbsp;(SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite’s purpose. Instead, the xenon-krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth’s&nbsp;<a title="Ionosphere" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>.</p>
<p>In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, which was still in the&nbsp;<a title="Testbed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testbed">testbed</a>&nbsp;phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission.</p>
<p>The launch May 15, 1987, shot by 24 cameras from different angles.</p>
<p>Prelaunch installation&nbsp;04.02.1987</p>
<p>The development of the real&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, the launch pad and the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev’s visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because “there will be heart attacks”.</p>
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif"><img alt="Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif" title="Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987"></a></p>
<p>The catastrophic malfunction that led to&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;entering the atmosphere in the same area as&nbsp;Energia’s&nbsp;second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules’ covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn’t discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the&nbsp;<a title="Ballistic trajectory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trajectory">ballistic trajectory</a>.</p><br>

<p>Plane-overclockers</p>
<p>Powerful airship overclockers (weight 52 tons, length 38 meters, wingspan of 16.5 m) was dispersed to six times the speed of sound (6M), then with his “back” at an altitude of 28-30 km was supposed to start a 10-ton manned orbital plane 8 m long and 7.4 m span.</p>

<p>“The plane-overclockers to 6 Mach suggests the possibility of use as a passenger plane, airliner, which, of course, was rational: its high speed characteristics would allow to raise the rate of civil aviation.”</p>
<p>Plane-overclockers was the first technologically revolutionary detailed design of hypersonic aircraft with jet engines. At the 40th Congress of the International Aeronautical Federation (the FAI), which took place in 1989 in Malaga (Spain), representatives of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) gave the plane-overclockers high praise, noting that he “was designed in accordance with the modern requirements. “</p><br>

<p>In view of the requirements of a lot of money for brand new motor, aerodynamic and material science technologies for the creation of such a hypersonic-overclockers aircraft in the latest versions of the project was considered less costly and more quickly achievable possibility of creating not a hypersonic and supersonic overclockers, as is considered modified shock-reconnaissance aircraft T-4 ( “100”), however it was not realized.</p><br>

<p>Designed primarily to replace the&nbsp;<a title="Soyuz spacecraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_spacecraft">Soyuz spacecraft</a>, Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure&nbsp;<a title="Lifting body" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_body">lifting body</a>&nbsp;design and as<a title="Spaceplane" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane">spaceplane</a>&nbsp;with small&nbsp;<a title="Wing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing">wings</a>.

                    <p>Cycle time is the time it takes to produce value. In software engineering, this is the time between a team starting to develop a feature and delivering this to the customer. Most backlog tools track this data and show it in control charts. You can use cycle time data to predict how long an individual item will take. You can find more explanation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBlnCTu9Ms">here</a>.</p><p>I keep telling the following story over and over when I see teams trying to do Estimation while everyone knows that Estimation is a charade. So I thought I could write it down and share it. I believe a story like this will explain the theory how Cycle Time works better than Estimation in a much more lively way.</p><h2 id="background"><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>At the time of the story, I worked with a team that had a hard time planning. I joined after a Lift &amp; Shift to AWS and the company asked me to help get into control. The platform consisted of multiple legacy systems, all working together in complex ways. Before the migration, the hosting of the platform was outsourced resulting in &nbsp;developers not spending any time on pipelines and maintainability in the decade before.</p><p>We had trouble supporting other development teams consuming our platform due to the many operational incidents. Most of the work on new features stalled. We could never estimate when we would finish new features because work could be disrupted by sudden firefighting in production. After some time and by applying engineering to increase reliability, we started to build features again and people began requesting expected dates again. We estimated those dates, but we did not make those dates time and time again due to unforeseen complexity.</p><figure><img src="https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/2021/01/andrew-gaines-s76S64umXpo-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/andrew-gaines-s76S64umXpo-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/andrew-gaines-s76S64umXpo-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/andrew-gaines-s76S64umXpo-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/andrew-gaines-s76S64umXpo-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Fire Fighting can happen in DevOps teams.</figcaption></figure><p>That we had a major problem became apparent to me when the team started to talk about a new project. I asked what it was about, and the team said they were already refining it for over a year but never came to it. The company expected the team to deliver this big project that would be strategical to the future. But it was unthinkable that we would make any headway in this in the coming time.</p><p>So I proposed we push out this project and have a new team work on it. The new team started delivering after some ramp-up time, but this new team still needed some support from us for some small features on our platform.</p><h2 id="predicting-a-feature-toggle">Predicting a Feature Toggle</h2><p>This new team requested a significant feature in our platform's critical component. We already built this feature and were running it on Acceptance for months. It was turned off in production by a feature flag. Producing this feature would be a simple change in our Configuration as Code and push it to production.</p><p>At the end of a Friday afternoon, the project manager asked our team when we would deliver this feature. The weeks before, he already gave some estimations that we didn't make. So he was reluctant to provide an estimate. At the time, I was telling the team that we should stop with estimation and do more in-depth data-driven planning. So he asked me over: "Hey, what would you say?"</p><figure><img src="https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/2021/01/viva-luna-studios-y3qrbAgm7q8-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/viva-luna-studios-y3qrbAgm7q8-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/viva-luna-studios-y3qrbAgm7q8-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/viva-luna-studios-y3qrbAgm7q8-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/viva-luna-studios-y3qrbAgm7q8-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Estimation can feel like drawing Tarot cards.</figcaption></figure><p>I answered: "Let's pull up the Control Chart to see our Cycle Time.". There we are leaned over the display: the project manager, the team lead, and me. I moved the mouse over the control chart. A pop-up showed our rolling average: '5d 6hr. I stood up straight and said: "Our average is five days 6 hours with a standard deviation of up to two weeks.".</p><p>I could tell confusion from the look of my team lead. How could I say it would take over five days for a change that we estimate to take 10 minutes! I didn't really have the answer, but I just said that it takes us that time to deliver on average. But somehow, it did feel right. We agreed that it would be the first thing picked up on Monday. Satisfied that we at least would work on it, the project manager accepted the answer. Probably this was his goal anyway, not expecting any real date from us seeing our previous performance.</p><h2 id="delivering-a-feature-toggle">Delivering a feature toggle</h2><p>On Monday, we started with the stand-up and discussed picking up this task. Another engineer proposed fixing a bug on another component first before turning on the flag. We would generate a lot of extra load by turning on the feature flag. We could not test this in our acceptance environment. This bug was related to load. The component would make it more likely to handle it by fixing it. We decided to do this because if that component fails, the whole platform will go down. So that is already a day delay.</p><p>At the end of the day, I looked at the board and didn't see the bug moving to the release column. I gathered the team and asked if the bug fix is ready to be deployed after hours. The bug fix was reviewed and tested, ready to be deployed. But as it is such a crucial component for the whole platform, someone reminded us that we had to ask the release manager.</p><p>So we asked the release manager if we could deploy this. He exploded: "No way we can deploy this! We need to request all teams to test this change! I have to notify management if we deploy any changes to that component! That takes a full day." So we planned to release it the next day.</p><p>Tuesday, we notified all teams of our change and asked them to test it. They tested it on Acceptance during the day. They found no problem, so the bug fix was ready to be released in the combined release. Little did we know that a feature by another team was also in the combined changeset. This feature would break on production. After the release, customers started calling, so the release engineer reverted the release. The other team had to fix this bug the next day.</p><p>On Wednesday, the other team saw that the release failed due to their new bug and started to fix it. That evening a new release was scheduled with their and our bug fix. So our bug fix was finally in production.</p><p>So our bug fix was finally in production on Thursday. We turned on the feature flag. The feature started to be available on production and it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/2021/01/spacex--p-KCm6xB9I-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/spacex--p-KCm6xB9I-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/spacex--p-KCm6xB9I-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/spacex--p-KCm6xB9I-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.norberhuis.nl/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/spacex--p-KCm6xB9I-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="capturing-complexity-in-data">Capturing Complexity in Data</h2><p>Our estimation of 10 minutes resulted in a Cycle Time of 4 days and 5 hours. The combination of the level of practices, the complexity of systems, and collaboration between teams caused this delay and are present in any sociotechnical system. These can all be improved, but that is not the point of this story. That takes time and work, while some features need to be delivered in the meantime. As humans, it is impossible to consider all the potential complexity. That is why we cannot estimate correctly.

Afterward, I have seen the same story play out time and time again but due to different complexities: the maturity of third parties, CISO, and so much more. I now never give any estimations anymore. Not using estimation require training.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">

<p>In this article we will explore ‘Apport’, the Ubuntu crash handler. When an application crashes Apport is executed by the kernel, reads information about the crashed process, and then creates a crash report that can be sent to Ubuntu developers.</p>
<p>We will show how we were able to bypass several defense mechanisms, manipulate the crash handler, and get local privilege escalation.</p>

<p>When a process in Linux terminates abnormally, a core file is usually created by the kernel. But what exactly is a ‘core’ file?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In computing, a core dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally.” ~ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a process receives certain signals (for example SIGSEGV or SIGABRT), the default kernel action for these signals terminates the process and creates a coredump file. This file lets us inspect the state of the program at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>By default, a coredump file is named ‘core’ and placed in the current directory of the crashed process, but the path to which the coredump file is written can be configured by writing it to <strong>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</strong>.</p>
<p>Where is Apport configured to be a crash handler? In Ubuntu the content of the core_pattern file is:
“|/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c %d %P %E”.</p>
<p>Let’s break this up:</p>
<p>First, the | character at the start of the file. This is a feature introduced in kernel 2.6.19 to let userspace programs handle a crash: the path after the pipe is the path to the userspace program that will be executed to handle the crash (Apport in our case). The coredump content is given to the program as standard input(stdin).</p>
<p>Next, the % specifiers will be formatted and provided as parameters for the program. Each specifier has a different meaning, which can be found <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html">here</a>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>%p  PID of dumped process, as seen in the PID namespace in
   which the process resides.
%s  Number of signal causing dump.
%c  Core file size soft resource limit of crashing process
   (since Linux 2.6.24).
%d  Dump mode—same as value returned by prctl(2)
   PR_GET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 3.7).
%P  PID of dumped process, as seen in the initial PID
   namespace (since Linux 3.12).
%E  Pathname of executable, with slashes ('/') replaced by
   exclamation marks ('!') (since Linux 3.0).
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Since a user-space process that creates a coredump will be running as root, we have found Apport an attractive attack surface.</p>

<p>Apport starts on a process crash and has two main responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a crash report in /var/crash/ with information such as environ and process maps.</li>
<li>Create a coredump in the current directory of the crashed process.</li>
</ul>
<p>To write the coredump, Apport uses a function named <strong>‘write_user_coredump’</strong> which reads the coredump from the standard input and writes it to a new coredump file in the current directory of the process.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make Apport create a coredump file as root with our controllable user content. That will allow us to write a file as root with our payload (as the file content) in a directory to which our non-privileged user cannot write (more on that later).</p>
<h2 id="so-how-does-apport-determine-core-file-owner">So how does Apport determine core file owner?</h2>
<p>You might think the coredump would be created with the Apport process UID as owner, which is root, but that’s incorrect. In fact, just before Apport writes a coredump, or reads the process information, it drops its privileges to those of the process that crashed. It does this to prevent abuse of its root permissions.</p>
<p>Every process in Linux has three main user and group IDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real user ID and real group ID (ruid and rgid): These determine who owns the process (owner, for example, can send signals).</li>
<li>Effective user ID and effective group id(euid and egid): These determine access to shared resources (messages, queues, shared memory). Changing them will also affect filesystem access permissions.</li>
<li>Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-id: Used in suid and guid programs to save a copy of the initial euid, used to restore suid permissions after dropping privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before entering <strong>‘write_user_coredump’</strong> Apport calls the <strong>‘drop_privileges()’</strong> function which permanently drops privileges to those of the crashed process user (using setuid and setgid).</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Totally drop privs before writing out the reportfile.
</span><span>drop_privileges</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>drop_privileges</span><span>(</span><span>real_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>):</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p><strong>‘drop_privileges’</strong> function drops all Apport privileges according to the variables ‘real_uid’ and ‘real_gid’ taken from the crashed process. This will make Apport write a coredump using the crashed process privileges.</p>
<p>Those variables initialize in an early function called <strong>get_pid_info</strong>.</p>

<p>‘get_pid_info’ reads the <strong>/proc/pid/status</strong> file of the crashed process and parse the lines that contain “Uid:” and “Gid:” from it. It takes the values from the first columns which are RUID and RGID.
We found that we can inject different UID and GID values with a crafted process name.</p>
<p>/proc/pid/status file contains several fields, one of them is ‘Name’ as seen below:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Name:   cat
Umask:  0002
State:  R (running)
Tgid:   14496
Ngid:   0
Pid:    14496
PPid:   13369
TracerPid:      0
Uid:    1000    1000    1000    1000
Gid:    1000    1000    1000    1000
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We found that by creating a process named ‘a\rUid: 0\rGid: 0’ and crashing it, we can manipulate ‘get_pid_info’ to iterate through the lines of /proc/pid/status and parse our injected content.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Name:   a
Uid: 0
Gid: 0
Umask:  0002
State:  R (running)
Tgid:   14497
Ngid:   0
Pid:    14497
PPid:   13369
TracerPid:      0
Uid:    1000    1000    1000    1000
Gid:    1000    1000    1000    1000
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gave us the ability to nullify every call to drop_privileges and stay in root privileges! <span title="Incorrect parsing of /proc/pid/status in Apport"><a href="https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2021000">CVE-2021-25682</a></span></p>
<h2 id="suid-programs">SUID programs</h2>
<p>Even though we can now keep our privileges as root, we still can’t write the coredump as root. This is due to the following check in: <strong>‘write_user_coredump’</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># don't write a core dump for suid/sgid/unreadable or otherwise
# protected executables, in accordance with core(5)
# (suid_dumpable==2 and core_pattern restrictions); when this happens,
# /proc/pid/stat is owned by root (or the user suid'ed to), but we already
# changed to the crashed process' real uid
</span><span>assert</span> <span>pidstat</span><span>,</span> <span>'pidstat not initialized'</span>
<span>if</span> <span>pidstat</span><span>.</span><span>st_uid</span> <span>!=</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>getuid</span><span>()</span> <span>or</span> <span>pidstat</span><span>.</span><span>st_gid</span> <span>!=</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>getgid</span><span>():</span>
    <span>error_log</span><span>(</span><span>'disabling core dump for suid/sgid/unreadable executable'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Apport checks our current uid against whoever created the process. Let’s assume that we invoked the process as uid 1000. If we change our process privileges to root(UID 0) Apport will think that we executed a suid executable (pidstat.st_uid == 1000 and os.getuid() == 0).</p>
<p>To bypass this check, we can start a suid program (pidstat.st_uid == 0) and then drop our privileges (with the vulnerability above) to UID 0 (a normal behavior is that suid program has real UID of the user that started the process).</p>
<p>As we don’t have permission to change the filename of the suid program, we are able to control the process name (in /proc/pid/status) by executing a symlink to the suid program whose name we can control.</p>
<h2 id="dump-mode">Dump mode</h2>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle before writing the coredump file is the process dump mode setting (%d in the process arguments).</p>
<p>The dump mode of the process indicates whether or not this is a suid process. This is a defense mechanism to prevent unauthorized memory access.</p>
<p>We noticed that the dump mode for a normal process crash is 1, and for a suid process 2.</p>
<p>Apport checks whether the process has a dump mode of 1 or 2, and in the case of 2 (suid binary) sets core_ulimit (size of core file to dump) to 0 and will not write any core file!</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>dump_mode</span> <span>=</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>dump_mode</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>if</span> <span>dump_mode</span> <span>==</span> <span>'2'</span><span>:</span>
    <span>error_log</span><span>(</span><span>'not creating core for pid with dump mode of %s'</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span><span>dump_mode</span><span>))</span>
    <span># a report should be created but not a core file
</span>    <span>core_ulimit</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We had an idea! What if we crash a “regular” process (with a dump mode of 1), and while Apport is running we kill the process and “replace” it with a new suid process which will have the same PID as the old one.</p>
<p>This way we can “trick” Apport into thinking that it is handling a “regular” process whereas in reality it is handling a suid process!</p>
<h2 id="pid-recycling">PID recycling</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article">
    <p>When I started my Master's degree in January 2018, I was confident I would be
done in a year and half. After all, I only had one year of classes and I
figured 6 months to write a thesis would be plenty.</p>
<p>Three years later, I'm finally done: the final version of my thesis was
accepted on January 22<sup>nd</sup> 2021.</p>
<p>My thesis, entitled <em>What are the incentive structures of Free Software? An
economic analysis of Free Software's specific development model</em>, can be <a href="https://veronneau.org/media/blog/2021-02-17/m%C3%A9moire.pdf">found
here</a> <sup id="fnref:french"><a href="#fn:french" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you care about such things, both the data and the final
document can be built from source with the code in this <a href="https://gitlab.com/baldurmen/memoire-maitrise">git repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Results and analysis</h2>
<p>My thesis is divided in four main sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>an introduction to FOSS</li>
<li>a chapter discussing the incentive structures of Free Software (and arguing
   the so called “<em>Tragedy of the Commons</em>” isn't inevitable)</li>
<li>a chapter trying to use empirical data to validate the theories presented in
   the previous chapter</li>
<li>an annex on the various FOSS business models</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're reading this blog post, chances are you'll find both section 1 and 4
a tad boring, as you might already be familiar with these concepts.</p>
<h3>Incentives</h3>
<p>So, why <em>do</em> people contribute to Free Software? Unsurprisingly, it's
complicated. Many economists have studied this topic, but for some reason, most
research happened in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Although papers don't all agree with each other and most importantly, about the
variables' importance, the main incentives<sup id="fnref:complex"><a href="#fn:complex" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> can be summarized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>expectation of monetary gain</li>
<li>writing FOSS as a hobby (that includes “<em>scratching your own itch</em>”)</li>
<li>liking the FOSS community and feeling a sense of belonging</li>
<li>altruism (writing FOSS for Good™)</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving weights to these variables is not an easy thing: the FOSS ecosystem is
highly heterogeneous and thus, people tend to write FOSS for different reasons.
Moreover, incentives tend to shift with time as the ecosystem does. People
writing Free Software in the 1990s probably did it for different reasons than
people in 2021.</p>
<p>These four variables can also be divided in two general categories: extrinsic
and intrinsic incentives. Monetary gain expectancy is an extrinsic incentive
(its value is delayed and mediated), whereas the three other ones are intrinsic
(they have an immediate value by themselves).</p>
<h3>Empirical analysis</h3>
<p>Theory is nice, but it's even better when you can back it up with data. Sadly,
most of the papers on the economic incentives of FOSS are either purely
theoretical, or use sample sizes so small they could as well be.</p>
<p>Using the data from the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/">StackOverflow 2018 survey</a>, I thus
tried to see if I could somehow confirm my previous assumptions.</p>
<p>With 129 questions and more than 100 000 respondents (which after statistical
processing yields between 28 000 and 39 000 observations per variable of
interest), the StackOverflow 2018 survey is a <em>very</em> large dataset compared to
what economists are used to work with.</p>
<p>Sadly, it wasn't entirely enough to come up with hard answers. There <em>is</em> a
strong and significant correlation between writing Free Software and having a
higher salary, but endogeneity problems<sup id="fnref:endogeneity"><a href="#fn:endogeneity" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> made it hard to give a
reliable estimate of how much money this would represent. Same goes for writing
code has a hobby: it seems there is a strong and significant correlation, but
the exact numbers I came up with cannot really be trusted.</p>
<p>The results on community as an incentive to writing FOSS were the ones that
surprised me the most. Although I expected the relation to be quite strong, the
coefficients predicted were in fact quite small. I theorise this is partly due
to only 8% of the respondents declaring they didn't feel like they belonged in
the IT community. With such a high level of adherence, the margin for
improvement has to be smaller.</p>
<p>As for altruism, I wasn't able get any meaningful results. In my opinion this
is mostly due to the fact there was no explicit survey question on this topic
and I tried to make up for it by cobbling data together.</p>
<p>Kinda anti-climatic, isn't it? I would've loved to come up with decisive
conclusions on this topic, but if there's one thing I learned while writing
this thesis, it is I don't know much after all.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>

            In this article, we gathered 10 tips to help you improve the user experience of your landing page. A better landing page could give you an edge over your competition and boost your conversions.
          </p><div>
            <p><span>The first contact potential customers have with your online presence is often the landing page of your website. We all know how important first impressions are (and research says you </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>only have 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression</span></a><span> with your web design!), so having a landing page with a great user experience is a must. That is why you need to keep improving the UX of your landing pages to make sure visitors do not close them immediately.</span></p>
<h2><span>Importance of the user experience on the landing page</span></h2>
<p><span>Your website is the face of your business. Especially nowadays, when a big part of the sales takes place online. </span><b>A business without an online presence is no longer considered serious or trustworthy. </b><span>Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the decisions and purchases of your potential clients are now being made from the comfort of their own home, sitting on the couch (or let’s be real – often a toilet seat ). Your customers will scan through many websites, including your competitors in the search of the perfect product, service to satisfy their needs. You can no longer rely on the chance to attract your users. </span><b>Your website needs to stand out</b><span>, and it is your job to provide the best experience possible.</span></p>
<h2><span>10 tips to improve the UX of your landing pageÂ&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>In the world of user experience, even a </span><b>small change can turn into a huge advantage.</b><span> Such an advantage can increase your conversions. We gathered some </span><b>tips that will help you improve your landing pageâ€™s UX.</b></p>
<h2><span>1. Do not make people search to find something</span></h2>
<p><span>Make sure users can get all the information they need with minimal effort. </span><b>Your landing page needs to be simple, intuitive, and contain answers to all the possible questions</b><span> users might have.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remember â€“ </span><b>businesses lose half of their leads just because users canâ€™t find the information</b><span>. This means you need to work on improving your information architecture and take notice of how your content is labeled and grouped into categories to ensure you are not missing out on those leads. </span></p>
<p><span>So your next question should be: </span><b>What can I do about it?</b></p>
<p><span>To make sure your users don’t get confused with the information architecture of your website, you should </span><b>find out their expectations and have a clear understanding of the way they think</b> <i><span>â€œThe Information architecture – IA is the way you organize and structure all the content on your website, app, etc. It is usually represented by your main menuâ€�.</span></i></p>
<p><span>There are two great methods for improving information architecture thus improving user experience that work best together card sorting and tree testing.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Card Sorting</span></h3>
<p><span>Card sorting is a research method allowing you to figure out how people conceptualize and categorize the information found on your website. In simple terms â€“ </span><b>it lets you find out how to group and label your content, so it makes sense to your users. </b><span>You can create a card sorting study in minutes with an online </span><a href="https://www.uxtweak.com/card-sort-tool"><span>Card Sorting tool</span></a><span>.<a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example.png" alt="Card sorting study created in UXtweak" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example.png 1920w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Card-Sorting-study-example-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></span></p>
<p><i><span>Example of a card sorting study with UXtweak Card Sorting tool</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Tree Testing</span></h3>
<p><span>Tree testing is a method that tells you how easily users can find information on your website. If users get lost, it tells you exactly where that is. It is a popular </span><b>method for testing the effectiveness and intuitiveness of information architecture</b><span>. Basically, it is reversed card sorting and is used to verify the results you acquired with card sorting. To utilize the tree testing method, we recommend an online </span><a href="https://www.uxtweak.com/treetest-tool"><span>Tree Testing tool</span></a><span>. <a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example.png" alt="Tree testing stude created with UXtweak for bus company" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example.png 1920w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example-768x432.png 768w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tree-testing-study-example-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></span></p>

<p><span>You can learn more about card sorting and tree testing in</span><a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/card-sorting-101/"><span> Card Sorting 101</span></a><span> and </span><span><a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/tree-testing-101/">Tree Testing 101</a></span><span>. They will provide more information as well as help you with the setup of the studies so you can start creating effective information architectures. As we mentioned before card sorting and tree testing work best when implemented together.

<h2><span>2. Say no to horizontal scroll</span></h2>
<p><span>Nine times out of ten, horizontal scrolling will bring more bad than good for your landing page. Itâ€™s unusual for people and takes a lot more effort than the vertical one. </span><b>Users can hardly guess what information they will get once they click on the arrow, thatâ€™s why they usually skip it</b><span>. Jakob Nielsen – one of the world’s top user experience advocates, considers horizontal scrolling to be </span><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-scrollbars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>one of the top-ten web design mistakes of 2002</span></a><span> but can still be seen to this day. We advise you to take his and our warning against using it.</span></p>
<h2><span>3. Donâ€™t put too much text</span></h2>
<p><span>If your landing page is cluttered with text, users will not be able to quickly find what they are looking for. They will just leave and try elsewhere. So remember to</span><b> keep it simple and straight to the point</b><span>.<a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example.png" alt="Showcase of using right amout of text on website" width="1893" height="924" srcset="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example.png 1893w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example-300x146.png 300w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example-1024x500.png 1024w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example-768x375.png 768w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mailchimp-landing-page-example-1536x750.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1893px) 100vw, 1893px"></a></span></p>
<p><i><span>Here is a good example. Keeping it simple and highlighting CTA. Image source </span></i><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span>Mailchimp</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><span>4. Improve your pageâ€™s loading speed</span></h2>
<p><span>How much time does it take for your page to load? Is it fast enough? We all know how frustrating and annoying a slow website may be. Your landing page</span><b> should be loaded within 0-2 ideally but in a worst-case in 2-4 seconds</b><span>, if not, itâ€™s definitely something you should work on as research on the </span><a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/analytics/research-site-speed-hurting-everyones-revenue.htm#:~:text=The%20first%205%20seconds%20of,(between%20seconds%200%2D5)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Impact of Site Speed on Your Conversion Rate</span></a><span> by Portent in 2019 found out that:</span></p>
<p><i><span>â€œWhen pages load in less than 1 second, the average conversion rate is almost 32%. At a 1-second load time, the conversion rate already drops to 20%. At 2 seconds, the conversion rate begins to level off at 12-13% and reaches its </span></i><b><i>lowest at a 5-second load time.â€�</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Findings of the research are:</i></b><i></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i><span>0-4 second load time is best for conversion rates</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><span>The first 5 seconds of page load time have the highest impact on conversion rates</span></i></li>
<li><i><span>Website conversion rates drop by an average of 4.42% with each additional second of load time (between seconds 0-5)<a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-graph-final.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-graph-final.png" alt="Graph showing dependency of page load time on abandonment rate" width="633" height="381" srcset="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-graph-final.png 633w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/speed-graph-final-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px"></a></span></i></li>

<p><span>A great tip is to compress your images before uploading them on the page.

<h2><span>5. Be browser and mobile-friendly</span></h2>
<p><span>If your website isn’t responsive well, you should get on it immediately. Responsiveness is not a nice-to-have, but an absolute necessity as online users want their content in an easy-to-use format that lets them find what they are looking for.Â&nbsp; If your website is not capable of doing this, they will find one that is.<a href="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website.jpg" alt="Example of non-responsive web design" width="1080" height="2340" srcset="https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website.jpg 1080w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website-138x300.jpg 138w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website-768x1664.jpg 768w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website-709x1536.jpg 709w, https://blog.uxtweak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/non-responsive-website-945x2048.jpg 945w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></span></p>
<p><i><span>You don’t want your website to look like this on mobile devices. Make </span></i><b><i>sure that all parts of it are responsive</i></b><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Make sure your responsive design layout is compatible with all relevant browsers and keeps its integrity.</span></p>
<h2><span>6. Do not forget the Call to Action</span></h2>
<p><span>A call-to-action is a key element on your landing page. It will let your user know what to do next. Without a CTA, the user may get confused, not knowing the next steps, and is likely to leave the page without accomplishing their task.</span></p>
<h2><span>7. Update your web with the latest trends</span></h2>
<p><span>Some things will never get out of style, such as white space and minimalism, for example. However, sometimes itâ€™s good to add something new. Here are some things that will be trending in 2021:Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shadows and gradients</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>They are not new for the designers, but their appearance has changed. Modern gradients are light, airy, made in pastel colors, sometimes mixed with 3D icons. In fact, itâ€™s the same minimalism, just with more volume.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>3D icons and illustrations</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>2D illustrations</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Pastel colors</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>

						Book Launch: Writing Maintainable Unit Tests
					</h2>
					<p><span>
						February 17, 2021
					</span>
				</p></div>

				
<p>I’m very happy to announce that I’ve finished writing my first book <a href="https://leanpub.com/writing-maintainable-unit-tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Writing Maintainable Unit Tests</a>. What an amazing journey it has 
been. I would never have thought that I would be able to write a book. Well now, here we are.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://leanpub.com/writing-maintainable-unit-tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">
        <img src="https://principal-it.eu/assets/img/writing-maintainable-unit-tests-book.jpg" alt="Book cover of 'Writing Maintainable Unit Tests'" width="300">
    </a>
</p>

<p>The ebook has been published on LeanPub, which is available in PDF, EPUB and MOBI formats. There are six chapters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Chapter 1</strong> provides an overview of the different kinds of automated tests and how to apply a healthy mix in a code
base. It also touches on the different flavours of Test-Driven Development.</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter 2</strong> describes the characteristics and principles that make tests maintainable. It touches on a number of
design principles like DRY, DAMP and the Single-Responsibility Principle.</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter 3</strong> discusses the anatomy of automated tests and how a good structure is essential to keep them readable
for our fellow software developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter 4</strong> demonstrates a number of patterns and techniques to keep tests decoupled from the production code. This
is the longest chapter of the book.</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter 5</strong> shows a number of patterns and techniques for writing clear assertions and observations.</li>
  <li><strong>Chapter 6</strong> touches on some miscellaneous principles that are useful for writing maintainable and readable tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, you can have a look at the full <a href="https://leanpub.com/writing-maintainable-unit-tests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">table of contents</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve learned a lot over these past couple of years. It’s my hope that others can learn something as well from reading 
this book. As always, any and all feedback is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>One of the Amazon reviewers of "Sun Performance and Tuning: Java and the
Internet" gave it 3/5 stars. While still a nice introduction, the book by
Adrian Cockcroft has become dated — claimed Roland in 2003, which believe it
or not was 18 years ago. The book Roland reviewed was published in 1998, and it
is a second edition. The first edition (1994) has a significantly different
title: "<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">Sparc &amp; Solaris</a>",
is the focus instead of "Java and the Internet". Other than reflecting a major
shift in Sun’s focus happened between '94, and '98, the two editions also have
a different price tag. "Java and the Internet" costs 15.97 EUR, while one can
get "Sparc &amp; Solaris" used in allegedly <strong>Very Good</strong> conditions for 1.94.  If
I’m buying an outdated book I’m gonna get the most outdated version possible, I
figured, plus imagine the embarrassment if someone would find a book about Java
in my bookshelf. Shipping is 3 bucks, for a grand total of 4.94 EUR the book is
in my hands 15 days after placing the order.</p>

<p>"The Porsche Book" is quick to explain the analogy between UNIX and the Porsche
911 featured on the cover: both were created in the '60s, in a form similar to
the current one. Both represent the latest and greatest of products still around
in 1994, and indeed 2021, despite their quirks.</p>
<p>A valid question at this point clearly is: why do you care about a book
published 30 years ago when there’s so much recent and surely more useful
material? One reason is that I find the history of Sun Microsystems
particularly interesting.  I’ve read and very much enjoyed
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highnoon00kare">High Noon</a> as well as
<a href="https://archive.org/details/sunburstascentof00hall">Sunburst</a> — dealing with
recent history there’s the privilege of having plenty of primary sources
readily available, which is great. When it comes to the Porsche book, I find it
fascinating to read about the most common usage scenarios of Sun servers in the
'90s, and I can’t help but feel sorry for the admin who didn’t know that for
SunOS 4, only filenames up to 14 characters long are cached in the Directory
Name Lookup Cache (DNLC). In this article, however, I want to focus on the
information contained in the book which is still valid today.  In a world that
moves as quickly as the world of computing, you could argue that all books are
outdated to begin with. If some of the information in "Sun Performance and
Tuning" was valid in 1994 and is still valid in 2021, there’s a good chance
that it will still be valid 30 years from now.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we can categorize tech knowledge as follows: theoretical
knowledge, generic practical information, and implementation details. Of the
three, theoretical knowledge is the most likely to stay relevant with time,
followed by generic practical information which might still apply some years
later, and finally implementation details which are very likely to become
irrelevant as time goes by. Those details are far from being useless however:
in fact they provide the distinction between novice and experienced
practitioner. To give an example: the chapter about Networks opens with a
description of the built-in <strong>le</strong> network interface, pointing out that it shared
its DMA connection with the SCSI interface. Crucially, the network interface had
higher priority: heavy network activity was likely to reduce disk throughput. In
1994 you would have needed to see multiple workstations with bad disk
performance before concluding that network traffic had anything to do with it — or read the book.</p>
<p>But what is the content that stood the test of time?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_configuration_factors_and_levels">Configuration Factors and Levels</h2>
<div>
<p>When performing a set of tests, there are multiple settings and knobs one can
work with, each having various options to choose from. Which filesystem are we
using?  What’s the version of the application we’re testing? Kernel buffer
size?</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><b>Factor</b></td><td><b>Level</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Filesystem type</td><td>ext4, xfs, btrfs,...</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS version</td><td>5.10.16, 5.11, ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>vm.dirty_ratio kernel setting</td><td>20, 40, 60, ...</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To measure every combination of 6 different factors with 4 levels each would
take 4^6 = 4096 measurements, which clearly is madness. By reducing the levels
we consider to 2, still evaluating all 6 different factors in all possible
combination, we get down to 2^6 = 64 measurements instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_throughput_response_time_utilization">Throughput, Response Time, Utilization</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Throughput</strong> — the amount of work performed in a given amount of time — was a
thing in the '60s, it’s the same thing today, and it will still be <strong>work/time</strong>
in 2050. Your web server might have a maximum throughput of 10000 requests per
second (rps), that’s something you can use to compare it with another one.
<strong>Response time</strong> (latency) is defined as the amount of time the user has to
wait.  For example, how long did a given database transaction take.
<strong>Utilization</strong> is how much of the computer’s resources were used to do the work.
The values reported by <code>sar</code> and <code>iostat</code>, two tools very much still in use
today, are an example of Utilization measures.</p>
<p>The author suggests taking multiple <code>sar</code> Utilization measurements at various
load levels and combine them with <code>awk</code> to get an overview of how the system
behaves. We do have <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>,
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>, and friends nowadays, but the <code>sar | awk</code> idea
is a useful reminder that quick, simple measurements can go a long way too!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_vmstat_sar_and_iostat_rules">vmstat, sar and iostat Rules</h2>
<div>
<p><code>vmstat</code> and <code>sar</code> are described in detail, with a focus on runnable queue,
blocked queue, swap usage, and so forth. The Linux versions of <code>vmstat</code> and
<code>sar</code> from <a href="https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps">procps</a> and
<a href="http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/">sysstat</a> are a bit different than
the Solaris ones, but the main ideas still apply.</p>
<p>The three commands are also used in the <strong>Rules and Tunables Quick Reference
Tables</strong> section. For each subsystem (Disk, Network, Memory, CPU), the author
specified a list of Rules involving the commands and the action to take if the
rule applies. Rules consist in the name of the command with any options, then a
"." followed by the name of the variable to take into account. For example, the
following indicates a disk bottleneck: <code>35%  &lt; iostat-D30.util &lt; 65%</code>. The
action to take is to try balance the I/O load on other disks too, or get more
disks.</p>
<p>A contemporary version of those rules for Linux would be great to have.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_interrupt_distribution_tuning">Interrupt Distribution Tuning</h2>
<div>
<p>Interrupts in Solaris 2.2 were load-balanced among all available CPUs. The
drawback was that, in case of heavy interrupt load from a given device, cache
hit rate would suffer: the OS allowed to statically assign IRQs to CPUs as an
improvement instead.</p>
<p>Nowadays a very similar problem occurs with the <code>irqbalance</code> daemon on Linux,
which on systems doing lots of network activity should not be used. SMP
affinity should instead be configured to ensure the interrupts of multiqueue
network cards are statically mapped among CPUs.</p>
<p>There’s more information in "Sun Performance and Tuning" that can still provide
valuable lessons today, as well as some true historical gems for those into
such things. Go <a href="https://archive.org/details/sunperformancetu00cock_0">check it
out</a> on the Internet Archive if you’re interested!</p>

	<p><span>Tue 16 February 2021</span></p><p>I have no experience in digital logic design. That is, I didn't until I
recently decided that I would like to try designing my own CPU and running it
on an FPGA! If you too are a software engineer with a vague interest in
hardware design, I hope this series of posts about what I've learnt will be
helpful and interesting. In this first installment, I hope to answer these
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is digital logic design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do I get started, and what tools might I use?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In future installments, I will go into more detail about my CPU design and the
RISC-V architecture, as well as hopefully answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is fundamentally different from software
  design?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about digital logic design is similar to software design?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the code for my CPU at the time of writing
<a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi/tree/47e94dc6e9665f73c871add002c34d1516fd5106">here</a>
or an up to date version <a href="https://github.com/lochsh/riscy-boi">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What is digital logic design?</h2>
<p>Digital logic design is designing logic circuits that operate on binary values.
The elementary components are logic gates: an AND gate, for example, has two
inputs and one output. The output is 1 iff<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> both inputs are 1.</p>
<p>Typically, we design synchronous circuits which use flip-flops to store state,
and thereby synchronise the operation of the circuit to a common clock.
Flip-flops are composed of logic gates.</p>
<p>Analogue circuit design is concerned with the electronic components that make
up logic gates, like transistors and diodes. This level of abstraction is often
needed for applications dealing directly with signals derived from analogue
sensors, like radio receivers. When designing a CPU, this level of abstraction
would not be feasible: modern CPUs can have billions of transistors!</p>
<p>Instead, we use tools that can translate our digital logic design into
different useful formats: the configuration of an FPGA (see below); a
simulation; silicon layout.</p>
<h2>What is an FPGA and why are they used?</h2>
<p>We noted above that the same digital logic design tools can be used whether we
are creating a custom ASIC to be made into silicon, or configuring an FPGA. A
Field-Programmable Gate Array is an integrated circuit containing an array of
programmable logic blocks. You could imagine it is as a big array of logic
gates that can be connected together in various ways.</p>
<p>Making a custom chip generally costs millions, and of course once your chip is
manufactured it cannot be changed. Thus, generally FPGAs are used when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You cannot afford to create a custom ASIC due to lack of capital (e.g. if
  you're just some hacker like me and not ARM or Intel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot afford to create a custom ASIC because your volume is too low to
  make it worth the high one-off costs (e.g. if you are making a small quantity
  of MRI machines with custom data acquisition hardware)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need the flexibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The downsides? FPGAs have a much higher per-chip cost, and they are generally
much slower as a consequence of being able to connect logic blocks together in
very flexible ways. In contrast, a custom design can be reduced to the minimum
number of transistors, with no concern for flexibility.</p>
<p>I think it's helpful context to compare the custom ASIC design process against
that of an FPGA design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Logic design</span>: just like we'd do for an FPGA, the logic design of an ASIC is
  done in a hardware description language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Verification</span>: FPGA designs may well be verified, but you might expect the
  process for an ASIC design to be more rigorous – after all, the design
  can't be changed once manufactured! Often verification will involve formally
  verifying<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> parts of the design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Synthesis</span>: This creates a <em>netlist</em>: a list of logic blocks and their
  connections. The connections are called <em>nets</em>, and the blocks are called
  <em>cells</em>. For both FPGAs and ASICs, the cells are vendor-specific.</p>

<p><span>Placement and routing</span> (P&amp;R): for an FPGA, this involves mapping the logic
  blocks described in the netlist to actual blocks in the FPGA. The resulting
  binary is often called a <em>bitstream</em>.  For an ASIC, this involves deciding
  where to place the cells on the silicon, and how to connect them up. Both
  applications generally use automated optimisation tools for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What tools do I need?</h2>
<h3>A hardware description language: I am using <a href="https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen">nMigen</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></h3>
<p>You may have heard of Verilog or VHDL: both popular hardware description
languages (HDLs). I use "popular" here to mean widely used, not widely loved.</p>
<p>I won't pretend to know much about these tools: I only know that smarter people
than me with vast logic design experience have a lot of hate for them.
Due to the problems with Verilog and other similar tools, there have been
various attempts at making more useful and friendlier alternatives.  nMigen is
one such project, which creates a domain-specific language in Python. In their
own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and
VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven
model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for
synchronous circuits, which represent the lion's share of today's logic
designs. Counterintuitive arithmetic rules result in steeper learning curves
and provide a fertile ground for subtle bugs in designs. Finally, support for
procedural generation of logic (metaprogramming) through "generate"
statements is very limited and restricts the ways code can be made generic,
reused and organized.</p>
<p>To address those issues, we have developed the nMigen FHDL, a library that
replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and
synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave
like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design's logic to
be constructed by a Python program. This last point enables hardware
designers to take advantage of the richness of the Python language—object
oriented programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading,
libraries, etc.—to build well organized, reusable and elegant designs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If, like me, you've never used Verilog, then not all of this will have more
than abstract meaning to you. But it certainly sounds promising,
and I can attest that it has been very straightforward to get started with
logic design without the reportedly large barrier of grappling with Verilog. I
would recommend it, particularly if you are already familiar with Python!</p>
<p>The only downside I can think of is that nMigen is still in development, and
in particular the documentation is not complete. There is a helpful community
at #nmigen on <a href="https://mcla.ug/blog/chat.freenode.net">chat.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<h3>A wave viewer for inspecting simulations: I am using <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a></h3>
<p>nMigen provides simulation tooling: I use it in my tests, written using
<code>pytest</code>. I record the signals during these tests and view them in a wave
viewer to help debug.</p>
<p><img alt="gtkwave" src="https://mcla.ug/blog/images/gtkwave.png" title="A screenshot of GTKWave"></p>
<h3>Optional: An FPGA dev board. I am using a myStorm BlackIce II</h3>
<p>You don't need an FPGA dev board to create your own CPU. You could do
everything in simulation! The fun of having a board to work with, for me, is
being able to flash LEDs and see my design in action.</p>
<p>Of course, if you were creating something more useful than my very basic CPU,
then you would probably want some hardware to run it on, and this would be less
"optional"!</p>
<h2>Getting started with nMigen</h2>
<p>Rather than immediately trying to design a CPU, I started by making an
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in nMigen. The ALU is a key piece of any CPU design
that I have seen: it performs arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>Why start with this? I knew I would need an ALU for my CPU; I knew I could make
a simple one; I knew that the feeling of making something is an important
motivator when starting a new project!</p>
<p>My design looked something like this:</p>

<p>As you can see, we've created a lot of nMigen <code>Signal</code> instances to represent
well...the signals that define the interface to our ALU! But what is this
<code>elaborate</code> method? My understanding is that "elaboration" is the name for the
first step in synthesising the netlist (see above). The idea in the nMigen code
above is that we've created some <em>elaboratable</em> structure (by inheriting from
<code>nm.Elaboratable</code>), i.e. something that describes digital logic we want to
synthesise. The <code>elaborate</code> method describes that digital logic. It has to
return an nMigen <code>Module</code>.</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look at the contents of the <code>elaborate</code> method. The
<code>Switch</code> will create some kind of decision logic in the synthesised design.
But what is <code>m.d.comb</code>? nMigen has the concept of synchronous (<code>m.d.sync</code>)
and combinatorial<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> (<code>m.d.comb</code>) control domains. From the nMigen
<a href="https://nmigen.info/nmigen/latest/lang.html#lang-domains">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A control domain is a named group of signals that change their value in
identical conditions.</p>
<p>All designs have a single predefined <em>combinatorial domain</em>, containing all
signals that change immediately when any value used to compute them changes.
The name comb is reserved for the combinatorial domain.</p>
<p>A design can also have any amount of user-defined <em>synchronous domains</em>, also
called clock domains, containing signals that change when a specific edge
occurs on the domain’s …</p></blockquote></div></div></div>

</p>
<div>
<p><strong>The email industry's got a GDPR problem.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent <a href="https://email.geeks.chat/">Email Geeks Community</a>, but if you're new, let me break it down for you.</p>
<p>Last year, the GDPR came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (PII) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as PII). </p>
<p>Now if you're reading this, you're probably familiar with how that's gone, so I won't bore you with the details.</p>

<h2>So What's the Problem?</h2>
<p>The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to them. This isn't strictly a problem, the GDPR does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking frequently fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>We're not collection consent to track user behaviour</strong> - That means we're probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that's frought with a number of risks.</p>
<p>Firstly, most brands aren't disclosing in their privacy policies or at moment of signup that they're tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That's a problem. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is further expanded upon in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/">Recital 39</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand's privacy policy is a clear breach of the regulation.</p>
<p>Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/">Right to Object</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second problem.</p>

<h2>Email Marketing Platforms Are Not GDPR Compliant†</h2>
<p>Take a look at your ESP, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email tracking?</p>
<p>If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you're in breach of the GDPR as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don't you're already in breach.</p>
<p>This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate Interest.</p>
<p>So what can you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Complain to your ESP!</strong> Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the GDPR is here to stay, and ESP's must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the law.</p>

<h2>Where Does That Leave Email Marketing?</h2>
<p>Email marketing isn't going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn't going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal data.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>That's not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our objectives.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we've become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it's time we get used to a world where that option isn't always going to be available to us. </p>
<hr>
<p>Usual caveats apply. I am not a lawyer.</p>
<p>† <em>Yes, I know a small minority are, but they're a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I'd recommend SFMC</em></p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/top-5-cloud-to-cloud-migration-woes-and-how-to-solve-them/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Lars Larsson, Senior Cloud Architect and Branch Manager</em> at <em>Elastisys</em></p>



<p>All companies that use cloud services do so for a reason. But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs. Make sure to fully understand the situation as you make your calculations.</li><li>Providers tend to lock in customers via well-integrated services. These may make migration more difficult.</li><li>Make clear inventory of features and functionality your application requires of a managed service. These may or may not match what other cloud providers offer.</li><li>Also make an inventory of the tools and services supporting your organizational processes.</li><li>Take all these inventories into account to calculate your total cost of ownership for any cloud-to-cloud migration.</li><li>Use cloud native technologies to decouple your application and organization from the services offered by a particular cloud provider. This makes migration easier in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Pricing models vary wildly</h2>



<p>Most companies have been hit by that one cloud bill that surprised them. Some services or features wound up costing far more than originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you considering a cloud-to-cloud migration to reduce operational costs? If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p>



<p>Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p>



<p>Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p>



<p>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be. My trick is to look at your past few detailed billing statements, and map those costs to your new cloud provider options.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Deeply take all aspects of your current cloud billing into account. Find the differences between offerings, and make a more informed decision.</em></li></ul>



<h2>2. Cloud vendor-specific integrations</h2>



<p>Tell me, did you adopt Kubernetes to make yourself less dependent on cloud providers? Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p>



<p>What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p>



<p>Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p>



<p>As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p>



<p>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations. Choose third-party vendors that are not tied to any particular cloud provider, and can offer their services on top of other cloud providers if need be.</em></li></ul>



<h2>3. The devil is in the (technical) details</h2>



<p>Almost all organizations I’ve talked to say the same thing. They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</p>



<p>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/">their announcement</a>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</p>



<p>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</p>



<p>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once”&nbsp;<strong>processing</strong>&nbsp;guarantees, however, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed">does not imply exactly once delivery</a>.) So confusing for an application that was coded with assumptions of RabbitMQ’s “at most once” delivery guarantees!</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Most people's eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed</p><p>Read the whole article "CTO Headaches: Top 5 cloud-to-cloud migration woes" for more<a href="https://t.co/exLGZu5SZG">https://t.co/exLGZu5SZG</a></p></div>— elastisys (@elastisys) <a href="https://twitter.com/elastisys/status/1358795732132769794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The point I am making here is that you must make an inventory of all the cloud services you use, and what features in these are key to your applications working the way they are intended. Because&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;use case is the one that matters.</p>



<p>Cloud providers offer services that make certain trade-offs to ensure the scalability and availability&nbsp;<em>of their service</em>. From the perspective of individual customers and applications, the ideal trade-off choice might have been different. If you use a software such as RabbitMQ, you can configure it perfectly for your use case and requirements. Not the ones of the cloud providers. There are companies that offer managed services in a cloud-agnostic way. Especially on top of Kubernetes, which deserve your consideration.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Make a clear inventory of all cloud services you use, along with the required features of each for your use case. To make a cloud-to-cloud migration easier, start depending on software not tied to any particular provider.</em></li></ul>



<h2>4. Tools supporting your processes (may) change</h2>



<p>Industry wisdom and rule of thumb says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.econnectivity.se/app-maintenance-cost-can-be-three-times-higher-than-development-cost/">about 70% of software costs</a>&nbsp;are in maintenance. Not development. Just keeping the thing running as intended. How do you address that? My take on it is to rely on smart tools and automation as much as possible. The less your staff has to work on rote menial tasks, the better. Everything they do is a process. So let’s talk about those processes.</p>



<p>Operating your mission-critical cloud application? A bunch of processes. And most, if not all, of these are supported by tools. Continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, notifications and alerting. These are the tools your operations staff is using to analyze and optimize your application deployment.</p>



<p>Great tools like AWS CloudWatch offer insight into monitoring, logging (CloudWatch Logs), and containerized workloads (CloudWatch Container Insights). Your team probably depends on them. But they are specific to a particular cloud vendor.</p>

<h2><span id="Kill_the_alarm_clock.21">Kill the alarm clock!</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_epidemic">Alarm clock epidemic</span></h3>
<p>Few upwardly mobile people in the modern rat-race society can live without an alarm clock. With a shot of strong coffee and round-the-clock stress, most people learn to live and survive with an alarm clock. Half of the population wakes up with an alarm, 9% are woken by a partner, 4% by pets, 3% by children, etc. That leaves a minority that wake up naturally. Increasingly, time becomes the most precious commodity in society where achievement is often associated with speed and perfect time-management. However, alarm clocks introduce harmful side effects: stress, sleep debt, and worst of all, disruption of the natural physiological sleep function. At worst, those factors will result in physical damage to the brain (e.g. such sensitive structures as the hippocampus, your memory switchboard, may literally <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">lose neurons as a result of disrupted sleep</a>).
</p><p>The art of time-management makes it possible to live at a high speed with an alarm clock at your side, and still be free from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a>. However, the societal damage inflicted by alarm clocks and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> is unforgivable. An alarm clock that interrupts your sleep damages your memories, your ability to learn, your creativity, your mood and temper, your relationships with other people, your ability to focus, and your overall intellectual performance!
</p><p>Dr Robert Stickgold has shown that people who learn a skill during the day do not show significant improvement until they get 7-8 hours of good sleep<sup id="cite_ref-stickgold-2005_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-stickgold-2005-1">[1]</a></sup>. There was a noticeable correlation between the degree of improvement and the quality of sleep received. My own work with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_habits#SleepChart_in_SuperMemo" title="Sleep habits">SleepChart</a> also shows that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning" title="Sleep and learning">use of alarm clocks can dramatically reduce memory recall and consolidation</a>. Forgetting is so painless that we rarely notice its effects. In a natural way, forgetting will proceed even if you get as much sleep as you need, and it is difficult to point to specific memories lost as a result of not sleeping enough. Moreover, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">sleep deprivation may leave your memories intact while their storage will be sub-optimum</a>. The difference may be impossible to spot without measurement. We are more likely to notice sleepiness, reduced mental agility, or bad mood.
</p><p>Disrespect for sleep has reached biblical proportions. This is most noticeable in the US and other highly industrialized nations. <i>Men's Health's</i> Dan Vergano writing for <i>ABC News</i> in <i>"No More Rude Awakenings"</i> suggests a seven-day system for fighting sleepiness: <i>"The secret is to fuel that arousal system so it can <b>beat the pants off the sleep system</b>. By creating the kind of feel-good expectations that trigger hormones to wake the brain, you’ll override the need to sleep and be able to jump out of bed like a man on fire"</i>. The article suggests a "fresh" mind method that capitalizes on the fact that stress hormones help keep you alert. However, the only rational remedy for <i>"rude awakenings"</i> is simple: get enough sleep! Jumping <i>like a man on fire</i> is not likely to have a positive effect on your creative potential!
</p><p>You may often notice that waking up with an alarm clock gives you a jumpstart for the day. You may then come to believe that using the alarm clock might help you stay alert later in the day. This is not the case. The alarm signal simply scares your brain into wakefulness, disrupting the carefully planned process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">neural optimization</a> that occurs in sleep. As a result, you get an immediate injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and your levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a> also increase. This is cortisol that peaks at awakening in natural sleeping rhythm that provides you with the fresh-mind impression. With passing time, this cheaply gained alertness will wear thin unless you continue abusing your physiology with more "remedies". You may use more scare tactics for keeping yourself alert, abuse caffeine, or even get a more profound effect with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">modafinil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. Alertness should be achieved with the help of sufficient sleep, not despite the lack of sleep! Apart from your reduced ability to learn new things, all unnatural anti-drowsiness methods will produce a great deal of side effects that can be pretty damaging to your health in the long run.
</p><p>All efforts to overcome sleepiness by means other than sleep itself can be likened to a chase of the first high in the use of psychoactive substances. If you drink buckets of coffee, do pushups, pour cold water over your head, or slap your face, you only dip into the last reserves of your alertness hormones that only worsen the effects of deprivation after the effects of the stimulation wear off, which is usually a matter of minutes. Rarely can you get a boost lasting more than an hour, and the more you perk up, the lower you fall in the aftermath.
</p>
<h3><span id="Insomnia_trap">Insomnia trap</span></h3>
<p>If your life without an alarm clock may seem like an impossibility, you will probably need to use all methods in the book to be sure you get enough sleep and minimize the damage. If you need to wake up early at the cost of your brain, avoid the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia trap</a></b>! Insomnia trap is a vicious circle of:
</p>
<ol><li> going to sleep too early to get more sleep,</li>
<li> failing to fall asleep in time (or worse, waking up prematurely),</li>
<li> feeling even more tired on the next day, and</li>
<li> going to sleep even earlier on the next day to catch up with the lost sleep.</li></ol>
<p>It is better to go to sleep at a natural hour (i.e. a bit later), wake up early, suffer a degree of sleep deprivation, and hope for a phase reset that will make it possible to continue on the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">designer schedule</a>. For a solution to the insomnia trap see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia" title="Curing DSPS and insomnia">Curing DSPS and insomnia</a>.
</p><p>If you cannot reset your phase and still feel tired when getting up early on a regular basis, consider choosing a job that is acceptable for your body, not the other way around. Your long-term health and well-being is at stake. If you absolutely cannot live without an alarm clock, you can at least start from changing your mindset about the importance of sleep and ensure you do not impose wrong habits on your children. Perhaps the young ones will be lucky enough to work in a flex-time system that will make it possible to get sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep. At least, do not set a bad example!
</p>
<h3><span id="Wake_up_the_President">Wake up the President</span></h3>
<p>President Bill Clinton was woken up twice by telephone during the night of April 22, 2000 before the infamous I.N.S. raid on the home of Miami relatives of the young Cuban exile Elian Gonzales. He was probably the most often disrupted and sleep deprived president in history. Only after a heart surgery did Clinton take diet, sleep and (real) exercise seriously. Those interrupted nights would definitely influence his performance and the quality of his decisions! Has anybody thought of a rule: <i>Do not wake up the president?</i> A rule that could only be revoked in a true national emergency? President G. W. Bush (b. 1946) was woken up when an American spy plane landed in China in 2001. He was also woken up after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002. George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) and Hilary Clinton made "waking up in the middle of the night" part of their presidential campaign and prowess. It seems that only Ronald Reagan had pretty strong rules for protecting his own sleep. He also famously napped during some cabinet meetings. He slept through a couple of international events without an apparent negative impact on his somewhat delayed decision-making. Critics would say he slept through the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Was Reagan so protective of sleep because he understood the role of sleep better, or perhaps he was just a bit lazier than other presidents? I don't know. However, he sure set a good example.
</p>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_monsters">Alarm clock monsters</span></h3>
<p>Andrea K. wrote to me with skepticism: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Take the alarm clock away from a typical person and they won't just wake up on their own at their desired time and they will miss work, school, or whatever. An alarm clock can't be that bad for you because of the simple fact that most people use it and I never noticed any problem with them&nbsp;:) Everyone in my family has been using one since they were children, and no one suddenly went crazy or began to mutate into a monster (yet)!"</i></p></blockquote> 
<p>When you use an alarm early in the morning in order to get to work or to school, you cut off the later stages of sleep. If the intrusion into natural sleep is not large (e.g. from minutes to an hour), the damage may be limited and hard to notice. Alarm clock will do far more damage if it cuts deep into the middle of the night sleep. You can compare the use of alarm clocks to smoking or eating hot dogs. The harm is not great enough to be instantly noticeable. It took the public many years to largely accept that "smoking is bad" or "fast food is bad". It is hard to quantify the degree of damage. However, as we move to knowledge society where our intellectual performance becomes increasingly important, the effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> will come under closer scrutiny and alarm clocks are bound to gradually fall out of favor. Unlike hot dogs, they are already universally hated by their users. Most people are able to somewhat adapt their sleep to their schedules if their routines are regular enough. When those people need to resort to the use of the alarm clock, they cut less of their sleep and the damage is proportionally smaller. Nevertheless, we should always strive at eliminating alarm clocks altogether. Most of all, we should protect our kids from suffering interrupted sleep!

<p><em>CubeSat GPS antennas and GNSS systems are important for effective navigation, coordination, and payload operation. This article gives an overview of antennas that have been developed for nanosatellites, CubeSats and other small satellite form factors that are available on the global space marketplace.</em></p>



<p><em>The article begins with a brief introduction to GNSS systems and technology, but if  you would like to skip straight to the product listings, <a href="#products">please click here</a>.</em></p>



<hr>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>As the range of applications that small satellites can carry out grows, and the systems themselves get smaller thanks to electronic miniaturization, it is increasingly important for operators to be able to access accurate information on their position while in orbit.</p>



<p>Effective attitude control systems enable responsive position fixes in orbit, while communications systems (operating in the <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-02-27-an-overview-of-satellite-x-band-transmitters-available-on-the-global-marketplace">X-</a>, <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-05-19-s-band-antennas-on-the-global-marketplace-for-space">S-</a>, or <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-12-16-satellite-uhf-and-vhf-transceivers-and-transmitters">UHF band</a> for example) that connect to the ground also allow satellite operators to take more active, manual control by sending commands to the relevant actuators.</p>



<p>Another option is for a small satellite to make use of the regionally or globally available satellite positioning systems that were primarily developed for navigation on Earth.</p>



<p>The general term for such networks is Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with the Global Positioning System (GPS) being the most well-known.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How satellite GNSS networks operate</h2>



<p>GNSS networks are constellations of large satellites in higher Earth orbits; typically Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), at altitudes of approximately 2,000 – 35,000 km, or Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) at an altitude of 35,786 km.</p>



<p>These constellations produce global signals, across a range of frequency bands, which are picked up by terrestrial GNSS receivers in order to give accurate position information on the ground.</p>



<p>These are the signals used by your car’s satnav, your fitness tracking app when out for a run, or that give live location information on an expected parcel’s delivery.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210216_satsearch_cubesat_gps_antennas_car_satnav-1024x683.jpg" alt="CubeSat GPS antennas on the global market - car satnav" width="536" height="357" srcset="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210216_satsearch_cubesat_gps_antennas_car_satnav-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210216_satsearch_cubesat_gps_antennas_car_satnav-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210216_satsearch_cubesat_gps_antennas_car_satnav-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210216_satsearch_cubesat_gps_antennas_car_satnav.jpg 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px"></figure></div>



<p>By adapting ground-based equipment, or by basing new designs for space on them, sub-system manufacturers have developed <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-11-12-an-overview-of-gps-receivers-for-small-satellites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNSS receiver systems for satellites</a> that enable navigation information and positing activities on a CubeSat or other small satellite.</p>



<p>There are various structural differences between terrestrial and space-based GNSS equipment.</p>



<p>For example, on Earth such devices are usually built from low-cost, widely-available, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts. To operate effectively in space such components may need to be adapted to meet the huge thermal and mechanical stresses of launch, radiation-hardened, and made suitable for operating in a vacuum.</p>



<p>CubeSat GPS antennas and GNSS antennas play an important role in the acquisition and translation of the GNSS signal originating at one or more of the existing networks.</p>



<hr>



<h2>GNSS networks</h2>



<p>There are several GNSS networks giving coverage across one or more countries and territories. Such networks have been launched by sovereign nations, international organizations, and even private companies.</p>



<p>Global satellite-based navigational systems play a fundamental role in many aspects of industrial activity, military operations, and in consumer products.</p>



<p>Satellite GNSS equipment will often have the ability to connect to multiple networks as needed, in order to extend coverage spatially, and to provide redundancy in the case of one signal being unreachable.</p>



<p>This list below gives an overview of the different networks that a small satellite antenna may be able to interact with: </p>



<hr>



<p><strong>GPS</strong></p>



<p>The <em>Global Positioning System (GPS)</em> is the most common GNSS around the world. It is owned by the United States government and plays a major role in a wide variety of industrial processes, consumer products, defence applications, and intelligence services.</p>



<p>Note that GPS is often used synonymously with GNSS, but in fact <em>GPS is simply a type of GNSS</em>, in the same way that a <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-07-25-reaction-wheels-an-overview-of-attitude-control-systems-available-on-the-global-marketplace-for-space">reaction wheel</a> is a type of attitude control system.</p>



<p>The GPS is operated and maintained by the U.S. Air Force and more in-depth information is available at <a href="https://www.gps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPS.gov</a>, a website maintained by the National Coordination Office for Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing.</p>



<p>CubeSat GPS antennas enable systems to connect to the primary GPS frequency in the L-Band, between 1 and 2 GHz. </p>

<p><strong>GLONASS</strong></p>



<p>The <em>Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema</em>, or <em>Global Navigation Satellite System</em>, is typically referred to as <em>GLONASS</em>. Initially covering the former Soviet Union, GLONASS now has worldwide coverage and enables satellite navigation systems to use it alongside GPS for faster, more accurate position fixing.</p>



<p>GLONASS is a major part of the Russian space agency Roscosmos’ operations and operates <a href="https://www.everythingrf.com/community/glonass-frequency-bands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the following bands</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>G1 Band</strong>: 1589.0625 MHz to 1605.375 MHz</li><li><strong>G2 Band</strong>: 1242.9375 MHz to 1248.625 MHz</li><li><strong>G3 Band</strong>: 1201 MHz</li></ul>



<hr>



<p><strong>Galileo</strong></p>



<p>A GNSS created by the European Union (EU) through the European Space Agency (ESA) and now operated by <a href="https://www.gsc-europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the European GNSS Agency (GSA)</a>.</p>



<p><em>Galileo</em> was created to enable Europeans to access a global positioning system independent of GPS or GLONASS, and is freely available worldwide to an accuracy of 1 meter, which can be increased to 1 centimeter in an encrypted form for commercial customers, in the High Accuracy Service (HAS).</p>



<p>Galileo operates in the 1.1 to 1.6 GHz band; a frequency range that is well-suited to mobile navigation and communication services.</p>



<p>Each Galileo satellite is designed to broadcast 10 different navigation signals making it possible for Galileo to offer open (OS), safety-of-life (SOL), commercial (CS) and public regulated services (PRS).</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>BeiDou</strong></p>



<p>The <em>BeiDou Navigation Satellite System</em> is generally referred to as <em>BeiDou</em>, or simply <em>BDS</em>, and is a worldwide GNSS created and run by the People’s Republic of China. The system was formerly called Compass and began its life by offering regional coverage in China before branching out globally.</p>



<p>Now in its third phase of development, the BeiDou system provides connectivity in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeiDou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the following open service channels</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>B1I</strong>: 1561.098 MHz</li><li><strong>B1C</strong>: 1575.42 MHz</li><li><strong>B2I</strong>: 1207.14 MHz</li><li><strong>B2a</strong>: 1176.45 MHz</li><li><strong>B2b</strong>: 1207.14 MHz</li><li><strong>B3I</strong>: 1268.52 MHz</li></ul>

<p><strong>IRNSS</strong></p>



<p>The<em> Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)</em> is a regional GNSS owned and operated by the Government of India via the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It also has the operational name <em>Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC)</em>.</p>



<p>NavIC satellites use dual frequency bands that provide signals in the L5-band and S-band. The system is designed to provide accurate position information in a primary service area that covers India and a region extending up to 1,500 km from the country’s borders.</p>



<p>It also offers a level of coverage in an extended service area that lies between the primary service area and area enclosed by a rectangle from Latitude 30 deg South to 50 deg North, Longitude 30 deg East to 130 deg East. You can find out more about the system <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/irnss-programme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ISRO site</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>QZSS</strong></p>



<p>The <em>Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)</em> is also a regional GNSS, in this case owned by the Government of Japan and operated by QZS System Service Inc. (QSS).</p>



<p>It is designed to complement GPS coverage in Oceania and East Asia and is sometimes referred to as <em>the Japanese GPS</em>. The constellation provides the following signals:</p>

<p>More information on each of these GNSS networks is available on the operators’ websites and <a href="https://blog.bliley.com/the-differences-between-the-5-gnss-satellite-network-constellations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this excellent article by Bliley Technologies</a>.</p>



<p>Now that you have been introduced to the use cases for GNSS and GPS connectivity in small satellites, and gained an understanding of the major GNSS constellations which they may access – let’s next take a look at what you may want to consider when selecting a small satellite GNSS or CubeSat GPS antenna for your individual needs.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Understanding your requirements</h2>



<p>We recommend a simple four-step approach for the preliminary selection of any new piece of hardware or software for a satellite or other space system.</p>



<p>Note that this is just a basic guide based on what we’ve learned helping hundreds of buyers select products within our marketplace and get rapid responses from suppliers.</p>



<p>It is just meant to help engineers make an initial assessment and shouldn’t replace formalised systems engineering approaches such as the <a href="https://www.incose.org/incose-member-resources/working-groups/Application/space-systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INCOSE Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) CubeSat frameworks</a>.</p>



<ol><li>Specify your currently known mission parameters,</li><li>Record all currently known overall design specifications of the system,</li><li>Consider the range of technology that will be used in the satellite and in ancillary sub-systems, and</li><li>Take into account the key performance criteria of the kind of product you wish to procure.</li></ol>



<p>These criteria are explained in more detail below.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Mission parameters</h3>



<p>The first step is to fully understand the currently known mission parameters, including both the critical applications and desirable, but not necessarily essential, objectives.</p>



<p>Typically the more precise mission parameters will only be established later in the process – usually iterated upon in a number of loops by considering the “system of systems.”</p>



<p>But having an idea of what functions your selected technology is likely to need to perform, and on what schedule and duration, will make selecting the most suitable model mch easier.</p>



<p>Also consider the launch stresses, testing processes and regulatory compliance that the product will need to go through in order to make it …</p></div></div></div></div>

I find that with posters the creator has to be clever with their use of space and this leads to some wonderful shapes and arrangements.</p><p>There is a website by the artist Mike Joyce called <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.swissted.com/">swissted.com</a></span> that has a plethora of amazing posters with intricate and exciting layouts. I highly recommend checking it out if you want to get inspiration or just have a layout you want to practice.</p><hr><p>This tutorial will cover the re-creation of a poster with straight up <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code> and <code>JavaScript</code>. We'll use <code>[GSAP](https://greensock.com/)</code> to animate elements of our poster and also learn how to load a custom font. The poster in question can be seen below, it is created by Mike Joyce and taken from their <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.swissted.com/products/pixies-at-the-rat-1986">site</a></span>.</p><p>The finished project can be view here: <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout.netlify.app/">css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout.netlify.app</a></span>.</p><p>The source code can be viewed here: <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/molebox/css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout">github.com/molebox/css-grid-and-gsap-poster-layout</a></span></p><p>We are not going to need to install anything, open vscode (or your choice of IDE) and create the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>A <code>font</code> folder</li><li>A <code>styles</code> folder.

We want it to be the height of the viewport and the margin centers our content. We have set the overflow to hidden as we will be doing some positioning later on and this will hide some of the overflowing elements.</p><p>main-grid</p><p>Looking at the poster we could go for a flexbox layout and use a direction of column, stacking all the elements vertically. That would be a viable solution, but to have a little more control over the size of each column and its placement we can instead use the grid. We are setting an explicit height on the top section and the title section then saying the rest (which is made up of the circles) should take up the rest of the available space, or 1 fractional unit.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.main-grid</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>50</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>fr</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>info-section</p><p>The top section of the poster, with the two paragraphs of text will also utilize the grid. Flexbox would indeed be a good solution here, we could have used <code>justify-content: space-between</code> and then a padding on the horizontal of each text section to push them to the edges of the pages but with some padding from the actual edge. In keeping with using grid however, we can use a nifty feature of the <code>auto</code>cloumn size to set a defined width on the elements on the edges but an auto size in between, pushing the outer elements apart. The left and right section of text use flexbox with a direction of column.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.info-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  p</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.8</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-left</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.section-right</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>title-section</p><p>We are on a roll with grid! Let's use another one. Here we will be defining the width of each text section whilst also setting the rows height to that of the given second section in the <code>main-grid</code> class. The subtitle, that is, the text on the right which is split into three rows, was a little more fiddly to get right. Our final result is ok but it's not 100% accurate.</p><p>Due to the size of the title text on the left we use a cheeky <code>margin-top</code> to push the three rows down a tad, this gives our eyes the impression that these three rows are centered to the big text on the left. That's not actually true due to the dots on the <code>i</code> raising the height of the title text.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.title-section</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-row</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> grid</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-columns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>400</span><span>px</span><span> auto </span><span>300</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>grid-template-rows</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>200</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>align-items</span><span>:</span><span> center</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>%</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.title</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>500</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>letter-spacing</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>.subtitle</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>grid-column</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>color</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--white-color</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span> flex</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span><span> column</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>padding</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-size</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.3</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>font-weight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>justify-content</span><span>:</span><span> space-evenly</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>150</span><span>px</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>margin-top</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>em</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>circles-grid</p><p>Our final class is the most "complicated". If we take a look at the original poster we can count how many circles we see, it's an 11x11 grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function allows us to set a repeating pattern of sizes in one short statement. For the columns we are saying that there should be 11 columns, each taking up the available space until they reach each end of the parent container. We do the same for the rows except that we explicitly state the height of the rows so that the child elements sizing more closely resemble that of the original poster.</p><p>Remember we set the <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the <code>outer-cointainer</code>? Here we can see why. When looking at the original poster we can see the circles on the horizontal edges are cut off, they are semi-circles. Now, rather than creating some special semi-circle shapes we set the width of this section (this grid) to be slightly larger than the parent container, and by hiding the overflow we give the illusion that the circles are semi-circles contained within our bounderies.</p><p>We use another little trick with the before pseudo element to give the illusion that the top of the grid is cut off and thus the circles look like semi-circles. The pseudo element here is creating a 20px high block which has the same colour as the poster. It's got an absolute position and lays on top of the <code>circles-grid</code>.</p><p>The nested <code>circle</code> class is the base circle that will be used to generate a circle dynamically using JavaScript. The <code>white-circle</code> will be used as an override to colour the white circles on the poster.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>.circles-grid</span><span>

        <p>Firmware developers are generally accustomed to using logging for execution
information. On microcontrollers, this is usually done through a serial
interface attached to a terminal on the host.</p>

<p>But one might need more advanced features from the host! I was in this position
not long ago 🤨.</p>

<p>When working on camera firmware, and particularly on the image processing
algorithm, I constantly needed to transfer images from the camera to my host
machine to make sure everything was working fine. So I started using
semi-hosting! It has greatly facilitated not only my development but also the
debugging of my embedded software.</p>

<p><strong>Semihosting</strong> is one of the many interesting features available on ARM Cortex
microcontrollers. It allows an embedded program to take advantage of the
capabilities of an attached computer when the debugger is running.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>This post introduces semihosting and shows how to use it and integrate it into
your own embedded projects.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>



<h2 id="what-is-semihosting">What Is Semihosting</h2>

<p>According to ARM documentation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, <strong>semihosting</strong> is <em>a mechanism that enables
code running on an ARM target to communicate and use the Input/Output facilities
on a host computer that is running a debugger</em>.</p>

<p>In other words, an ARM based MCU can run C library functions, such as
<code>printf()</code>, <code>scanf</code>, or even <code>fopen</code>, and have these interact directly with the
host computer attached to the device. By doing so, it can benefit from the
screen, the keyboard, or the disk of the host.</p>

<p>
  <img width="600" src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/semihosting/semihosting_overview.png">
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>This is done by halting the CPU target by the debugger agent, either by running
into a breakpoint instruction (<code>BKPT 0xAB</code>  for ARMv6-M or ARMv7-M) or by
sending a supervisor call instruction (<code>SVC 0xAB</code> or <code>SVC 0x123456</code>) depending
on the target architecture or processor.</p>

<p>This indicates to the host that the target is requesting a semihosting
operation.</p>

<p>The debugger agent then figures out the operation requested by the target by
reading the content of <code>r0</code>, and, if necessary, accesses all other function
parameters pointed by <code>r1</code>.</p>

<p>While the CPU is still halted, the host will execute the requested operation and
return the result in <code>r0</code> before allowing the processor to continue running its
program.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the semihosting operations defined by ARM<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* File operations */</span>
<span>SYS_OPEN</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x01</span> <span>//Open a file or stream on the host system.</span>
<span>SYS_ISTTY</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x09</span> <span>//Check whether a file handle is associated with a file or a stream/terminal such as stdout.</span>
<span>SYS_WRITE</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x05</span> <span>//Write to a file or stream.</span>
<span>SYS_READ</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x06</span> <span>//Read from a file at the current cursor position.</span>
<span>SYS_CLOSE</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x02</span> <span>//Closes a file on the host which has been opened by SYS_OPEN.</span>
<span>SYS_FLEN</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0C</span> <span>//Get the length of a file.</span>
<span>SYS_SEEK</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0A</span> <span>//Set the file cursor to a given position in a file.</span>
<span>SYS_TMPNAM</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0D</span> <span>//Get a temporary absolute file path to create a temporary file.</span>
<span>SYS_REMOVE</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0E</span> <span>//Remove a file on the host system. Possibly insecure!</span>
<span>SYS_RENAME</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x0F</span> <span>//Rename a file on the host system. Possibly insecure!</span>

<span>/* Terminal I/O operations */</span>
<span>SYS_WRITEC</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x03</span> <span>//Write one character to the debug terminal.</span>
<span>SYS_WRITE0</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x04</span> <span>//Write a 0-terminated string to the debug terminal.</span>
<span>SYS_READC</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x07</span> <span>//Read one character from the debug terminal.</span>

<span>/* Time operations */</span>
<span>SYS_CLOCK</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x10</span>
<span>SYS_ELAPSED</span>     <span>EQU</span> <span>0x30</span>
<span>SYS_TICKFREQ</span>    <span>EQU</span> <span>0x31</span>
<span>SYS_TIME</span>        <span>EQU</span> <span>0x11</span>

<span>/* System/Misc. operations */</span>
<span>SYS_ERRNO</span>       <span>EQU</span> <span>0x13</span> <span>//Returns the value of the C library errno variable that is associated with the semihosting implementation.</span>
<span>SYS_GET_CMDLINE</span> <span>EQU</span> <span>0x15</span> <span>//Get commandline parameters for the application to run with (argc and argv for main())</span>
<span>SYS_HEAPINFO</span>    <span>EQU</span> <span>0x16</span>
<span>SYS_ISERROR</span>     <span>EQU</span> <span>0x08</span>
<span>SYS_SYSTEM</span>      <span>EQU</span> <span>0x12</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to Use It</h2>

<p>In this example, I run the program on an STM32 and use the <code>arm-none-eabi</code>
toolchain along with <strong>openOCD</strong> <code>gdbserver</code>. Other tools may be used instead
depending on your hardware, for more details on which debug interface to use, it
would be wise to read <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Once you are all set, we can start coding.</p>

<p>First, to enable semihosting, you need to link:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<code>libc.a</code>, the standard C library (<em>newlib</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> for <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code>),</li>
  <li>and <code>librdimon.a</code>, a part of the <em>libgloss</em><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> library (for platform-specific
code) to your project.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is done by adding a few options to the ARM linker:</p>
<ul>
  <li>removing <code>-nostartfiles</code> flag to allow linking standards libraries,</li>
  <li>adding <code>-lc -lrdimon</code> flags,</li>
  <li>and changing the <em>spec strings</em> file<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> to <code>--specs=rdimon.specs</code> to use the
semihosted version of the <em>syscalls</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point essentially means that the system calls can be used when a
debugger is attached (note that the CPU may crash if a debugger is not present).</p>

<p>Now on the C code side, you need to call <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code> before
starting a semihosting operation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>initialise_monitor_handles</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span>  	<span>initialise_monitor_handles</span><span>();</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
  	<span>// other tasks ...</span>

<span>#ifdef SEMIHOSTING
</span>    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
<span>#endif
</span>
    <span>// other tasks ...</span>

  	<span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are using <code>crt0</code> initialization function, <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code>
has already been called for you before <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, you can compile and program your microcontroller as
usual, however, once the microcontroller flashed it should be halted and not run
yet.</p>

<p>In my case, I launch <em>OpenOCD</em> <code>gdbserver</code> in one terminal, to flash, reset and
halt the CPU. And run <code>gdb</code> from another terminal to connect to the server, and
enable the semihosting in the server side<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>arm-none-eabi-gdb <span>-ex</span> <span>"target extended-remote localhost:3333"</span> <span>-ex</span> <span>"monitor reset halt"</span> <span>-ex</span> <span>"monitor arm semihosting enable"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>If <code>initialise_monitor_handles()</code> is called before enabling the semihosting in
the server, a <code>HardFault</code> may occur due to an unexpected debug event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once semihosting is enabled, you can run your program from <code>gdb</code>, and the
semihosting operation will be handled by the <code>gdbserver</code>.</p>

<p>Isn’t it great? 😋</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope it was fun reading this post, semihosting is not commonly used in
embedded development because it slows down the execution speed, but
nevertheless, it can be very handy in some cases.</p>

<p>I look forward to your remarks, tips, and comments.</p>

<p>I get the temptation to make standup asynchronous. “Stop forcing a daily meeting on everyone! Take back those <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">15 minutes</a>!” It sounds great, and I’m usually a fan of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/15/good-teams-are-noisy/">writing as a way to collaborate</a>. </p>



<p>But <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/02/09/say-things-that-can-be-wrong/">asynchronous standups are not standups</a>. They’re a way for teams to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/24/declare-bankruptcy-and-dont-be-ashamed-of-it/">kill standups</a> without feeling guilty about it. </p>



<p>Why? Two reasons:</p>



<p><strong>Reason 1: Standups are not status updates. </strong>I like Scrum’s definition of a standup, even for teams not doing Scrum:</p>



<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum">Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>See that? In a good standup, you’re <strong>re-<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">planning the sprint</a> every day</strong>. That can’t happen if you rattle off a quick “last 24 I did X, next 24 I’ll do Y, no blockers” and move on with your day.</p>



<p><strong>Reason 2: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">Nobody’s reading</a> all those updates.</strong> At best, the manager reads them and one or two other people skim them. That’s not collaboration. That’s reporting up the chain, which is not what standups are for.</p>



<p>If your <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">standups are so useless</a> that you don’t miss anything by taking it to Slack, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/17/zombie-standups-try-walking-the-board/">try fixing them</a> instead of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">giving up</a>. </p>

				<p>Imagine you are handed this device and asked to get root on it as quickly as possible. No further information is given. Where would you begin? &nbsp;<em>(If you just want to see the router get rooted, jump down to "Mounting an Attack: Rooting a Home Router" ;-)</em></p>    <p><em>Our target: A <strong>VERY</strong> common/popular consumer Access Point.</em></p>  <p>Since you have the device in your hands, you might try directly attacking the hardware. However, if you've never done any kind of hardware hacking, getting started can be intimidating. In this post, we are going to talk about the fundamental information you need to know to use JTAG for hacking hardware. We'll also go over a quick example to illustrate the power of direct hardware access. ​</p>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><strong>Why Do Manufacturers Use JTAG?</strong></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/boundary-scan-history.png?241" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p>​JTAG is a common hardware interface that provides your computer with a way to communicate directly with the chips on a board. It was originally developed by a consortium, the Joint (European) Test Access Group, in the mid-80s to address the increasing difficulty of testing printed circuit boards (PCBs). JTAG&nbsp;has been in widespread use ever since it was included in the Intel 80486 processor in 1990 and codified as IEEE 1491 that same year.&nbsp;Today JTAG is used for debugging, programming and testing on virtually ALL embedded devices.&nbsp;<br></p> <hr>    <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/dfx-dft-ictdi-img01.gif?264" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><p><strong>Boundary Scanning</strong><br>With the invention of integrated circuits came the need to test physical interconnects. That is: test whether "Point A" on a circuit board correctly connects to "Point C". As industry drove toward higher density interconnects and finer pitch (i.e. smaller) components, a standardized way of testing integrated circuits (or "chips") was needed. By embedding the test logic within the IC itself and limiting the physical interface to just a few signals, JTAG/boundary-scan presented an elegant solution to testing, debugging, and diagnosing modern electronic systems.&nbsp;Simply stated, boundary Scanning allows you to read and write individual bits, on individual pins, of the individual chips on a board. This ability to read and write 1's and 0's directly onto the pins is extremely powerful, but widely misunderstood.&nbsp;</p> <hr>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <p>​The JTAG interface gives manufacturers a way to test the physical connections between pins on a chip. When electrical engineers talk about using JTAG to "debug" a chip, they are talking about something very different than traditional software debugging. They are talking about making sure pin A on chip A is physically connected to pin B on chip B, and that all those pins are functioning correctly. Since JTAG gives you direct hardware access to a device, it's also a fantastic tool for security research.</p>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/connectiontest_orig.gif" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/connectiontest.gif?158" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <h2><u><span size="5" color="#3f3f3f"><span><strong>JTAG Fundamentals</strong></span></span></u></h2>  <p><span></span><span><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/654px-jtag-chain-svg_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"><img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/654px-jtag-chain-svg.png" alt="Picture"></a><span></span></span></p><div><p>Before we go into using JTAG to actually hack something, let's review the JTAG fundamentals.</p><p><strong>4 Pins, Plus 1</strong><br>The official JTAG standard requires 4 standard pins (or signals), and defines an optional 5th. These signals, and the small bit of silicon logic that connects and controls them, are collectively referred to as the Test Access Port, or TAP controller.</p></div> <hr>  <p><strong>The JTAG "Tower of Babel"</strong></p>  <div><p>One of the most confusing thing about learning to get hands-on with JTAG is how much partial and disinformation there is about it. Manufacturers' websites tell you the "theory" of how it works, but leave you longing for more information about "how to get started". To further confuse things there are other factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Buzzword</strong>:&nbsp;It is a infosec buzzword, everyone talks about it but few really share actionable info</li><li><strong>Loaded Word: </strong>JTAG has come to mean many things to many people. For example,&nbsp;in the gamer community "JTAG" means a hardware modification&nbsp;for a console that allows playing pirated games or loading homebrew content (i.e. "a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/10/20/freeboot-gives-the-xbox-360-jtag-hack-new-life/" target="_blank">jtagged&nbsp;XBox</a>"). This makes it difficult to search for useful information.</li><li><strong>Vernacular Overlap:</strong> As mentioned above, when an Electrical Engineer says "debug" he means: <em>"Are the pins in the right place?&nbsp;Is there enough power?&nbsp;Is the logic of the circuit correct?"</em> When a Software Engineer says "debug" he thinks of GDB or WinDBG. JTAG is designed for the former, not the latter.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Misunderstanding: </strong>As software developers the closest similarity&nbsp;to JTAG is maybe Kernel debugging via a debug cable (USB, Parallel, or Serial). But this is a dangerous comparison, because even on the "debugee" (in that scenario) there is software code executing on the remote system&nbsp;handling the translation of commands arriving on the debug cable. The JTAG state machine implemented&nbsp;entirely in hardware on the target.</li></ul></div>  <p><strong>What JTAG <u>ISN'T!</u></strong></p>  <div><p>In an effort to dispel disinformation (which is so rampant) here is what JTAG isn't.</p><ul><li><strong>The name of a specific device</strong> for debugging firmware or hardware</li><li><strong>The name of a piece of software</strong> used for debugging software code running on an embedded device.</li><li><strong>The name of a protocol:&nbsp;</strong>The JTAG specification doesnt even define the protocol for how data is passed between debugger and debugee (i.e. there is no .h file you can reference defining a "JTAG packet" to be passed over a serial, parallel, or USB cable to a target)</li><li><strong>The name of a kind of connector: </strong>Unlike a specification like USB or Ethernet, the&nbsp;JTAG specification doesn't even define what connectors should look like. This&nbsp;leads to a VERY confusing diversity of "JTAG" connectors. This is often a huge source of confusion&nbsp;to a software person. Imagine if every USB cable was different!</li></ul></div>  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-21-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-21-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>All of the connectors above can be referred to as "JTAG" connectors. </p> </div></div>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-15-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-15-am.png?329" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>JTAG connector for a DD WRT router</p> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						  <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-1-33-08-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>JTAG connector for a Point-Of-Sale device</p> </div></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <p>All of the connectors above are "JTAG" connectors. Why do they look so different? &nbsp;Where is the standardization? In practice, you can find hundreds or thousands of different looking "JTAG" connectors in devices. <strong>Why?</strong> Before we explain why, let's not talk about what it isn't and talk about what it is (according to the specification).</p>  <p><strong>What JTAG <u>IS</u>: The Five required JTAG Pins (or "Signals")&nbsp;</strong></p>  <div><p>Here is what JTAG is. In it's most fundamental. The JTAG specification 1149.1 requires these five signals:</p><ul><li><u><strong><span size="5">TCK</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>C</strong>loc<strong>k</strong><ul><li>The drummer, or metronome that dictates the speed of the TAP controller. Voltage on this pin simply pulses up and down in a rhythmic, steady beat. On every “beat” of the clock, the TAP controller takes a single action. The actual clock speed is not specified in the JTAG standard. The TAP controller accepts its speed from the outside device controlling JTAG.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><u><strong><span size="5">TMS</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>M</strong>ode <strong>S</strong>elect<ul><li>Voltages on the Mode Select pin control what action JTAG takes. By manipulating the voltage on this pin, you tell JTAG what you want it to do.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TDI</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>D</strong>ata-<strong>I</strong>n<ul><li>The pin that feeds data into the chip. The JTAG standard does not define protocols for communication over this pin. That is left up to the manufacturer. As far as JTAG is concerned, this pin is simply an ingress method for 1s and 0s to get into the chip. What the chip does with them is irrelevant to JTAG.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TDO</span></strong></u>: <strong>T</strong>est <strong>D</strong>ata-<strong>O</strong>ut<ul><li>The pin for data coming out of the chip. Like the Data-In pin, communication protocols are not defined by JTAG.</li></ul></li><li><u><strong><span size="5">TRST</span></strong></u>: &nbsp;<strong>T</strong>est <strong>R</strong>e<strong>s</strong>e<strong>t&nbsp;</strong><span>(Optional)</span><ul><li>This optional signal is used to reset JTAG to a known good state, we'll explain why this is optional in a few paragraphs.</li></ul></li></ul></div>  <p>Now that we know what pins/signals are really defined as "JTAG" let's take a second look at the sample of connectors from above:</p>  <div><div> <p><a href="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-26-am_orig.png" rel="lightbox" onclick="if (!lightboxLoaded) return false"> <img src="https://blog.senr.io/uploads/2/4/4/8/24485815/screen-shot-2016-09-21-at-12-18-26-am_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p><p>Ah hah! We now see that each of these connectors have JTAG related signals!</p> </div></div>  <p><span>We now see that what <strong>makes these connectors "JTAG" is not their pin configurations,</strong> but rather the mere presence of these JTAG signals. It is with these signals that we can manipulate and communicate with the State Machine of a target device via it's "Test Access Port" (or TAP) controller embedded in its silicon.</span></p>  <blockquote>...the JTAG State Machine is so simple that you can <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/08/31/learn-jtag-by-writing-a-bit-banging-programmer/" target="_blank">write Arduino code to "bit-bang" interface with it...</a></blockquote>  <p>​<strong>The JTAG State Machine</strong><br>The JTAG specification IEEE 1149.1 specifies not only the signals but how the "State Machine" embedded in the TAP Controller of a device must behave. The State controller diagram is in the upper left of the video below. By manipulating the voltage on the TMS pin of the TAP controller and the TCK pin, you control the way the State Machine changes state. On each beat of the clock, the JTAG TAP controller in your targeted device checks if there is voltage on the TMS pin, and interprets that as either a 1 (voltage) or a 0 (no voltage). This series of 1’s and 0’s moves JTAG through a relatively simple State Machine. This state machine is so simple that you can <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/08/31/learn-jtag-by-writing-a-bit-banging-programmer/" target="_blank">even write Arduino code to manipulate it</a>. The value of the TMS pin needed to change state is denoted with a tiny "1" or "0" in the state machine diagram. You can see the operation of the state machine in the animation below</p>    <p><em><span size="2">The JTAG State Machine in operation. (A very simplified representation.) In reality, the signal sampling is slightly different (sampling of signals happening on the rising or the falling edge, differently). Also the "clock signal" visualization above is slightly buggy in that there is <strong>only</strong> one State Machine operation per clock cycle. Sampling happens with each Clock cycle.)</span></em></p>  <div><div><div> 	<table> 		<tbody> 			<tr> 				<td> 					 						  <div><p>Note that data is read into and out of the TDI and TDO pins while the state machine is in the Shift-IR or Shift-DR states. &nbsp;The specific differences between these states, and the registers they utilize are beyond the scope of this article. Suffice to say that IR (Instruction Register) and DR (Data Register) are like function calls. The value in IR is the "function" and the value in DR is the "argument". The JTAG specification doesn't define what the "functions" should be, that's up to the manufacturer.</p></div>   					 				</td>				<td> 					 						    <p>Animation of the JTAG TAP controller "Train Station".
