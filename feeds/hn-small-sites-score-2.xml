    <p>
      SymQEMU: Compilation-based symbolic execution for binaries
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS 2021),
    San Diego, CA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug
      detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed
      flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic
      execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a
      novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries
      (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on
      top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target
      program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables
      SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap
      the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture
      independence.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it
      outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM
      with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better
      performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a
      previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library,
      demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is a fast symbolic execution engine for binaries. On this page, we
    provide its source code, the raw results of the experiments described in the
    paper, and instructions how you can replicate those experiments yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymQEMU is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symqemu">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe three sets of experiments: we first benchmark
    SymQEMU with Google FuzzBench, then we run it on real-world software, and
    finally we perform a benchmark comparison during concolic execution of fixed
    paths. This section describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides
    links to our results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        FuzzBench (see the <a href="http://s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/2020-05-24-symqemu.zip">report</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We will share our integration scripts shortly; they're being cleaned up
        to obtain SymQEMU and its dependencies from the new public repository.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of real-world software we used the same setup as in the
        <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/symcc.html">evaluation of SymCC</a>. The binaries for SymQEMU,
        QSYM and S2E were plain builds without any instrumentation. SymQEMU was
        run via SymCC's fuzzing helper by prefixing the target command
        with <tt>/path/to/symqemu-x86_64</tt>. For the S2E analysis, we created
        a default project, then enabled the <tt>FunctionModels</tt> plugin and
        activated the option <tt>generateOnStateFork</tt> in
        the <tt>TestCaseGenerator</tt> plugin; coverage was evaluated
        with <tt>afl-showmap</tt> at the end of the analysis, using the same
        AFL-instrumented binaries as with the hybrid fuzzers.

      </p>

      <p>
        After the analysis of real-world software described above, we randomly
        collected 1,000 generated test cases per open-source target. We ran
        SymQEMU, QSYM and SymCC on each of those inputs, recording the time
        spent in execution and SMT solving, respectively, as per the logging
        output from the QSYM backend.

<![CDATA[Tailscale on NixOS: A New Minecraft Server in Ten Minutes]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[

<br/>
January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Automatic connection to Tailscale"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># make sure tailscale is running before trying to connect to tailscale</span>
    <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wants</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wantedBy</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"multi-user.target"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># set this service as a oneshot job</span>
    <span>serviceConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"oneshot"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># have the job run this shell script</span>
    <span>script</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>''
</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2
</span><span>
</span><span>      # check if we are already authenticated to tailscale
</span><span>      status="$(</span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale status -json | </span><span>${</span><span>jq</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/jq -r .BackendState)"
</span><span>      if [ $status = "Running" ]; then # if so, then do nothing
</span><span>        exit 0
</span><span>      fi
</span><span>
</span><span>      # otherwise authenticate with tailscale
</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eula</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span> <span># set to true if you agree to Mojang's EULA: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</span>
    <span>declarative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># see here for more info: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#server.properties</span>

      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>

  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

			<p>The world is becoming more and more aware of privacy and concerns around it. We are trying to limit sharing our personal information online, but how often are we protecting one of our most private information: <strong>our legal address</strong>?</p>

<h3 id="your-address-is-private">Your address is Private</h3>
<p>Think about it, how often do you share your legal address in the world?</p>

<p>From online shopping, to delivery like food, grocery or selling second hand goods in marketplace… how many entities did you share your address with in the last one year? My bad, one year is too long. How about last one month?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your address information is personally identifiable information (Private Information), and shouldn’t be accessible by entities who don’t really need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Your legal address is Private information.</em>
</center>


<p>From group chats, to online portals; from free signups to lucky draws; from resumes to job applications; from facebook marketplace to craigslist we keep sharing our address with strangers on untrusted platforms.</p>

<p>We consistently hear news about data leaks from poorly coded applications that exposed your address to malicious actors. Many online applications sell your legal address information to third parties for profit, or worse knowingly for the purpose of spam, phishing or hijacking your identity online or in the real world.</p>

<p>Despite this, we never we ask ourselves, why are we sharing the most private information with everyone?</p>

<p>Well, the reason is simple: there hasn’t been a platform until now which allowed users to <strong>“create addresses”</strong>. This is a new concept that most of us never thought of, but subconsciously have always wished it existed.</p>

  <p>The concept of “creating a personal address” is something most of us have never thought of, but subconsciously wished it existed.</p>

<p>Point addresses are not legal addresses. They are mapping to a Point in the world named by you. You can create as many Point Addresses as you may want instantly.</p>

<p>You can call the location where you want deliveries as <strong>·happy-home-us·</strong> or <strong>·delivery2me-us·</strong> or anything else of your choice, and Point it precisely to the location in the real world with description and photos if you wish to add.</p>

<em><b><a href="https://pnt.is/delivery2me-us" target="_blank">·delivery2me-us·</a></b> Point Address I just created</em>
</center>


<p>When you create a Point Address, you have complete control over it. From updating the Point itself such as changing its name, updating Point’s location, to its visibility (Public or Private), you have full control over your Point Address.</p>

<h3 id="private-protected-and-public-points">Private, Protected and Public Points</h3>
<p>With Point, you can mark your addresses one of the three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: The Point Address is only available to you, and nobody else.</li>
  <li><strong>Protected</strong>: Only those people who know the Point Address, either via link, or by name can search for it in Point Search.</li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong>: Points that are Public show on Explore and can be found by anyone looking for Points in that area. Good example of the Public points are to allow Business and Service Providers to share their location with people looking for the services.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="point-is-available-everywhere">Point is available everywhere</h3>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re in US, Japan or India. You can use Point Address anywhere, anytime for anyone.</p>

<p>It is our endeavor to democratize addresses, and give the control of their location to the users themselves.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jack Ma resurfaced for the first time since Chinaâ€™s government began clamping down on his business empire nearly three months ago, appearing in a live-streamed video that sent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.â€™s stock soaring but left plenty of unanswered questions about the billionaireâ€™s fate.</p>

<p>Ma spoke briefly on Wednesday during an annual event he hosts to recognize rural teachers. In one video of the event circulated online, Chinaâ€™s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou. Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group Co., told the teachers heâ€™ll spend more time on philanthropy. He didnâ€™t mention his run-ins with Beijing.</p>

<p>Ant confirmed the authenticity of the video, first posted on an online blog, but declined to comment further. Shares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5 per cent in Hong Kong and were up almost the same level in pre-market U.S. trade.</p>

<p>Speculation about Maâ€™s whereabouts and his standing with President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government had reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba. Beijingâ€™s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he infamously rebuked â€œpawn shopâ€� Chinese lenders, regulators who donâ€™t get the internet, and the â€œold menâ€� of the global banking community.</p>

<p>Maâ€™s comments on Wednesday struck a much different tone, echoing themes espoused by the ruling Communist Party. A former English schoolteacher, he spoke about the importance of reviving Chinaâ€™s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.</p>

<p>â€œRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â€� Ma said during the event. â€œWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â€�</p>

<p>While Maâ€™s exact whereabouts remain unclear, his emergence in a public forum may help quell some of the more dire rumors about his fate in a country where media coverage is often tightly choreographed. Among the earliest outlets to report on his video address was an online news outlet backed by the Zhejiang provincial government.</p>

<p>Ma had kept out of public view since regulators in November scuttled Antâ€™s US$35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of weeks.</p>

<p>â€œJack Maâ€™s unexpected re-emergence -- just as sudden as his earlier disappearance -- is likely a sign that his relationship with Beijingâ€™s regulatory authorities has stabilized,â€� said Brock Silvers, a managing director at private equity fund Kaiyuan Capital in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>But Ma probably isnâ€™t out of the woods, Silvers added. â€œA path acceptable to all parties may have been identified, but Ant Group still looks likely to be dis-aggregated and regulatory restrictions will almost surely take a significant bite out of Antâ€™s former valuation.â€�</p>

<p>Jack Ma addressing teachers via livestream at an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural educators, Jan. 20.</p>

<p>The clampdown on Maâ€™s empire is part of a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>The government has increasingly sought to exert influence over the extent to which companies from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to ByteDance Ltd. amass data and direct commerce and media. The same month Antâ€™s IPO was scuttled, the nationâ€™s top antitrust watchdog published new guidelines warning tech giants against monopolistic practices from forced exclusive arrangements to collusion on data. While Ant and Alibaba have borne the brunt of that assault since November, investors have since sold off peers from Tencent to Meituan. Both stocks rallied more than 3 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

<p>While Alibabaâ€™s surge added about US$58 billion to the companyâ€™s market value, Maâ€™s standing with Beijing remains unclear. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Debate about his whereabouts arose because Beijing has in the past quietly detained billionaires that have run afoul of the law, without immediate trial.</p>

<p><strong>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says</strong></p>

<p>Jack Maâ€™s live-streamed appearance with rural teachers after keeping out of public view for more than two months may boost market sentiment on Alibaba and alleviate worst-case investor concerns. However, the monopoly probe launched in December by Chinaâ€™s State Administration for Market Regulation is yet to be resolved and may continue to weigh on the companyâ€™s future acquisitions and broader business practices.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many discussions around edge computing and its adoption scenarios. One of the key ingredients that could accelerate edge transformation is the ability to use an existing software stack for continuous deployment to the edge. We believe that a new type of hardware that can organically coexist with the cloud ecosystem could be a solution to address the challenge. For example, Turing Pi designed to be an edge computer with cloud-native hardware architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of processing data closer to the source isn’t new. Though, the opportunities that Kubernetes as well as machine learning open to it sound more promising than ever.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>It is doubtful that edge computing is going to replace the cloud. More likely, the edge is going to be an extension. That’s why the synergy of these two paradigms is empirical.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>Cloud computing has spawned many cloud-native solutions. Technologies like containers, serverless, Kubernetes changed the way developers build, deliver, and scale software. What all these technologies have in common is that they designed for distributed computing. The idea behind Turing Pi is a cluster of computers interconnected with Ethernet but all in one compact device. This architecture allows deploying and scaling software to the edge in the same way as in the cloud.&nbsp;</p><h4><em>The concept of a cluster board is similar to a PC motherboard but with an Ethernet network instead of a PCI bus. Rather than using just one processor, the cluster board can combine multiple processors and multiple types of processors. As an example, general-purpose compute modules can work in combination with machine learning modules. This heterogeneous approach could open a wider adaptation of machine learning applications at the edge.&nbsp;</em></h4><p>In other words, Turing Pi is a compact, energy-efficient, out of the box RACK system. These characteristics allow placing clusters in various locations, hard to reach places, and build things like mobile data centers. <a href="https://medium.com/@cfatechblog/edge-computing-at-chick-fil-a-7d67242675e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A striking example of cluster computing</a> adoption is the Chick-Fil-A restaurant chain. The company placed local Kubernetes clusters in more than two thousand restaurants. That helped Chick-Fil-A to build a resilient, highly available, internet-independent system. As a result, the company automated critical business processes and reduced public cloud load by processing data locally. The possibility of using cloud-native technologies at the edge helped Chick-Fil-A to accelerate innovations and get the code running in production as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Turing Pi V1 model is mostly aimed at developers, Devops and researchers. It is an amazing platform for learning and experimentation. The cluster board currently supports Raspberry Pi compute modules, which are intended for industrial applications. Raspberry Pi, by far, is the most popular single-board computer, and its colossal software ecosystem should help to lower entry points for new developers.&nbsp;Bare metal cluster using Raspberry Pis and running on Linux is not only affordable compared to what it can do, but can also be a great tool when dealing with resource-intensive tasks like compiling, continuous data parsing, or learning how to manage a cluster using real hardware instead of virtual machines. Also, it is very useful to have a personal Kubernetes cluster to explore concepts of distributed systems, create proof of concept prototypes, and deploy self-hosted services on-premises or at the edge with almost zero recurring costs.</p><p>Yes, we believe that compact clusters and edge computing is a great fit. Compact clusters could be great building blocks for edge infrastructure. It’s easy to scale within one mini cluster and within the whole fleet of clusters. Different cluster nodes intended for different type of applications, which is a more reliable and efficient way to run services. At the same time container orchestration tools like Kubernetes makes it easy to monitor, maintain and deliver software.</p></div></div>]]>

The company will retain its Canadian headquarters.</p>  <p>"This is the most important day in the history of the company and an incredible milestone," said Allen Lau, one of Wattpad's co-founders, in an interview.</p>  <p>"It is the beginning of a new chapter and using TV show terminology, this is episode one of season two, so I'm absolutely looking forward to this."</p>    <p>Lau and Ivan Yuen, who will continue to lead Wattpad following the sale, started the self-publishing platform after the pair dreamed up the idea on a napkin while waiting for a flight at the Vancouver airport food court in 2006.</p>  <p>Wattpad quickly became home to stories from dozens of genres because it allows anyone to share their writing for free and is accessible on phones and tablets.</p>  <p>It became a household name around 2013 when Anna Todd, a Texas woman, started writing <em>After</em>,&nbsp;a fanfiction series on the platform about One Direction singer Harry Styles.</p>  <p>Her stories were eventually made into books and a film series, which encouraged Wattpad to start book publishing and studio entertainment divisions.</p>  <p>However, Lau admitted a sale wasn't always his plan.</p>  <p>"We weren't actively looking for sellers, but we have been talking to investors along the way …&nbsp;to accelerate our growth," he said.</p>  <p>"We knew Naver for quite some time and we realized after some conversations we have a shared vision."</p>  <h2>Opportunity to grow, get into animation, co-founder says</h2>  <p>Naver, which bills itself as "South Korea's largest web search engine," was an ideal partner because it owns digital comics platform Webtoon, he said.</p>  <p>Webtoon is behind some of the biggest names in webcomics, including <em>Lore Olympus</em>,&nbsp;and has worked with the Jim Henson Company and producers behind hit films like <em>The Lego Movie</em>, the <em>It&nbsp;</em>franchise and <em>Snowpiercer</em>.</p>  <p>Lau said Naver will offer Wattpad a chance to get into animation and to grow beyond the 90 million users — including more than five million writers — that Wattpad has. Webtoon said it has more than 72 million monthly active users.</p>  <p>"Wattpad's vision to entertain and connect the world through stories fits perfectly with our vision for Webtoon and Naver's content brand and we're thrilled to have them join the Naver family," Seong-sook Han, chief executive, said in a statement.</p>    <p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of Wattpad's fiscal year and is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>  <p>It is the latest in a string of sales that have seen once-promising Canadian tech companies snatched up by foreign owners during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>Element AI, a Montreal-based firm that creates artificial intelligence solutions for large organizations, signed a deal in November to be purchased by ServiceNow, a Santa Clara, Calif., company that offers a cloud-based workflow technology.</p>  <p>San Francisco-based "buy now, pay later" company Affirm reached a deal to buy Toronto rival PayBright for $340 million in early December.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post started as a few simple sentences for my brother; tips on how to lose fat and manage blood sugar better. I decided to write them down as a reminder to myself, or anyone, especially those in middle age, as I’m starting the year with a health drive.</p>

<p>The golden triad is simple: <em>optimise your sleep, diet and activeness.</em></p>

<p>Consider this as 10 years of research simplified into a blog post. If knowledge was the answer we’d all be millionaires with six pack abs – lifestyle change is the only way.</p>

<p>Setting up for success: I recommend a few links throughout this, before reading I’d start with: <a href="https://youtu.be/qHUFgFYdJck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behaviour/Environment Design</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your diet is not only what you eat.</p>

  <p>It is what you watch, what you listen to, what you read, the people you hang around.</p>

  <p>Be mindful of the things you put into your body emotionally, spiritually and physically.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This one is fairly obvious, simply put, sleep restores body and mind, so try to improve your quality of sleep.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes we think we’re hungry when were really tired.</p>

<p>The book: Why We Sleep by Mathew Walker  <br>
The hack:  Try and sleep 8 hours every night, ideally at the same time, even on weekends. Don’t drink caffeine after midday. Avoid alcohol? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOaSWPROOxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five tips</a></p>


<p>I’ve always had success shedding a few pounds following the Slow Carb Diet; evolved or created by Tim Ferriss in The Four Hour Body. This is my go-to approach, as a bonus I also truly feel it’s <em>anti-inflammatory</em> effects.</p>

<p><em>I like it because at it’s core it’s about simplicity, no white food (bread/rice/pasta), no processed food (i.e. no sugar), so it really encourages you to eat home cooked <strong>whole foods</strong>.</em></p>

<p>There is a tonne of information online about what is involved:</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.williamhertling.com/2011/02/4-hour-body-fat-loss-cheat-sheet_27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheat sheet</a> or an <a href="http://www.fitnessinfographics.com/diets-4-hour-body-slow-carb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infograhic</a>.</p>

<p>I also believe in the health benefits of Time Restricted Feeding; due to a book called The Circadian Code, here’s an excellent intro/overview by the author: <a href="https://youtu.be/t0NI0jELuF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Satchin Panda - Daily Rythms</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lifestyle is what, WHEN and how much we Eat, Sleep, and Move on a daily basis.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My preference is to exercise/workout, or go for a walk, in the morning, before eating. I will drink water or black coffee, then tend to start eating around midday, I try not to eat at night (after 9:30). Meaning a 9-10 hour feeding window, giving my digestion a break. If an option, I would also swim and sauna in the evening.</p>

<p>I think calorie density/food satiety (feeling full) can play there parts (for example, eating enough so as not to snack, or starting meals with soups or veggies/salads): <a href="https://youtu.be/0CdwWliv7Hg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calorie Density: How To Eat More, Weigh Less and Live Longer</a></p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>whenever you break fast, start with a slow carb/high protein meal.</li>
  <li>Hydrate (2 litres water per day), don’t drink calories and have a day off (cheat day).</li>
  <li>Take pictures on your phone of everything you put in your mouth (for a week).</li>
  <li>Or log everything in myfitnesspal. (what gets measured gets managed).</li>
</ul>


<p>A complex and debatable topic, as there are many variables; types of exercise, what we can sustain/enjoy, our age, our ability to recover, etc.</p>

<p><em>For this goal, the idea is simple, do activities that keep our metabolism in fat burning mode</em>.</p>

<p>I believe we’re burning fat when in a calorie deficit (consuming less calories than we use). Muscle is denser/heavier than fat, building muscle means we use more calories to move, which means burning fat (our goal). Also, as we age we suffer from muscle atrophy (loss), so if we don’t build new muscle, we’re getting slowly weaker. “Use it or lose it, baby!”</p>

<p>As the saying goes, you can’t outrun a bad diet. Whilst running/swimming/cycling/yoga/pilates are great exercise for our health/heart/cardio, it isn’t the optimum way to burn fat, as they don’t build as much muscle.</p>

<p>Lifting weights, which also stimulates the heart and builds muscle, includes lifting our own bodyweight, so we can start with simple push-up/pull-ups, air squats, then perhaps progress to kettlebells/dumbbells. High Intensity Interval Training is an excellent way to kickstart the metabolism and continue fat burning for a few hours (some call it the afterburn effect), but this is probably true of many exercises.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a quick/light HIIT circuit/session using weights (time-lapse, 45 sec each exercise, 15 sec rest, x3 rounds): <a href="https://youtu.be/jdV_td3OJg4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIIT session</a></p>

<p>Also, walking is an excellent recovery tool, great to keep the fire going and burn calories…</p>

<p>Ideally, in time, we would combine compound strength training (e.g. squats/deadlifts, to stop muscle atrophy) with some weighted HIIT classes (2-3 x per week), then some other general recovery exercises throughout the week (like walking/swimming).</p>

<p>N.B. An important point to remember is to fuel our body correctly, to optimise the benefits of whatever type of training protocol we follow. I try to balance this a slow carb (25%), medium fat(40%), high protein(35%), if possible.</p>

<p>The hack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>do as many wall push-ups, pull-ups (start on a chair), air squats, just before and 90 mins after meals, as you can (consider <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?&amp;q=negative+pull+ups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">progressions</a>)</li>
  <li>Replace car journeys with walking or cycling (great for the bank balance too)</li>
</ul>


<p>Putting on fat doesn’t happen overnight, neither does fat loss, or composition changes. Consistency over the long term is the key.  If you crack and have a tasty treat, or a day off exercise, make sure to enjoy it and start over the next day. James Clear has an excellent mindset/approach “I try to never miss two in a row”.</p>

<p>It’s not all about what you put in your mouth, keep active, and sleep well. Remember, losing anything from 1-2 pounds of fat per week really is winning.</p>

<p>The book(s): The Slight Edge/Atomic Habits  <br>
The hack: Simple, small and satisfying daily positive choices that move you in the right direction. Picture yourself winning, try to track how often you are choosing to take that action/behaviour, and enjoy all the small wins.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein is reputed to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>And I’m still a fat b*st*rd</em>…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h3>An Engineer’s Guide to Enterprise-grade Single Sign-on<a href="#an-engineers-guide-to-enterprise-grade-single-sign-on" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>OAuth and <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/what-is-saml">SAML</a> are both open specifications for exchanging access credentials for a specific user between an identity provider and an application. When a user wants to sign in to an app using either SAML or OAuth, they are sent to a third party where the user must already be registered. They sign in to this third party, and get sent back to the application. The mechanisms differ, but both SAML and OAuth involve using secrets to securely exchange information about the user in order for the application to begin an authenticated session for the user.</p><p>If you’re approaching these technologies as an engineer, you can consider OAuth to be <em>class based</em> while SAML is <em>instance based</em>. With OAuth, you configure your application with a provider like GitHub, and any GitHub user can now sign in to your app. But with SAML, you must configure your application with an Identity Provider (IDP) <em>instance</em>. Each customer who wants to use SAML will have an instance with their IDP, and you and the customer must perform a configuration between your app and their IDP instance. </p><p>While this might seem like a small distinction for SAML vs. OAuth, as you pull on the instance thread, you begin to understand implementing SAML to be a much bigger project than implementing OAuth - it needs CRUD and persistence, a UI to configure instances, and documentation for your customers and teammates, and you’ll need to adjust how your sign-in form works. These knock on effects are way more important to think about than the nitty gritty details of SAML — like most things in modern web dev, really strong libraries exist for the nitty gritty, but they only get you 90% of the way there when building a production-ready integration.</p><h3>An abridged and personal history of OAuth<a href="#an-abridged-and-personal-history-of-oauth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>I started programming for the web right in the midst of the “social web 2.0” era and OAuth was <em>everywhere</em>. It was the heyday of hackathons, a more fun and flippant wacky Internet, where OAuth both helped you get up and running quicker, bypassing password based auth, and also gave you a wealth of users’ data to mix and match and create experiences with - Facebook friends, Foursquare checkins and Tweets…at least when the fail whale was kept at bay.</p><p>OAuth was convenient for the average web user. It wasn’t necessarily designed as a way to authenticate your users, but folks started using it that way and never really looked back. Instead of remembering passwords for hundreds of websites, the average Internet user was happy to hand over keys to their Facebook account for the convenience of signing in with Facebook. Providers, consumer engineers and users eventually got smarter with scopes, limiting what an app could do on your behalf in the account you had OAuthed.</p><p>OAuth remains a popular authentication mechanism today, for both consumer and business applications. It’s incredibly easy to implement - languages and frameworks often have standardized approaches or libraries that make this easier. In Ruby, there’s <a href="https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">omniauth</a>, “a library that standardizes multi-provider authentication for web applications”. Any developer can create an omniauth “strategy” for a specific web service. Passport is a similar approach for NodeJS apps.</p><p>You’ll typically register your application on the web service’s developer portal, where you’ll get a Client ID and Client Secret, specify redirect URIs and choose the scopes you want to use. Add these secrets to your application, drop in an OAuth library, and you’re done in less than an hour. OAuth is definitely convenient for users and engineers, but when it comes to large or security-focused enterprises, SAML is the best choice for them and their employees (even if it’s a headache to implement).</p><h3>Keeping CISOs up at night<a href="#keeping-cisos-up-at-night" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>A Chief Information Security Officer is the person ultimately responsible for an organization's information and data security. A good way to shirk this responsibility would be to allow your employees to sign up for critical apps and services using a password or through OAuth against an identity provider that the enterprise doesn’t control. Consider an employee who is terminated, but signed in to all of their services using email and password or their personal Twitter account. </p><p>The IT department would need to ensure, right at the time of termination, that the employee’s access to services is cut off. They would need to go into the account settings for every service and remove that user. At enterprise scale, tens or hundreds of employees might leave in a given week. Managing account access would be a never-ending nightmare for the IT department.</p><h3>SAML locks it down<a href="#saml-locks-it-down" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once again the SAML part is not really what matters here. Many IDPs support other technologies for exchanging credentials, including OAuth. But SAML is the standard that enterprises have adopted and is supported by every enterprise-grade Identity Provider. </p><p>The important aspect of enterprise-grade Identity Providers is that they centralize user access to applications. When an employee is terminated, the IT department can go to just one place where they remove the user, and the user immediately loses access to all of the services they used at work. SAML stands for “Secure Assertion Markup Language”, but in common usage, SAML is an authentication mechanism where an enterprise can easily shut off access. When an enterprise requires that you offer SAML authentication, it’s not because they love old clunky technologies or want to annoy you — they simply need to be able to manage employee access to services in a single place.</p><h3>SAML slows you down<a href="#saml-slows-you-down" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you need to add SAML, that’s a great problem for your company to have! It means you’re moving up market and selling to bigger companies with a larger deal size and who tend to be a little stickier. If you’re thinking about adding SAML, you probably have 1,000 other things on your plate, from scaling concerns, to features you’ve wanted to add, and tech debt to address. But adding SAML might be the biggest single thing you could do to increase your company’s revenue, unlocking deals with bigger companies.</p><p>The problem is that it takes <em>a lot more work</em> to implement SAML vs. OAuth. It’s not exactly difficult work - you won’t need to write any algorithms, and lots of open source libraries exist for dealing with the actual SAML responses you receive from an IDP. But returning to our <em>class</em> vs. <em>instance</em> based distinction, lets review some tasks you’ll need to complete in order to ship a production-ready SAML integration.</p><h4>1. Configuration UI and CRUD<a href="#1-configuration-ui-and-crud" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Every SAML-needing customer will need to be onboarded, where a teammate will provide some information to your customer, like an Assertion Consumer Service URL and an Entity ID. These are part of the SAML spec, and going into detail about their functions is beyond the scope of this post, but know that your application will need to generate these values, unique to each customer. Once your customer configures your app in their IDP, they’ll return some data to you, often in the form of a metadata XML file. Will you parse this for the keys and SSO URL you need to persist? Or have your teammates open the XML and copy out the data? Either way you’ll need to persist it all in a database table, and have a reliable way to look it up when a user wants to log in.</p><h4>2. Documentation<a href="#2-documentation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>You can’t assume that your customer will know how to set up a SAML app in their IDP instance, so you’ll need to provide some instructions. That typically means signing up for all of the common IDPs, working your way through their documentation and configuring a test app, QAing with your codebase, and ultimately creating some sort of documentation to help your customers. Skip this at your peril - this will be the first thing your valuable enterprise customer experiences after signing a deal. </p><h4>3. Sign-in UX<a href="#3-sign-in-ux" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Since SAML authentication is instance based, you need to route users to the right IDP via the SSO URL your customer returned to you. Unlike OAuth, you can’t just stick a Sign in With Okta button on your login page and be done. The two common ways of approaching this are to either split your login form into two steps, first ascertaining email and sending to the IDP if the user belongs to an enterprise SAML account, or to create a second SAML SSO login form that only collects email or company domain.</p><p>That’s a lot of work! If you’re reading this, I think we can probably assume that your teammates in support don’t know what SAML is, so you’ll probably need some internal docs and training too. And we haven’t even gotten into the SAML spec itself! Attribute mapping, Single Log Out, there’s still more to think about here.</p><h3>Osso lets you treat SAML as OAuth<a href="#osso-lets-you-treat-saml-as-oauth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>You’ve probably implemented OAuth at some point in your career, you may even have it in your current stack already for things like signing in with Google. It’s simple to set up - register your client, allow-list some redirect URIs and grab a Client ID and Secret. SAML on the other hand, while conceptually similar, requires configuration per customer instance, which makes a SAML integration a bit heavier of a lift. </p><p>​<a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/1-0-0-release-candidate">Osso</a> allows you to sign SAML users in using an OAuth flow - it's SAML as OAuth instead of SAML vs. OAuth. Osso handles everything SAML - our Admin UI is easy for non-technical teammates to use in order to onboard customers and generates custom documentation for your customer’s Identity Provider. When your customer returns an XML metadata file to you, your teammates can easily upload it, where the required values get parsed out and persisted. Osso provides libraries for omniauth and Passport, making your integration even easier. You can even keep your sign in UX the same - Osso offers a hosted login page so you can just add a “Sign in with SSO” button or link (though we do recommend eventually deepening your integration by sending a user to Osso with a domain or email for IDP routing). </p></section></div>]]>

<p>In 1966, a young woman drowned in the Ropers Motel pool in Pecos, Texas and for more than 50 years her true identity was unknown. The young woman, known until recently as Pecos Jane Doe, checked into the Ropers Motel with an unknown male companion, using the names, Mr. and Mrs. Russell Battoun. Hours later, a hotel employee found the woman’s body in the hotel pool. As the woman was being taken away in an ambulance, her companion checked out of the hotel and was never seen again.</p>

<p>More than 50 years later, Pecos Police Department Chief Lisa Tarango, continued the search for Pecos Jane Doe’s true identity. The victim is buried with a gravestone marked, "Unknown Girl Drowned July 5, 1966" and agency officials have continued to visit her grave and bring flowers.&nbsp;Pecos PD worked with NamUs to collect dental and anthropological information, as well as to do the inital STR testing. </p>

<p>Othram reached out to the Pecos Police Department in early 2020 to help identify the woman using advanced DNA testing. The laboratory work was funded mostly by Pecos Police Department, with a supplementary crowdfund established through DNASolves. Skeletal remains were brought to Othram in August 2020 and work on the case began, first to develop a DNA extract from the bone, and then to construct a DNA profile using Forensic-Grade Genome Sequencing®. </p>

<p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provided support and resources to faciliate an identification. First, NCMEC had produced an artistic sketch of what the woman might have looked like. Later, after successful DNA testing, they coordinated the genealogical research, securing the services of Innovative Forensic, who generously donated the time and resources to work family trees and produce a candidate lead. Pecos Police Department confirmed the lead through DNA testing of a close relative, confirming the identity of Pecos Jane Doe as Jolaine Hemmy. </p>

<p>Jolaine was 17 years old in 1966, working at a drive-in diner in Kansas City, Kansas. She abruptly vanished one day and didn't pick up her last paycheck. Her family reported her missing and worked hard to find out where she had gone and despite tremendous efforts by family and law enforcement, they were unable to find her. At least one family member remembers a man that took particular interest in Jolaine around the time of her disappearance, but little is known about him. Pecos Police Department is continuing to investigate. If anyone has information about Jolaine Hemmy, her disappearance, or the man that she was last seen with, please contact the Pecos Police Department at 432-445-4911 attention Cpl. Felix Salcido. </p>

January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>
  <span>systemd</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale-autoconnect</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Automatic connection to Tailscale"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># make sure tailscale is running before trying to connect to tailscale</span>
    <span>after</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wants</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"network-pre.target"</span> <span>"tailscale.service"</span> <span>];</span>
    <span>wantedBy</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"multi-user.target"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># set this service as a oneshot job</span>
    <span>serviceConfig</span><span>.</span><span>Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"oneshot"</span><span>;</span>

    <span># have the job run this shell script</span>
    <span>script</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>''
</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2
</span><span>
</span><span>      # check if we are already authenticated to tailscale
</span><span>      status="$(</span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale status -json | </span><span>${</span><span>jq</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/jq -r .BackendState)"
</span><span>      if [ $status = "Running" ]; then # if so, then do nothing
</span><span>        exit 0
</span><span>      fi
</span><span>
</span><span>      # otherwise authenticate with tailscale
</span><span>      </span><span>${</span><span>tailscale</span><span>}</span><span>/bin/tailscale up -authkey tskey-examplekeyhere
</span><span>    ''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow you to SSH in over the public internet</span>
    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
    <span>eula</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span> <span># set to true if you agree to Mojang's EULA: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</span>
    <span>declarative</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># see here for more info: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties#server.properties</span>
    <span>serverProperties</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>server-port</span> <span>=</span> <span>25565</span><span>;</span>
      <span>gamemode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"survival"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>motd</span> <span>=</span> <span>"NixOS Minecraft server on Tailscale!"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>max-players</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
      <span>enable-rcon</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span># This password can be used to administer your minecraft server.</span>
      <span># Exact details as to how will be explained later. If you want</span>
      <span># you can replace this with another password.</span>
      <span>"rcon.password"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"hunter2"</span><span>;</span>
      <span>level-seed</span> <span>=</span> <span>"10292992"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>

  <span># enable closed source packages such as the minecraft server</span>
  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

      <p>A few days ago, I gained admin access to the <abbr title="Enterprise resource planning">ERP</abbr> system of a German-based international online retailer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> operating a number of e-commerce websites. The ERP system included sensitive employee data, customer data, and over 160k invoices. They quickly addressed the issues and the overall communication went very well.</p>

<p>When I noticed that <code>https://███████24.de/.git/config</code> returned an actual git config file, I started investigating further. The file content itself only revealed the repository URL, which wasn’t publicly accessible. But the mere fact that the file was accessible gave away that the <code>.git</code> directory was not properly secured on the web server.</p>

<p>The <code>.git</code> directory exists in every git repository and contains all its information, including branches, commit history, etc. With access to the files within this directory, all that information can be downloaded piece by piece, for example using tools like <a href="https://github.com/liamg/gitjacker">gitjacker</a>. Directory listing on the web server is not required for this to work.</p>

<p>After restoring the downloaded git repository to a somewhat usable state, I had access to most of the repositories files and history and started looking around. The first thing I noticed were temporary files and backup files that shouldn’t have existed inside the webroot anyway, but were additionally added to the repository – perhaps by an incautious <code>git add .</code></p>

<p>I moved on loooking through files and found some <code>.json</code> configuration files in the repository that contained credentials:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "...": {
    "url": "http://█████████████████████████████",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "123secret███",
    "database": "█████████████████████",
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even worse, the files being <code>.json</code> files, their content was – unlike <code>.php</code> files – publicly accessible from the web server, without even requiring any access to the git repository.</p>

<p><img src="https://jomo.tv/img/uos_erp_login.png#right" alt="ERP admin login"> The URL led to the company’s web based ERP system where I could simply log in with a web browser using the credentials from the JSON files.</p>

<p><img src="https://jomo.tv/img/uos_erp_menu.png" alt="The ERP system's menu bar" title="The ERP system's menu bar"></p>

<p>This gave me access to <em>a lot</em> of data and functionality, most of which was <abbr title="Personally identifiable information">PII</abbr> or company secrets. Some of these were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email messaging</li>
  <li>Employee’s calendars, including private data such as medical appointments, birthday parties, etc.</li>
  <li>Employee’s paid and unpaid leave requests, leave reason and approval status</li>
  <li>Internal issue tracker</li>
  <li>Warehouse / Inventory details</li>
  <li>Cost price and public price of products</li>
  <li>Over 160k customer invoices</li>
</ul>

<p>As I was logged in as admin, it was also possible to <strong>create</strong>, <strong>modify</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> any or all of this information. (I did not try this)</p>

<p>Due to the large amount of customer data being at risk, I notified the retailer that same night. They replied the next day, were thankful and addressed the security issues in a quick and responsible manner, which I find quite noteworthy. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Accidentally exposed .git directories are very common, but they remain an oversight like any other. It is hard to prevent all oversights from happening. However, storing credentials in (supposedly private) source code is much more negligent and can be easily avoided. In this case, it led to a much worse outcome of a comparatively harmless issue. Website operators should be careful not to include files in the webroot that shouldn’t be publicly accessible, or ensure the web server is properly configured to deny access to them.</p>

<p>To prevent credentials in your source code, you can replace sensitive data with environment variables, or you can place configuration files outside your repository and webroot.</p>

  </p>
  
  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Corminaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore. To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue (for example from <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a>) is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. Either way, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and be bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moderna has a proprietary molecule called Lipid SM-102. Or maybe it isn’t that proprietary, because it might be covered by a patent owned by Arbutus Biopharma.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Moderna’s <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/sites/default/files/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf">Phase 3 Clinical Study Protocol</a> defines it as “heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl) (6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate” and calls it a “proprietary …</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

I first encountered the Foonly F1 when I went to work for Omnibus Computer Graphics in 1984.
Omnibus had just purchased the system from Triple-I (Information International Inc.) in
Culver City, CA.  Omnibus had big plans to make movies with computers, and the F1 had
been used in making TRON and numerous other high resolution film projects.  Omnibus was
a Canadian company, based in Toronto, and had recently done gone public.  They had big
plans to open offices in Hollywood and New York City and be the first big digital animation
company in the film business.  Omnibus president, John Pennie saw the F1 as a machine 
with a proven track record.  When I first had a look at it, I saw it as a disaster!  It was a fascinating R&amp;D project, but was never really designed to have the support, spares, and expertise needed to keep it up and running in a serious production environment.
<p>
The F1 was originally built by Triple-I in hopes of getting a large contract
with the Government for an Optical Character Recognition system.
Its design was done by some graduate students (Stanford?) named Poole, Pettit, Holloway, and Dyer (?).
As I understand it, their design became the DEC KL-10, but I could have that wrong.
The CPU was built on five wire-wrap pages, that were machine wrapped.
</p><p>
The design was done using one of the first CAD systems I had seen, (SUDS?) which I believe ran
on a PDP-15 clone that Triple-I used in its PFR-80, which was originally intended to be a film recorder.
The PFR had a vector-tube graphics display, and the user could graphically connect various
logic elements from libraries and have wire-wrap lists generated for machine wrapping.
The PFR, incidentally, was the reason the F1 became a film-maker. 
Triple-I had figured out how to get a smaller, better controlled spot out of a CRT than
anybody else at the time, and used that technology to print film for newspaper pages.
</p><p>
<i>Author's Note: I have several of the high-rez CRTs used in the III film printers, if anybody is interested in them, please contact me, (dave (at) zfx.com).</i>
</p><p>
The F1 had a bizzarre bus interface to the PFR that allowed it to dump high resolution
imagery to the PFR and have it print to a standard 35mm camera.  The images were
send in Red, Blue, and Green records and exposed through Wratten filters onto Kodak 5247 color negative film.
Another PFR note, someone at Triple-I had programmed a simple graphics game to run on
the PDP-15 and the vector tube.  You used front-panel dials and buttons to control
acceleration and rotation vectors for spaceships that could shoot particles at each
other.  I'm not sure of the exact origin of this program, but I believe it was
the first interactive vector graphics game, which ultimately gave rise to a group of
vector-displayed videogames in the mid-eighties.
</p><p>
The F1 had enough in common with "standard" DEC-10 peripherals that it could use
a disk channel controller( RH-10?).  This was attached to  three RP-04 (~50MB) disk drives,
one for the system, and two striped together to hold a total of two high-res images.
One would be computed and saved as separate RGB files, while the previous one was
being printed on the PFR.  The F1 had a huge Ampex core memory unit that I believe
held 256K 36-bit words.  That turned out to be barely enough to do high-resolution
computer graphics, so Triple-I had built the MMM, Movie Machine Memory, which
was built out of 4K static RAM chips.  The memory was organized so that it could
be displayed as an RGB image at 1024 x 1024 on a raster high-resolution monitor.
In that mode, the MMM held 6 bits per color, 18-bits per pixel.  It could also
be used as a bulk 512K word memory for the TRANEW graphics rendering program, which 
used it to store hash tables.  It was fascinating to "watch" the program execute
on the MMM monitor.
</p><p>
<i>I actually have one of the MMM memory boards.... somewhere in my junk pile.</i>
</p><p>
The F1 required a DEC KA-10 as a "console processor".
Since it was a development machine, the console was used to load and run the
microcode.  It was also an important debugging tool when (not if!) the system
did something screwy.  There was a modem attached to the KA-10, and in an
emergency, Dave Poole could usually be persuaded to dial into it and run diagnostics.
Of course, the console machine had its own disk controllers, disks, tape drives,
even a line printer, and it ended up holding user accounts and acting as general
non-job user disk storage.  The KA-10 itself booted from punched paper tape, so
a cold-start for the entire system was quite a journey up from ground zero!
</p><p>
When the F1 was up, it probably ran at something like 6 MIPS.  That seems really
slow by today's standard, but the code had been highly optimized.  The original
Fortran program, TRANEW had been written by Gary Demos  with help from Jim Blinn,
the JPL guy that did the pioneering computer-generated fly-by animations for NASA.
They had optimized inner loops in assembly code, and had removed every last bit
of "extraneous" code from the operating system, TOPS-10.  It was really more like
Swiss Cheese than an OS.
</p><p>
A second PFR unit acted as an "encoding station", and was attached to a huge Calcomp
digitizing tablet.  External vector displays had been added, as had another puck,
so that the operator could digitize from engineering-type drawings to build a
3D database for the objects used in the animations.  There were some fairly
sophisticated programs for extruding solids, sweeping shapes through 3D paths,
and other wonders, all executing on a PDP-15!
</p><p>
So when I arrived and saw this system in operation, my initial awe for the amount
of pioneering work that had gone into making the system do all the things it had
done quickly turned into a sense of dread given the tasks I had before me, which
were to: (1) re-assemble enough of the original team-members that had used the
system to be able to do feature film production, (2) learn how the system functioned
so that it could be maintained and kept working on a grueling production schedule,
(3) attempt to find areas where its performance or reliability could be improved,
(4) MOVE the system to new facilities that were being built at Paramount Studios,
and (5) stay sane!
</p><p>
Jim Rapley, who was one of the maintenance guys who knew the Foonly, and had
worked with many of the people as it was developed at Triple-I came onboard first,
followed soon by Art Durinski, a designer who had worked on TRON, Adam the Juggler, and
many other Foonly projects.  Rich Schroeppel, a consultant for Triple-I had done
the TOPS-10 hacks and occasionally consulted, as did Jim Dungan, who knew TRANEW
and a lot of the code that ran in the PFR.
</p><p>
Of course, Gary Demos and John Whitney, having gotten Triple-I started in the movie
business, saw all the shortcomings of the Foonly.  They had pushed for Triple-I
to build the DFP, the first (that I know of) high-resolution digital film printer
for motion pictures.  This was the next generation PFR, using an 8" CRT which had
fast-decaying phosphors so that it could be used for scanning in film (using photomultiplier
tubes built into a special camera) as well as printing.  The imagery was amazing.
When they left Triple-I, they put together a deal where they got Control Data Corp.
to buy a Cray supercomputer, rent the DFP from Triple-I, attache Ramtek displays
and IMI and Evans &amp; Sutherland vector tubes for encoding and motion.  That was
Digital Productions, which Omnibus eventually bought from CDC, but I'm getting
ahead of myself.  
</p><p>
The point is that Triple-I just wanted to unload the Foonly and all its peripherals
and software as one big package, and Omnibus and John Pennie were the perfect sucker.
So Jim Rapley knew a guy named Serge Polevitzki, who was at the Naval Ocean (?NOSC) down
in San Diego.  NOSC apparently had a bunch of stuff that needed to run on a TOPS-10
system and since DEC no longer made them, Dave Poole and Foonly, Inc. obliged them
by coming up with the F4, a single rack-unit 36-bit computer that ran TOPS-10.
I flew up to Berkeley to see Poole and discuss upgrades to the F1.
</p><p>
Poole was a character.  He had long hair and a long beard and glasses.  I met him
at Foonly, Inc. which was a small warehouse that had been the assembly line for
some thirty F4's.  He wore ragged clothing and bluejeans, and had a pet parrot
that rode on his shoulder most of the time.  When the parrot wasn't on his
shoulder, it was perched in one of the "unfinished" F4's.  There was a precision
shaped piece of cardboard duct-taped into this particular machine in such a
way that the bird's droppings were deflected away from the internals of the
machine.  Poole's recommendation was that we have him build us an SMD disk
controller so that we could use bigger, faster disks, like the Fujitsu Eagles
that were popular SMD drives at the time.  Unfortunately, his schedule to do this
was going to take months, and our production schedule was already overfull.
He did what he could on the microcode side, but the upgrade never happened.
</p><p>
Probably the worst moment of my life with the Foonly came after we had managed
to get it moved to Paramount Studios and were cranking through the film for
a long sequence for Flight of the Navigator, a Disney film.  In those days,
the idea that you could have a camera make a seemingly infinite move, untethered,
fascinated film directors, so they all wanted long camera moves over an infinte
plane, probably the hardest thing for rendering algorithms to manage, what with all that 
depth sorting.  Since the Foonly only had enough disk storage to hold the frame
being computed and the frame being printed, the numbers worked out like this:
30 seconds of film at 24 frames per second works out to 720 images each computed
and printed at 6000 x 4000 pixels.  At twenty minutes rendering time each frame,
that meant it took ten days to do "the run".  As we were five days into our
final "run" for Navigator, unknown to us, a Paramount electrician was outside
hot-wiring …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="creators-of-the-hippocratic-license-establish-a-nonprofit-to-empower-developers-to-use-their-technology-talents-for-social-good-and-to-prevent-harm">Creators of the Hippocratic License establish a nonprofit to empower developers to use their technology talents for social good and to prevent harm</h3>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, January 19, 2021 – The creator of the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic License</a>, an ethical license for open source, and <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for open source projects, today announced the establishment of a new nonprofit, the Organization for Ethical Source (OES).</p>

<p>Central to the philosophy of open source is the notion of software freedom, referred to as “Freedom Zero”: that open source software can be used for any purpose without restriction, <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#evil">even for explicitly “evil” purposes</a>. The world has changed since the Open Source Definition was created — open source has become ubiquitous, and is now being leveraged by bad actors for mass surveillance, racist policing, and other human rights abuses all over the world. The OES believes that the open source community must evolve to address the magnitude and complexity of today’s social, political and technological challenges.</p>

<p>Inspired by the work of Latinx and Chicanx activist organization <a href="https://twitter.com/conmijente">Mijente</a> and their #NoTechForICE campaign, the Ethical Source Movement <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/blog/ethical-source-six-month-retrospective/">launched in October 2019</a>. Its first milestone was the March 2020 release of the Hippocratic License 2.1, an ethical open source license tied to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and developed in collaboration with a pro-bono legal team from partner organization <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>. The license has already been adopted by hundreds of open source projects including the Ruby library <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr/">VCR</a>, mobile app development tool <a href="https://github.com/vinivendra/Gryphon">Gryphon</a>, Javascript mapping library <a href="https://react-leaflet.js.org/">react-leaflet</a>, and the entire open source portfolio of the <a href="https://ideas.bywetransfer.com/story/ethical-source-at-wetransfer">WeTransfer</a> corporation. But the most significant impact of the license may be the <a href="https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/ethical-source-hippocratic-license">debate it sparked</a> between ethical-minded developers and open source traditionalists around the primacy of “Freedom Zero.”</p>

<p>“For too long we’ve been comforting ourselves with the myth that technology is inherently neutral. But there is nothing neutral about police using facial recognition algorithms to target legitimate protestors, or algorithms that perpetuate bias and sexism and racism, or any other of the dozens of kinds of human rights abuses we see technology playing a part in today,” said Coraline Ada Ehmke, president and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source. “As technologists we have to accept that our work has an outsized impact on society, and that means we have an outsized responsibility to minimize the harm it can cause. The Organization for Ethical Source was founded to help technologists accept these responsibilities, and learn how to center justice and equity in the work we do. We are united in our conviction that software freedom must not come before human freedom.”</p>

<p>With a founding grant from the <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>, the Organization for Ethical Source is developing new programs that build on its initial work with the Hippocratic License — extending the reach of that effort while developing new tools and projects focusing on ethical governance, digital supply chain compliance, and other strategies. The organization’s leadership team includes founding members Coraline Ada Ehmke, Don Goodman-Wilson, and Tobie Langel. Elections for the Governing Committee are slated to take place in February 2021.</p>

<p>“There are so many ways that communities can come together today to tackle the tech industry’s biggest problems, and that is especially true about the open source community,” said Aniyia L. Williams, Principal, Responsible Technology, Omidyar Network. “We are excited to see the formation of the Organization for Ethical Source, and are thrilled to power the innovative, thoughtful, and courageous plans they have for creating accountability in building software.”</p>

<p>“Systemic change in the tech industry is long overdue, and the Organization for Ethical Source is a much-needed catalyst,” said Charity Ryerson, Executive Director of Corporate Accountability Lab. CAL is a nonprofit organization providing legal support to the new organization through developing ethical license offerings and providing free direct legal services to ethical license adopters. “We are excited to support this initiative, and hope to see tangible improvements for cobalt miners, Foxconn workers, immigrant detainees and others who have been harmed by Big Tech.”</p>

<p>The Organization for Ethical Source brings together open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, licensing experts, human rights workers, academics, and more to strategize about ways to incorporate ethics into open source work. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Learn more about the Organization for Ethical Source</a>, or <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply">apply to join</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-organization-for-ethical-source">About the Organization for Ethical Source</h3>

<p>The movement to promote ethics and social responsibility in open source was founded in October 2019 by Coraline Ada Ehmke, and led to the establishment of the nonprofit Organization for Ethical Source under Swiss law in December 2020. The organization is dedicated to giving technologists tools and resources to ensure that their work is being used for social good and to minimize harm. It develops tools to promote fair, ethical, and pro-social outcomes for those who contribute to, or are affected by, open source technologies. <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">https://ethicalsource.dev/</a></p>

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

		<p>Real time, text communications are not the invention of email. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, long distance was expensive and fax very slow. Vulcan needed an alternate method to communicate in real time for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The two offices needed written communications on production schedules and preparation of quotations. For example, the factory was required to send a periodic telex to inform the executive office of the status of every back order in the system.</li>
<li>Since a third of Vulcan’s sales volume was international, it needed to communicate rapidly with its customers, both during the sales process and to respond rapidly during breakdowns.</li>
<li>Its field service force needed a way to obtain quick answers, especially when in places like Southeast Asia where the time difference made voice telephone difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Telex was the obvious answer. A more general description of the technology and its history is given below; here we will concentrate on Vulcan’s use of telex as a business tool.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://vulcanhammer.info/32asr/" data-orig-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif" data-orig-size="213,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="32asr" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" data-large-file="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=213" src="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/32asr.gif?w=1040" alt="32asr">During the years the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcan-florida-executive-office/">Australian Avenue office</a> was in operation, both that office and the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/vulcans-chattanooga-factory/">Chattanooga facility</a> possessed telex machines similar to the one shown on the right. These were basically electromechanical terminals using roll paper printed on by a cylindrical drum with the letters on it (typewriters with a ball printer used the same idea, but the results looked better.) On the left was the paper tape punch. For most telexes, one composed them recording the telex on the paper tape, which encoded the data with a system of punched holes, similar to a player piano roll. When the telex was sent, once the connection was made, the paper tape was played back to the receiving telex. In this way the message would not be hindered by slow typing with mistakes. It was also possible to leave the tape punch on to record receiving telexes as well for retransmission. (<em>A fictional enactment of using the telex–and the possible result–is found in the novel <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/633941">The Ten Weeks</a>.</em>)&nbsp; A telex machine similar to Vulcan’s is shown in action below.</p>

<p>Telex could also be used in a “dialogue” mode similar to instant messaging or IRC chat, but Vulcan seldom used it in this way. With this, the initiator of the dialogue could ring the bell at the recipient’s end to get their attention.</p>

All of the telexes here went to Belgium, so they were probably for the Vulcan’s business associate in Vilvorde, Nilens. Since they were around Christmastime, somebody hopefully put in a “Joyeux Noel” somewhere in there.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telexes were identified by the telex number and the answerback. In the example above, when Straits Engineers sent the “Who are you?” our machine responded with its answerback, VULCAN WPB. The sending machine then replied with its own before going into the message, generally adding its telex number as well. Thus, “STREL RS” was the sender’s answerback and “23644” was the telex number. (The “RS” identified the telex as from Singapore; this is the <a title="direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rfc1394.pdf">direct ancestor to the national internet domain identifier</a>. The answerback is the key feature; it verifies to the sender that the recipient is actually receiving what’s sent. Once the recipient’s number is dialled, the cross (<a href="https://www.vulcanhammer.org/what-is-the-gospel/">the usual sign of getting access</a>) appeared with the “who are you?” request. If connected, the recipient’s answerback came up. This enabled telexes to have legal standing.</p>
<p>A little figuring for inflation with the bill shown, however, will show that the messages, generally not very long, were rather expensive. This led to a lot of people using abbreviations in telexes (such as “u” for “you”, very similar to what you see in text messaging today.) Vulcan’s people never quite got the hang of this. Still, telexes were received in real time, or at least greeted their recipients when they arrived the next morning, which is more than “snail mail” could do then or now.</p>
<p>Telex machines were virtually universal with Vulcan’s international business associates. One Vulcan agent boasted of his own status by informing us that he had his own machine, while some of his competitors used “the public telex!”</p>
<p>One of the more intensive uses of telex took place in 1981 with the <a href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/a-fistful-of-yuan-vulcan-in-china-1981-3/">negotiations and sale of the 560 package to the Petroleum Corporation of the People’s Republic of China</a>. The Chinese were as detailed in their demands of quotation presentation as they were in those for technical information. After a day of negotiations, we composed and sent a telex with our requests back to the U.S., where the day was just started. The next morning we would have our reply and resumed our negotiations. (Telephone calls in and out of China at that time were very difficult, and with a long list of spare parts and prices, would not have done the job.)</p>
<p>After that Vulcan replaced its telex machine (the Florida office was closed) with a newer model, with a dot matrix printer (still on a roll) and a screen terminal for composition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless throughout the 1980’s Vulcan’s use of the telex was in decline for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The collapse of the oil industry in the early 1980’s shrunk Vulcan’s international business considerably.</li>
<li>Vulcan obtained CCITT Group 4 faxes in the mid 1980’s, as did its customers. Combined with new economies in long distance service (domestic and international,) fax proved a more practical way to communicate with its customers, both within and outside of the U.S.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the early 1990’s telex was pretty much a thing of the past at Vulcan. In 1995, Vulcan obtained its first email address, and the cycle of sending text electronically started all over again. But telex had paved the way.</p>

Donald E. Kimberlin 1996</h4>
<p><a title="(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)" href="https://vulcanhammerinfo.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/haynes-notes.pdf">(Another interesting monograph on the subject of the telex can be found here.)</a></p>
<p>Telex certainly should be called the original form of E-Mail. Far from “dead” on a global basis, UN reports published in the “Britannica Book of the Year” indicate there are about three million Telex lines around the globe. Contrary to the impression international telephone people like to create, direct, immediate access via Telex still exists to more of the world’s political entities than does telephone. This has been the case for many years. (Totalitarian governments must like Telex; they have been known to shut down telephone service, but not Telex. The suspected reason: It can be monitored with hard copy easily, and has often been done, too. Of course, they themselves use it for military messages.)</p>
<p>Telex sprang from the same source as the Volkswagon automobile: The creative growth era of the early Third Reich. It was devised as a means to distribute military command and control messages and data in a time before we even had a structure for data processing machinery. What existed at that point in time was 45.5 bps Baudot automatic telegraphy and dial-pulsing telephone exchanges. The original Telex was essentially (director-controlled; yes, the Europeans were doing that then) rotary telephone switches modified to carry DC telegraph lines, providing a switched service for teletypewriters in the same way as was done for telephones.</p>
<p>There was one major difference: Intercity transmission facilities were expensive and in short supply, and one analog telephone circuit between cities could carry 24 (and in some applications, 25) telegraph channels bearing Telex. The economics are obvious, and probably are what keep Telex important in the Third World today.</p>
<p>In that era of transparent analog transmission lines, Telex was easily able to use telephone dial-pulsing on the local telegraph loops followed by Baudot teletype for the messages … and it did. Hence, this form of Telex operation became known as “type A Telex signaling.” It is still used that way in many nations. In those you will see a teleprinter with a control box that has a telephone dial. When Western Union decided it had should enter into Telex in the U.S., it adopted the original style and Type A signaling. Similarly, many other Europeans adopted Type A operations, among them the U.K., France and Belgium as well as others. Meantime, (I think it was L. M. Ericsson leading the move for) others saw an opportunity to simply use the numerics on the keyboard for call set-up, thus some nations adopted what became known as “Type B” Telex. By this time, the CCITT had taken charge and was setting international agreements, one of which was to set the speed of international Baudot circuits at 50 Baud, instead of 45.5. Some few nations were many years behind in upspeeding. In this writer’s experience, Cuba and Pakistan are remembered as still running 45.5 Baud Telex trunks even into the 1970’s.</p>
<p>Telex grew around the world very rapidly … long before automatic telephony, again most likely due to its economics of channel usage. Considerable networks of Telex on HF (shortwave) radio to then-remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia were established by the government-owned PTTs, operating non-stop with …</p></div></article></div>

    <p id="desc">Why pretrained machine learning models are often unusable and irreproducible — and
      what we can do about it.</p>
    <p id="by_who">By <a href="https://www.twitter.com/abidlabs/">Abubakar Abid</a></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A useful approach to designing software is through <em>contracts</em>. For every function in your codebase, you
      start by writing its contract: clearly specifying what inputs are expected and valid for that function (the
      <em>precondition</em>), and what the function will do (the <em>postcondition</em>) when provided an appropriate input.
      This is often explicitly stated in the docstring of a function. Consider this example from the <strong>math</strong> module
      in Python (implemented in C):
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The contract in the docstring has two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Precondition</strong>: input should be an integer between 2⁶² and 2⁶⁴</li>
      <li><strong>Postcondition</strong>: output is an integer within 1 of the square root of the input</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The contract is powerful because when the code is published, other developers <strong>do not need to test the function</strong> themselves, <strong>nor consider its internal implementation</strong>. They can read off the range of valid
      inputs for the function and start using it immediately. Conversely, they operate knowing that <em>if the
        precondition is not satisfied, then neither is the postcondition guaranteed</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays, <strong>pretrained machine learning models are increasingly being deployed as functions and APIs</strong>. They
      are part of companies’ internal codebases [1], released externally for use through APIs [2], and, in research,
      pretrained models are published as part of the review and reproducibility processes [3].</p>

    <p>
      A pretrained model is essentially a function: it takes in a particular input sample and makes a prediction as the
      output. And as users of these models, we need to know what data is valid to feed into the model, and which data
      can lead to unreliable predictions. <strong>It is usually infeasible to test the model ourselves with all possible
        data, and impossible to inspect the internal implementation</strong>, so if we are provided a contract with a clear
      specification of the valid input data, we can start using the model immediately and confidently. However,
      specifying “valid data” for machine learning models is much harder than it may sound. Let’s consider a few
      challenges, illustrated with examples of publicly released models, all taken from this year’s NeurIPS conference:


    </p><h3>1. When input data needs to be preprocessed in very specific ways</h3>
    <p><strong>Paper</strong>: SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this paper from MIT, the authors collect a rich dataset of satellite images of storm events recorded over time.
      Helpfully, the authors also release to the community several pretrained models on this dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to use one of the pretrained <em>nowcasting</em> models (used to predict storm movement patterns over the
      next hour) by inputting satellite images from the author’s own dataset into the model, and <strong>started getting
        predictions that didn’t make any sense</strong>. Normalizing the images in different ways didn’t seem to help. I
      traced down the example jupyter notebook that the authors had provided and saw these lines of code:
    </p>

    

    <p>It turns out that <em>some</em> of the channels in the input images were supposed to be rescaled in a <em>very
        specific way</em> for the model to produce reasonable outputs. This information was not packaged in any way with
      the pretrained model, even though it is crucial for the model to work properly. In this case (and as is commonly
      the case), the model did not throw any errors even though the data was not scaled properly. It chugged along,
      making nonsensical predictions, and I was left to realize on my own that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Information related to preprocessing of the input data should be included in the documentation of pretrained
      models; otherwise, we are left to figure out for ourselves on how to prepare data for inference. <strong>But it is at
        least conceivable that these preprocessing details <em>could</em> be included in technical documentation</strong>.
      Sometimes, it’s not just preprocessing…
    </p>
    <h3>2. When input data needs to come from a specific dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
    </p>
    
    
    
    
  
    <p>In this paper from Google, the authors release a model that decomposes images of objects into a set of images, each of which contain one individual object. They train models on a specific dataset, CLEVR, which contains synthetic images of simple geometric objects and release the models. Here we run their pretrained model on an example image from the CLEVR dataset:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*n7JkSFvi99vIVEQ8biBDkA.gif">

    <p>So far so good. But how general is this model? Can we use it to segment other kinds of objects? Here’s the result when we use an image of furniture: the model does not throw any errors, but it fails horribly:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*q0GwW-jP5NvIn5TrupGfJw.gif">

    <p>Okay, so perhaps the model only works with geometric objects. Let’s make a slight adjustment to the original image we used, and increase the brightness of its background. As a user, we would reasonably expect the model to be fairly robust to such simple transformations — certainly our human ability to decompose objects is. However, the model is anything but robust:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*WC7TAORpQdbTm8HRzx2v8A.gif">

    <p>I should be clear here — I don’t think that the model is at fault, nor the authors. The model works very well on the task that it was trained and tested on: decomposing objects in the original CLEVR dataset. However, as a user of the pretrained model, I do not know a priori whether the model will handle other kinds of images. There is no contract that tells me the model should only be used with the original images from the CLEVR dataset.</p>

    You might be thinking that these models are designed for very specific datasets; they are not meant to be generally used with real-world images. However, the situation can be even worse for models designed to work with natural images…

    <h3>3. When input data needs to satisfy other hard-to-define constraints</h3>
    <p>
      Paper: Unfolding the Alternating Optimization for Blind Super Resolution
    </p>
    
    

    
    
    <p>
      As we shall see, this third example is particularly problematic, in that it is extremely difficult to specify in
      advance what kind of images the model can accept and where it fails. The authors publish a state-of-the-art
      super-resolution model that takes in a low-resolution or standard-resolution of an image, and outputs a
      higher-resolution version. Here’s an example of the released pretrained model working beautifully:</p>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/68WpY48/DAN.png">
    <p>However, let’s try the same model with a different image:</p>

    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*XooM_r2OGcMOHfbNR65jcA.png">
    <p>
      How strange! I certainly was not expecting this blueish image as the output of a state-of-the-art super-resolution
      model. Certainly, this failure mode would not happen with a classical image processing algorithm for sharpening
      images. But with this machine learning model, we do not have any idea of the internal implementation, and because
      there is no contract, we do not know which images we can trust this model with!
    </p>

    <p>
      After spending hours wrangling with the model, I couldn’t figure out what images the model correctly resolves and
      which ones produce these strange blue outputs. Because the model is missing a contract, this is a significant
      waste of engineering effort: I spent a significant amount of time getting the model loaded and running locally
      only to realize that it won’t work for some of my data.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion — is there a solution?</h3>
    <p>
      We machine learning developers often assume that if we are able to get good performance on our test sets, our
      models are ready to deploy and release. <strong>We do not concern ourselves enough with how downstream users are using
        models with data that might look quite different from our training and test sets</strong>. However, this is happening
      more and more: as machine learning models are being released as APIs for general use, or are being deployed
      internally but data streams are changing over time, <strong>we can no longer assume that a model’s test performance is
        indicative of its performance in the real world</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to provide contracts that make it clear to users what input data are valid for our models. Otherwise,
      machine learning models will work properly until they don’t. Systems built on top of machine learning models will
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, we’ve seen that specifying valid input data through explicit instructions is difficult. What
      can be done? I have two suggestions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We develop better methods for determining whether a sample belongs to our model’s “valid data distribution.”
        Perhaps contracts can themselves be “contract functions,” which assess whether an input sample is valid if it is
        “similar” enough to our training distribution. Such methods for detecting in-distribution and
        out-of-distribution data are being developed [4], though there are caveats to using them in practice [5].</li>
      <li>We make it easier to test models so that model failures are identified easily and earlier in the model
        development process. This helps model creators know and communicate the preconditions of their library, and
        helps end users quickly know if a model is suitable for their use. This is the motivation behind our open-source
        <a href="https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio">gradio</a> library. In fact, the failure points identified in the
        models above were all easily done with the library.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And of course, we can pursue both solutions at the same time — we make it easier to identify model failure points,
      but also invest in developing contract functions for machine learning models going forward.

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>

<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

<p><span>O</span>n the evening of October 9, 2013, 50-year-old elementary school teacher Laura Ramírez was run over by a car and killed on Avenida Dr. José María Vertiz near downtown Mexico City. The vehicle fled the scene.</p>



<p>Authorities contacted Ramírez’s only close family member: her daughter, Veronica, then a 22-year-old student. They asked her to come to the prosecutor’s office to identify her mother’s body and give a statement. Veronica arrived around 10 p.m. that night, accompanied by an uncle and a handful of friends. She had no idea how the process worked — that, for instance, she was entitled to legal representation and counseling. Through her shock and grief, however, Veronica had the presence of mind to realize that there were security cameras at the intersection where her mother had been killed. </p>



<p>Mexico City is home to an enormous urban surveillance system, the <em>Centro de Comando, Control, Cómputo, Comunicaciones y Contacto Ciudadano</em>, otherwise known as the C5. Because the hit-and-run had occurred on a major road, the system’s cameras were in place to capture it. “There were at least four along the path the car took,” she remembers. She immediately mentioned this to the officials. Thanks to the footage, she hoped, the police would at least be able to identify the car, track down the driver and catch her mother’s killer. An officer responded that given the gravity of the crime, the footage would automatically be set aside. Veronica pushed: Did she need to do anything to secure the videos? The officer assured her that it was all part of official protocol: The police would request the evidence and add it to the investigation file.</p>



<p>As Veronica stood outside the office between interviews, a man who identified himself as a legal aide for the prosecutor’s office approached her and asked if they could speak privately. Veronica found the request strange, but her friends encouraged her to go, and she followed the man into a private office. He asked her to repeat her account of the incident, which he took down with a brown marker on sheets of scrap paper. “There are two things you need to do,” he told her. “You’re going to need the videos, and you have to take them to the morgue. For both of those things, I’m going to charge you 4,000 pesos (roughly $200).” The demand caught Veronica by surprise. She argued, but he gave her an ultimatum: The recordings, he pointed out, were erased once a week, and they could easily vanish. “Either they’ll get lost, or you’ll give me the money.”</p>



<p>Initially, Veronica refused to pay the bribe. She didn’t even have enough to bury her mother. But friends who had accompanied her to the station managed to scrape together 2,500 of the 4,000 pesos, which they gave to the aide. The bribe would at least ensure, they hoped, that authorities would secure the C5 footage and solve the hit-and-run.</p>



<p>But when Veronica returned to the office to follow up on the investigation weeks later, officials claimed that the videos weren’t available, despite their previous promises. Eventually, they informed Veronica that they did have two relevant clips from that night. One showed the headlights of an approaching car, but just before it came into view, the camera turned to face another direction. The other captured the intersection several hours after the accident took place. Neither involved the car that killed Veronica’s mother.</p>



<p>The officials, Veronica learned, hadn’t filed the necessary paperwork. Instead of requesting the five relevant recordings, they had requested only two. “Because I didn’t give them the full amount of money, it was like the fee only covered what they got me,” she recalls. And since private citizens can’t solicit C5 videos, she had no other recourse. Two years later,<strong> </strong>with no further progress made, the case was closed. It was classified as “unresolved” and, moreover, as “unresolvable.” Instead of helping her find her mother’s killer, Veronica laments, “this technology, which is supposed to be an instrument of justice, became a chip for extortion.”</p>

<p>Since the 2009 inauguration of the C5 <a href="http://www.caepccm.df.gob.mx/antecedentes">(then known as CAEPCCM or C4i4</a>), Mexico City’s authorities have prided themselves on having one of the most ambitious and sophisticated video surveillance systems in the world. The C5 <a href="https://www.c5.cdmx.gob.mx/">encompasses</a> more than 15,000 units, with more than 30,000 cameras, 12,700 loudspeakers, and 15,000 panic buttons, spread over 1,485 square kilometers.<strong> </strong>Each unit includes environmental sensors to detect unusual weather, seismic events, gunshots, and explosions. Everything runs on a fiber-optic network, and data is channeled to control rooms and mobile response units linked to 911 call centers and a missing-persons hotline. In addition, there are four command-and-control centers (known as C2), which focus on specific neighborhoods, and mobile units that can be deployed to monitor large public events. On major highways, cameras are equipped with software to automatically detect license plates. The city has spent more than MX$13 billion (about $660 million) in total on the infrastructure and software, and in 2019, another billion pesos (about $50 million) was budgeted to replace and update cameras.</p>



<p>Mexico City proper has nearly 9 million inhabitants, and when one includes the surrounding metropolitan area — a region nearly ten times the size of New York City — that number reaches 22 million. Within it, one finds densely packed self-built settlements, rural farming communities barely reachable by paved roads, and some of the most desirable real estate in Latin America. Climbing property values, however, are a relatively new phenomenon. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mexico City, formerly known as DF, the Distrito Federal, was notorious for its pollution and high crime rates, which earned it the nickname “El Defectuoso” — the Defective.</p>



<p>As the city’s authorities worked to change the capital’s image, the C5 was supposed to fulfill a world-class promise. In exchange for near-constant surveillance, residents would see their home become cleaner, safer, more data-driven, a destination for both tourists and capital. But that hasn’t happened. Mexico City’s district attorney estimated last year that <a href="https://www.jornada.com.mx/2019/04/27/capital/030n1cap?partner=rss">94% of crimes in</a> her jurisdiction go unreported. Of the fraction of homicides that have been reported, more than<a href="https://www.impunidadcero.org/uploads/app/articulo/131/contenido/1575312021S66.pdf"> 86% remain unresolved</a>. Furthermore, only a tiny number of police investigations involve evidence taken from C5 cameras. According to an ex-C5 official, Rafael Prieto Curiel, only 0.002% of crimes committed in Mexico City are captured on tape.</p>



<p>A handful of high-profile cases over the years have relied on the C5 system. But it’s far more common, cliché even, for police to tell victims that the relevant camera wasn’t working at the moment of the crime, or, as Veronica experienced, that the footage is no longer available. According to an as-yet-unpublished report from the think tanks Data Cívica and R3D, approximately 60% of crimes in the city take place within 200 meters of a C5 camera, but police use C5 footage in less than 1% of investigations. This isn’t the result of technical problems: According to government data, approximately 14,000 of the 15,000 modules are functioning at any given time. Nor is it a matter of storage capacity; most cameras auto-delete every seven days, and official protocol dictates that all videos related to a crime be saved once a report has been filed.</p>



<p>The C5 is a powerful tool. But like any tool, it’s only as useful as the person who wields it. Just as the C5 can help solve investigations, it can also be leveraged by police and prosecutors’ offices to support existing forms of criminality. In Veronica’s case, C5 footage became collateral for extortion. In other instances, police have been known to leak confidential photos and videos to the crime press, the <em>nota roja</em>. “If the videos benefit the police or the prosecution, they’re leaked to the media,” says Alejandro Jiménez, a criminal defense lawyer who has come up against the system’s limitations in court. “If the videos make them look bad, the police disappear the footage.” To those allegations, officials tend to repeat the same lines: <em>The cameras weren’t working. The footage was lost. That incident never happened. </em>And when police themselves are involved in crimes, impunity is all but guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong>Late on a</strong> Thursday night in February 2017, Carlos — whose name has been changed because of fear of retaliation — stumbled out of El Botellón, an upscale tapas bar in the trendy Condesa neighborhood. The 26-year-old had been drinking with friends since the afternoon. They had started at a nearby cantina, then migrated to the bar, and by the time Carlos called his Uber, the day had taken its toll on him. While waiting for his ride on Tamaulipas, an avenue home to a smattering of trendy bars, cafes, and restaurants, Carlos tripped and fell onto the sidewalk. As he pulled himself up, two police officers approached and began to berate him. “They told me I was way too drunk, that it was public indecency,” he recalls. The officers grabbed him, one from behind, and attempted to wrestle him into a police car. He felt a blow to the face. After that, he remembers nothing.</p>



<p>It was still dark when Carlos woke up and found himself sprawled on the asphalt of a residential street. His legs ached, his face felt tender, and his leather jacket was matted with blood. As he gathered himself, Carlos registered his surroundings: He was in the upper-middle-class Nápoles neighborhood — several kilometers south of the bar where he had been drinking. Between the bar and the spot where he had awoken, if they’d taken the most direct route, Carlos and the police would have passed a few dozen C5 cameras at least. On his way to work, still visibly injured, Carlos ran into two coworkers who, shocked by his appearance, called for emergency help.<strong> </strong>A police …</p></div></div>

<p>To the average person, weather forecasts inform whether or not they need to bring an umbrella to the office. But to some, it can be quite literally a matter of life and death. Organizations like the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) sit at the center of a web of highly sensitive operations, providing them weather predictions and reports. Whether that is for space agencies, natural disaster response, or the military, the accuracy of their forecasts are core to the decision making process.</p>

<p>So, it’s no wonder the ECMWF manages one of the world’s largest supercomputing clusters to run computationally-expensive predictive models. This post goes in-depth on how the ECMWF used Teleport to grant secure shell access to scientists and researchers without encumbering them with esoteric ssh commands and configuration.</p>

<p>Teleport is an OSS tool that consolidates SSH access across all environments, implements security, meets compliance requirements, and has complete visibility with a developer-friendly solution that doesn’t get in the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ecmwf-case-study-1.png" width="60%" alt="ecmwf logo"></p>

<h3 id="about-ecmwf-https-www-ecmwf-int">About <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/">ECMWF</a></h3>

<p>The European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting is an independent organization, supported by participating member states. Hosting one of the largest supercomputing facilities and meteorological data stores in the world, the ECMWF provides invaluable forecasting predictions and reporting. The organization is a key component of Europe’s meteorological infrastructure, working with various national weather services to inform weather conditions for seaports, emergency response, airports, and space agencies. For nearly 50 years, the ECMWF has remained Europe’s foremost pooling of meteorological resources.</p>

<h2 id="reconsidering-secure-remote-access">Reconsidering Secure Remote Access</h2>

<p>The ECMWF’s 10-year goals, set in 2016, had ambitious mandates; one of which required moving their datacenter from Reading, England to Bologna, Italy. The relocation was a massive undertaking, requiring multinational collaboration to move and construct a state-of-the-art data center in a 9,000 square meter facility. The infrastructure team at the ECMWF would use this opportunity to refurbish outdated services, one of which included a remote access service for members that needed to connect a shell to ECMWF’s computing powerhouse.</p>

<p>As with most growing organizations, the ECMWF’s existing in-house solution, ecAccess, became difficult to maintain. Design choices from a decade ago prevented the adoption of new technologies like OIDC, and changing dependencies required more customer support resources. To achieve the goals set in the Roadmap to 2025 initiative, the infrastructure team would go on to uproot ecAccess and transplant it with a modern remote access tool. One that would improve security, provide greater visibility, and most importantly, scale with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A key priority for ECMWF is on the one hand to remain an attractive proposition for the best scientists in the world, whilst at the same time ensuring it can provide them with the best-fitted computing capability to deliver our core mission.

<h2 id="accessing-supercomputing-clusters">Accessing Supercomputing Clusters</h2>

<h3 id="ecaccess-legacy-access-tooling">ecAccess - Legacy Access Tooling</h3>

<p>The two computational behemoths housed by the ECMWF included a high performance computing Linux cluster and two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_XC40">Cray XC40s</a> that constitute its supercomputer. Capable of up to hundreds of teraflops in processing power,  these facilities are utilized by ECMWF’s users to perform data science and build machine learning models.  Typically these jobs required remote shell access via SSH, which also exposes a way for hackers to siphon supercomputing resources. A recent example was the coordinated attempt to use other European supercomputers for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/supercomputers-hacked-across-europe-to-mine-cryptocurrency/">mining cryptocurrencies</a>.  For the ECMWF, the stakes are higher with large volumes of their data directly supporting emergency services. Days or even weeks of downtime is not tolerable.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/ecmwf-case-study-2.png" width="100%" alt="eaccess architecture diagram"></p>

<p><small>Figure 1: ecAccess Architecture</small>
Running a standard ssh agent, scientists from all around Europe could connect to the ecAccess gateway and would be greeted with a login prompt. At the bottom of the CLI, users are asked to enter a one time password they receive from an authenticator app. Despite being a preferred method of primary authentication, SSH keys were not given to any users - the risk being too high to leave keys across thousands of local machines and let them be copied, misplaced, or misused.</p>

<h3 id="growing-pains">Growing Pains</h3>

<p>Having matured into a vital coordinated effort across Europe, the ECMWF expanded their reach and computational capability. Among them would include a growing  staff of sysadmins and analysts supporting over 500 distinct internal systems to aid the work of thousands of personnel from an increasing list of member states.</p>

<p>An important build vs. buy variable is the cost of maintaining internally-built software. The problem with this calculation is that, over time, costs may unpredictably change. Consider a couple of the reasons the ECMWF felt this pain:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upgraded Dependencies</strong> - Having built custom ssh libraries for ecAccess, the infrastructure team had to keep pace with updates to the protocol and maintain forward compatibility. <strong>Support Resources</strong> - Over time, two vectors forced scarce support resources to be diverted to ecAccess. The ECMWF’s growth brought in a diverse base of users. They were faced with language barriers and users that did not have the requisite knowledge to use ecAccess without a GUI. Amplifying an already complicated process, ecAccess documentation grew more confusing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Outdated Technology</strong> -  Nowadays it is quite common to use SAML or OIDC protocols to authenticate against an identity provider and MFA with physical tokens like Yubikeys. Having barely existed at the time, ecAccess could not adopt either open standard. Instead, the ECMWF was bound to a single authentication flow for decades - entering a OTP for every shell connection - while the rest of the world took advantage of  single-sign on. Amplifying this frustration, significant resources had been fed into updating the ECMWF’s identity management systems, something they cannot fully integrate with until authentication can be decoupled from ecAccess.</p></li>

<p>ECMWF had some precise requirements guiding their search for potential successor technologies: Not only did the upgrade have to be resistant to the pressures building inside ecAccess, but could fit within the constraints the ECMWF worked under.</p>

<h2 id="transparency-in-open-source">Transparency in Open Source</h2>

<p>Like most Linux shops, especially one that creates and freely distributes software themself, the staff at ECMWF had a healthy appreciation for open-source software. So when they first came across Teleport as a possible fit, they immediately went to the Github repo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transparency is a big thing, we can look for ourselves and say ‘Yes, that’s [Teleport] quality and it’s done by people who know what they’re doing.’
<br><small>Oliver Gorwits - Manager at ECMWF</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As engineers, the team felt reassured in knowing they could collaborate with a community that would continually improve the software. But as a service operator, the ECMWF needed commercial support - someone to pick up the phone.</p>

<h2 id="teleport-for-secure-remote-access">Teleport for Secure Remote Access</h2>

<p>In the end, the infrastructure team at ECMWF chose Teleport as their solution. Adding some color to this decision, recall that the ECMWF evaluated tools that met minimum requirements and improved both security and ease of use.</p>

Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@if5: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns netns0</code></pre>
<p>Once we turn the devices on and assign proper IP addresses, any packet occurring on one of the devices will immediately pop up on its peer device connecting two namespaces. Let's start from the root namespace:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set veth0 up
$ sudo ip addr add 172.18.0.11/16 dev veth0</code></pre>
<p>And continue with the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0
$ ip link set lo up  # whoops
$ ip link set ceth0 up
$ ip addr add 172.18.0.10/16 dev ceth0
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
5: ceth0@if6: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0</code></pre>

<p>We are ready to check the connectivity:</p>

<p>At the same time, if we try to reach any other addresses from the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we are not going to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># Inside root namespace
$ ip addr show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000

# Try something from the Internet
$ ping 8.8.8.8

<p>That's easy to explain, though. There is simply no route in the <code>netns0</code> routing table for such packets. The only entry there shows how to reach <code>172.18.0.0/16</code> network:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0` namespace:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <div data-article-id="126" id="article-body">
            <p>Why am I writing this today, of all days? No real reason. It just struck me this morning to share the thought.</p>

<p>We now have an ALL TIME RECORD number (probably 100+) of COSS startups that have raised $5M+ (many have raised $10M+) in VC funding where the following two things are simultaneously True:</p>

<p>1) The COSS company has some early signs of open source momentum/traction as evidenced by GitHub Stars or project Downloads (by the way, both metrics are, on their own, deeply flawed as primary proxies for "company investable" heuristics).</p>

<p>2) The COSS company has no product IP nor clear product plans. Also, goes without saying, the company is "pre-revenue".</p>

<p>Most of these financings have NOT been publicly announced and no single firm has access to all the data (except maybe OSS Capital). In reality, my sense is that 2 out of 5 seed/pre-seed deals never get announced and perhaps the same is true for 1 out of 5 Series A deals. I'm being conservative.</p>

<p>This is a shocking new reality driven primarily by the meteoric rise of great COSS companies like HashiCorp, Elastic, MongoDB, GitHub, MuleSoft, Starburst, Confluent, GitLab and many others over the last 5 ~ years.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to find and seed invest in the next HashiCorp. If you miss that, funding the Series A is also a great idea, no?</p>

<p>Quite simply, over the last 2 ~ years, something on the order of 100+ pre-revenue and pre-product COSS companies have been seriously well funded with nothing more than a deck and a promising open source project. I cannot share this data publicly, but just know that it is accurate and that we have this data.</p>

<p>Basically every VC across all fund sizes under the sun who invests in "tech" (which is vastly digital, which is vastly software, which is vastly open source these days) is now a COSS startup investor.</p>

<p>Is this entirely bad? No. Is this entirely good? Also no. Let me explain...</p>

<p>Why is this "Bad":</p>

<p>-Founders who partner with VCs that do NOT understand the fundamentals of open source are going to be misled, distracted with having to educate their investors from scratch about very nuanced and complex things and their relationships will be extremely far from idealistic. Very few VCs (it is important to focus on the partner/individual at a given firm, not the firm itself.. given that literally only one firm on earth focuses on COSS exclusively) have a deep understanding of open source, let alone COSS, and many/most have zero-to-no track record of actually helping COSS companies successfully navigate their journeys from pre-revenue to PMF and beyond.</p>

<p>-Founders who raise meaningful capital from VC well before even possessing a basic understanding market dynamics will be forced to have full clarity on those issues in short order, and if they are not able to graduate and grow into investor expectations within 1-2 years at most, they will experience very painful misalignment conversations... which will cause them to betray social contracts and principles set in place with other key stakeholders in their open source ecosystems.</p>

<p>Why is this "Good":</p>

<p>-More COSS companies are getting funding than ever, enabling FOSS creators to transform into founders of well funded startups.</p>

<p>-Early-stage COSS companies can take this funding and invest it purely/largely in the growth of their FOSS communities, creating new abundance for the world in a positive-sum way.</p>

<p>-The VC world is learning faster than ever about the fundamental benefits of open source at the core of capitalism and business. This is a huge net positive.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm thrilled to see so much COSS funding and we inclusively cover all of it here on COSS Community via COSS Weekly and our data resources. </p>

<p>However, in these times of high capital abundance in the private startup/company equity investing markets, founders should be more careful than ever about deciding who they partner with... this is VASTLY more critical than naively optimizing for "max price for min dilution".</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.maiot.io/is-your-ml-reproducible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>It is now widely agreed that <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/5-reproducibility/">reproducibility is an important aspect of any scientific endeavor</a>.  With Machine Learning being a scientific discipline, as well as an engineering one, reproducibility is equally important here.</p>

<p>There is widespread fear in the ML community that we are living through a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-confronts-reproducibility-crisis">reproducibility crisis</a>. Efforts like the <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020">Papers with Code Reproducibility Challenge</a>, signaled a clear call-to-action for practitioners, after a 2016 Nature survey revealed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">70% of results are non-reproducible</a>.</p>

<p>While a lot of the talk amongst the community has centered on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300933">reproducing machine learning results in research</a>, there has been less focus on the production side of things. Therefore, today letâ€™s focus more on the topic of reproducible ML in production and create a larger conversation around it.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-reproducibility-important">Why is reproducibility important?</h2>

<p>
  â€œIf you canâ€™t repeat it, you canâ€™t trust itâ€� - All Ops Teams
</p>

<p>A good question to start with is why exactly reproducibility is important, for machine learning in particular. Here are list of benefits one gains by ensuring reproducibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increases <strong>trust</strong></li>
  <li>Promotes <strong>explainability</strong> of ML results</li>
  <li>Increases <strong>reliability</strong></li>
  <li>Fulfills <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>legal</strong>, and <strong>regulatory</strong> requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Concretely, ML models tend to go through a lifecycle of being destroyed, forged anew and re-created as <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/technical_debt/">development evolves from rudimentary notebook snippets to a testable, productionized codebase</a>. Therefore, we better make sure that every time a model is (re-) trained, the results are what we expect them to be.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-big-deal">Whatâ€™s the big deal?</h2>
<p>One would think that reproducibility in production ML should be easy. After all, most machine learning is scripting. How hard can it be to simply execute a bunch of scripts again at a later stage and come to the exact same result, right?</p>

<p><strong>wrong</strong></p>

<p>Reproducibility of machine learning is hard because it spans many different disciplines, from understanding non-deterministic algorithmic behaviors, to software engineering best practices. Leaving aside the fact that most machine learning code quality tends to err towards the low side (due to the experimental nature of the work), there is an inherent complexity to ML which makes things even harder.</p>

<p>E.g. Just training a model on the same data with the same configuration does not mean the same model is produced. Perhaps one could achieve a similar <em>overall</em> accuracy (or whatever other metric), but even a slight change in parameters might skew metrics for slices of your data - leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">sometimes very unpleasant results</a></p>

<p>So, how can we ensure that stuff like does not happen? In my opinion, one can break down reproducibility in the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code</li>
  <li>The configuration</li>
  <li>The environment</li>
  <li>The data</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s look at each of these in turn.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Checking code into a version control system like Git ensures a clean trace of how code evolves, and the ability to rollback to any point in history. However, Git alone is not a fix for reproducibility, but only for one aspect of it.</p>

<p>In reality, reproducibility in production is solved by version control, testing of code as well as integrations, and idempotent deployment automation. This is hard to apply in practice. E.g. The main tool for ML is Jupyter notebooks, which are notoriously difficult to check into version control. Even worse, most notebook code is not sequential in its execution, and can have an arbitrary, impossible to reproduce, sequence of execution.</p>

<p>But even if ML practitioners follow a pattern of refactoring their code into separate modules, simply checking modules into source control is still not enough to ensure reproducibility. One needs to link the commit history to model training runs and models. This can be achieved e.g. by enforcing a standard in your team that pins a git sha to experiment runs. That way there is a global unique ID that ties the code and configuration (see below) to the results it produced.</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Software Engineering preaches separation of application code and application configuration to allow for predictable and deterministic software behavior across environments. This actually translates well in a machine learning code: E.g. one can separate the model definition and training loop code, from the associated hyper-parameters which define the configuration.</p>

<p>The first step to unlock reproducibility is to actually separate configuration from code in the first place. For me this means, the code itself should NOT define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features</li>
  <li>Labels</li>
  <li>Split parameters (e.g. 80-20 split)</li>
  <li>Preprocessing parameters (e.g. the fact that data was normalized)</li>
  <li>Training hyper-parameters (including pre-processing parameters)</li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria, .e.g, metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally all these are tracked separately in a <a href="https://blog.maiot.io/declarative_configs_for_mlops/">declarative config</a> that is human readable.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>If a ML result is produced on a dev local machine, there is a high chance it is not going to be reproducible. Why? Because developers, especially relatively inexperienced ones, are not super diligent in creating and maintaining proper virtual environments.</p>

<p>The obvious solution for this one is containerizing applications, with lets say, <a href="https://docker.com/">Docker</a>. However, here is another example of when skills of ML practitioners begin diverging from conventional software engineers. Most data scientists are not trained in these matters, and require proper organizational support to help and encourage them to produce containerized applications.</p>

<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>And finally, we arrive at the data. Data versioning has become one of the most discussed topics in the production machine learning community. Unlike code, you canâ€™t simply check data into version control easily (although tools like <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> are attempting just that).</p>

<p>In the same way as code, achieving basic versioning of data does not necessarily ensure reproducibility. There is a whole bunch of metadata associated with how data is utilized in machine learning development, all of which is necessary to persist to ensure trainings are reproducible.</p>

<p>Here is a simple, but common, example that illustrates this point. If you have ever worked with machine learning, have you ever created a folder/storage bucket somewhere that has random files in varying preprocessing states? Something like, <code>normalized_1.json</code> or perhaps even timestamped <code>12_02_19.csv</code>? Technically, a timestamped file is versioned data, but that does not mean associated runs with it are reproducible: One would have to know how, when and where (i.e. the aforementioned metadata) these versioned files are used to ensure reproducibility.</p>

<h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example</h3>
<p>While it may fall outside the scope of this blog, the open-source MLOps framework ZenML showcases a clear example 
of putting these principles in action <a href="https://docs.zenml.io/benefits/ensuring-ml-reproducibility.html">here</a></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducibility in machine learning is not trivial, and ensuring it in production is even harder. ML teams need to be fully aware of the precise aspects to track in their processes to unlock reproducibility.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for a head start to enable reproducibility: check out <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenML</a>, an open-source MLOps framework for reproducible machine learning - and leave a star while youâ€™re there.</p>

<p>Also, hop on over to our <a href="https://zenml.io/slack-invite">Slack Channel</a> if you want to continue the discussion.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be back in a few days to talk about using Git in a machine learning setting - stay tuned!</p>

<![CDATA[Building an NLP Engine Is Hard, but Not as Hard as Defining Terms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In my full-time role at <a aria-label="Nuvi (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nuvi.com/blog/strategic-decision-making-nuvis-all-new-language-engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nuvi</a>, I’ve been lucky enough to work on a team where we’re able to push the boundaries in the natural language processing field. We built out several different “facets” that we score text on, including sentiment, emotion, vulgarity, tense, and currently, we’re working on promotion detection.</p>
<p>While the technical side of NLP is hard, one of the hardest things was unexpected – defining the boundaries between the categories in question. Which words count as vulgar? Does anticipation entail positive emotions? Can a single tweet exude anger and fear at the same time despite being opposites according to Plutchik? In this article, we’ll explore some of these questions and how we ended up answering them.</p>
<h2>Emotion Facets</h2>
<p>The eight emotions we set out to build a classification engine for are defined by <a aria-label="Plutchik's wheel (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.6seconds.org/2020/08/11/plutchik-wheel-emotions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Plutchik’s wheel</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Anger</li><li>Fear</li><li>Joy</li><li>Sadness</li><li>Trust</li><li>Disgust</li><li>Anticipation</li><li>Surprise</li></ul>
<p>Our emotion detection is based on a probabilistic algorithm that requires training and test data from human-annotations. In order to get a high-quality dataset, we found early on that simply telling our annotators to categorize sentences as to whether or not the author was expressing “anticipation” wasn’t <em>nearly</em> enough instruction. Once we got down to the brass tacks of some specific examples, we found that <em>we didn’t even agree internally</em> on classifications in many instances.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the examples we had trouble with as a team and go over the conclusions we came to. If you have thoughts be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" rel="noopener">tweet at me</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the definition of anticipation according to <a aria-label="Oxford (opens in a new tab)" href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oxford</a> is “The action of anticipating something; expectation or prediction.” In other words, we’re looking for when someone is showing forethought, making a prediction, etc. Here are some examples we agreed on quickly as expressing “anticipation”:</p>
<ul><li>“I can’t wait to go to the movie theater again!”</li><li>“I’m so excited for sports to come back, can’t happen soon enough!”</li><li>“Tesla stock is way too high, it’s going to tank soon.”</li></ul>
<p>The first one we had trouble with was:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m so nervous to go back to the office. Working from home has been great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us had the idea that “anticipation” carried a connotation of “being excited”. In other words, you can’t really anticipate something if you <em>don’t want</em> it to happen. We eventually decided that this isn’t a useful definition for several reasons. First, we already do sentiment classification separately, so baking positive sentiment into the anticipation facet isn’t super helpful. Second, the opposite of anticipation in our emotion wheel is “surprise”. We all agreed that surprises can be good or bad. It stands to reason the surpise’s opposite, anticipation, should behave the same way.</p>
<p>The next problematic example arose a few days later:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know if I’m going to win</p></blockquote>
<p>One of my teammates made the point that this sentence expresses apprehension, which can be considered a form of anticipation. I played devil’s advocate saying that “I don’t know” is the polar opposite of a prediction, how can that be anticipation?</p>
<p>In the end, we found that we had to provide paragraph-long explanations of each category to our annotators, complete with examples of what is and isn’t counted as a part of the category in question.</p>
<h2>Vulgarity Detection</h2>
<p>NSFW Disclaimer: <em>I’m going to talk about our vulgarity detection, and will need to say some naughty words. If you find that offensive turn back now!</em></p>
<p>The way the current iteration of our vulgarity engine works is to take a piece of text as input, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Well hot damn those potatos hit the spot!”</p></blockquote>
<p>And output a fractional score from 0-1 representing how likely the text is to contain vulgar text. For the above sample, it might be something like <code>.75</code> Which brings us to our first problem, <strong>what do <em>we</em> consider to be vulgar?</strong></p>
<p>According to one of my teammates “damn”, “shit” and “hell” aren’t bad words. However, while <em>he may not</em> consider them to be, <em><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">many people do</a></em>. We’re left in the interesting position of trying to rank all the vulgar words. Here are some of the biggest issues we ran into with vulgarity:</p>
<h3>Not all bad words are created equally</h3>
<p>Most people would loosely agree with the following ranking from most vulgar -&gt; to least vulgar :</p>
<ul><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<h3>Religious / Culture Specific</h3>
<p>However, problems arise when people of different religious beliefs examine the list. A Christian person may consider the following list accurate:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Jesus Christ!</li><li>Oh my God!</li><li>Shit</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>Whereas the atheist/agnostic/pagan may not consider “Jesus Christ!” or “Oh my God!” to deserve to be on the list at all.</p>
<h3>Geographically Specific</h3>
<p>If you’re from England proper, you may also expect a few additional words:</p>
<ul id="block-e0d6e2ae-fb75-4375-89e4-0ce5d61c4e1f"><li>Fuck</li><li>Wanker</li><li>Bitch</li><li>Shit</li><li>Bloody</li><li>Damn</li><li>Hell</li></ul>
<p>In the end, we ended up mixing the concept of probability and intensity for the sake of simplicity and we’ve found that our clients are happy with the result. For example, the presence of an intensely “bad” word that’s recognized by basically everyone as vulgar will have a higher weight in the probability calculation than one which is weaker or not accepted by everyone as “bad”.</p>
<p><code>vulgarity_weight = intensity * acceptance</code></p>
<p>Once we started looking at everything as a fluid spectrum it became much easier to agree amongst ourselves what constitutes “vulgarity”. My coworker who claimed “shit”, “damn”, and “hell” aren’t vulgar easily admitted that they’re <em>more vulgar</em> than trivial interjections like “crap”, “dang”, or “heck”.</p>
<h2>Promotion and Solicitation Detection</h2>
<p>The project we’re working on currently has also turned out to be a vague and difficult one to pin down. The goal is to classify text as to whether it’s promotional or not, but we’ve had a hard time defining what we want. For example, we all agreed quickly that the following we classify as :promotional”:</p>
<ul><li>“We are doing a sweet promo this week! Sign up for 20% off”</li><li>“Our new product just launched, be sure to check it out”</li><li>“GORGEOUS 😍 previously owned Gucci backpack for $1700😍😍 ⭐️WE SHIP ⭐️ Call the store to purchase 555-555-5555 📲”</li></ul>
<p>The following however posed an interesting problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do I want a $42&nbsp;@gucci lipstick yes I do…. can I afford it right now No I cant&nbsp; but it’s soooo good!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>While it’s obviously promoting Gucci, it isn’t actually soliciting direct action from the reader. There’s no call to action. Is this a requirement of a solicitation as scored by Nuvi? We’re not sure yet – but we’re figuring that out.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>My interest in <em>Assembly</em> language started when I was a kid, mainly because of computer viruses of the <code>DOS</code> era. I’ve spent countless hours contemplating my first humble collection of source codes and samples (you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/virii">https://github.com/guitmz/virii</a>) and to me, it’s cool how flexible and creative one can get with <em>Assembly</em>, even if its learning curve is steep.</p>

<p>I’m an independant malware researcher and wrote this virus to learn and have fun, expanding my knowledge on the several <em>ELF</em> attack/defense techniques and <em>Assembly</em> in general.</p>

<p>The code does not implement any evasion techniques and detection is trivial. Samples were also shared with a few major Antivirus companies prior to the release of this code and signatures were created, such as <code>Linux/Midrashim.A</code> by <a href="https://www.eset.com/">ESET</a>. I’m also working on a <em>vaccine</em> which will be available at a later date. I’ll update this post when it’s ready.</p>

<p>The payload is not destructive, as usual. It just prints the harmless lyrics of <a href="https://legacyofkain.fandom.com/wiki/Ozar_Midrashim">Ozar Midrashim</a> song to <code>stdout</code> and the layout of an infected file is the following (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/h4PVnL1.png">full image</a>):</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p><code>Midrashim</code> is a <em>64 bits</em> Linux infector that targets ELF files in the current directory (non recursively). It relies on the well known <code>PT_NOTE -&gt; PT_LOAD</code> infection technique and should work on regular and <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1975793">position independent</a> binaries. This method has a high success rate and it’s easy to implement (and detect). Read more about it <a href="https://www.symbolcrash.com/2019/03/27/pt_note-to-pt_load-injection-in-elf/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It will not work on <code>Golang</code> executables, because those need the <code>PT_NOTE</code> segment to run properly (infection works, but infected file will segfault after virus execution).</p>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, it makes use of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pread64">pread64</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/pwrite64">pwrite64</a> to read/write specific locations in the target file when it should use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> instead, for flexibility and reliability. A few other things could be improved too, like detecting first virus execution with a better approach and more error handling to minimize pitfalls.</p>

<p>I had so many ideas for the payload of Midrashim, from inspiration I got from projects at <a href="http://www.pouet.net/">http://www.pouet.net/</a> to controlling the terminal with ANSI escape codes (more on that <a href="https://www.guitmz.com/having-fun-with-ansi-codes-and-x64-linux-assembly/">here</a> - which is something I wrote with Midrashim in mind).</p>

<p>Due to lack of free time and given the complexity of implementing such things in Assembly, specially in a code of this nature, I ended up with something simpler and will probably revisit this subject on a future project.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>This is my first full assembly infector and should be assembled with <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a> x64. Its core functionality consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reserving space on stack to store values in memory</li>
<li>Checking if its virus first run (displays a different payload message if running for the first time)</li>
<li>Open current directory for reading</li>
<li>Loop through files in the directory, checking for targets for infection</li>
<li>Try to infect target file</li>
<li>Continue looping the directory until no more infection targets are available, then exit</li>
</ul>

<p>Full code with comments is available at <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim">https://github.com/guitmz/midrashim</a> and we’ll now go over each step above with a bit more detail.</p>

<h3 id="the-secret-of-getting-ahead-is-getting-started">The secret of getting ahead is getting started</h3>

<p>For the stack buffer, I used <code>r15</code> register and added the comments below for reference when browsing the code.</p>

<p>Note the values, for example, the ELF header, which is <em>64 bytes</em> long. Since <code>r15 + 144</code> represents its start, it should end at <code>r15 + 207</code>. The values in between are also accounted for, like <code>ehdr.entry</code> that starts at <code>r15 + 168</code>, which is <em>8 bytes</em> long, ends at <code>r15 + 175</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; r15 + 0 = stack buffer = stat</span>
<span>; r15 + 48 = stat.st_size</span>
<span>; r15 + 144 = ehdr</span>
<span>; r15 + 148 = ehdr.class</span>
<span>; r15 + 152 = ehdr.pad</span>
<span>; r15 + 168 = ehdr.entry</span>
<span>; r15 + 176 = ehdr.phoff</span>
<span>; r15 + 198 = ehdr.phentsize</span>
<span>; r15 + 200 = ehdr.phnum</span>
<span>; r15 + 208 = phdr = phdr.type</span>
<span>; r15 + 212 = phdr.flags</span>
<span>; r15 + 216 = phdr.offset</span>
<span>; r15 + 224 = phdr.vaddr</span>
<span>; r15 + 232 = phdr.paddr</span>
<span>; r15 + 240 = phdr.filesz</span>

<span>; r15 + 416 = dirent.d_reclen</span>
<span>; r15 + 418 = dirent.d_type</span>
<span>; r15 + 419 = dirent.d_name</span>
<span>; r15 + 3000 = first run control flag</span>
<span>; r15 + 3001 = decoded payload</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Reserving stack space is easy, there are different ways of doing it, one is to subtract from <code>rsp</code>, then just store it in <code>r15</code>. Also right on start, we store <code>argv0</code> to <code>r14</code> (it’s going to be needed next) and we push <code>rdx</code> and <code>rsp</code>, which need to be restored before the end of virus execution, so the infected file can run properly.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>v_start:</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r14</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span> <span>+</span> <span>8</span><span>]</span>  <span>; saving argv0 to r14</span>
    <span>push</span> <span>rdx</span>
    <span>push</span> <span>rsp</span>
    <span>sub</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>5000</span>       <span>; reserving 5000 bytes</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>r15</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>        <span>; r15 has the reserved stack buffer address</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To check for the virus first execution, we get <code>argv0</code> size in bytes and compare to the final virus size, which was stored in <code>V_SIZE</code>. If greater, it’s not the first run and we set a control value into a place in the stack buffer for later use. This was a last minute addition that it’s not great (but pretty easy to implement and rather obvious).</p>

<p>We need to find targets to infect. For that we’ll open the current directory for reading using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/getdents64">getdents64</a> syscall, which will return the number of entries in it. That goes into the stack buffer.</p>

<p>Now the hunt gets a little more… <em>wild</em>, as we loop through each file from directory listing we just performed. Steps performed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open target file</li>
<li>Validate that it’s an <em>ELF</em> and <em>64 bits</em> (by verifying its magic number and class information from its header)</li>
<li>Check if already infected (by looking for the infection mark that should be set in <code>ehdr.pad</code>) and

<ul>
<li>if yes, move to next file, until all files in the directory are checked</li>
<li>If not, loop through the target <em>Program Headers</em>, looking for a <code>PT_NOTE</code> section, starting the infection process upon finding it</li>
</ul></li>

					<div><h3><span>Vulnerabilities threaten DNS integrity (again)</span></h3>
<p>The JSOF research labs are reporting 7 vulnerabilities found in <em>dnsmasq</em>, an open-source DNS forwarding software in common use. Dnsmasq is very popular, and we have identified approximately 40 vendors whom we believe use dnsmasq in their products, as well as major Linux distributions.</p>
<p><br>The DNS protocol has a history of vulnerabilities dating back to the famous 2008 Kaminsky attack. Nevertheless, a large part of the Internet still relies on DNS as a source of integrity, in the same way it has for over a decade, and is therefore exposed to attacks that can endanger the integrity of parts of the web.</p>
<h3><span>DNSpooq</span></h3>
<p><span>The Dnspooq vulnerabilities include DNS cache poisoning vulnerabilities as well as a potential Remote code execution and others.&nbsp;</span><span>The list of devices using dnsmasq is long and varied.&nbsp;</span><span>According to our internet-based research, prominent users of dnsmasq seem to include Cisco routers, Android phones, Aruba devices, Technicolor, and Red-Hat, as well as Siemens, Ubiquiti networks, Comcast, and others listed below.&nbsp;</span><span>Depending on how they use dnsmasq, devices may be more or less affected, or not affected at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The origin of the name DNSpooq is a merge of 3 elements: DNS spoofing, the idea of a spook spying on Internet traffic, and the ‘q’ at the end of dnsmasq, replacing the ‘k’ of spook with a ‘q’. The spy or spook graphic illustrates the effects of an effective DNS spoofing on the ability to spy on internet traffic. The JSOF-pink glasses show how looking through tainted glasses, or a compromised middleman may alter your perception of the reality.</span></p>
<p><span>DNSpooq demonstrates that DNS implementations are still insecure, even today, 13 years after the last major attack was described.</span></p>
<p>Given the vulnerabilities in DNS over the years, you would think that the security-enhancement mechanisms that have been developed in response,&nbsp; would be ubiquitous by now. However, in reality, DNSSEC is still not very widely deployed, and neither is HSTS. For example, according to research from 2017, adoption of HSTS among the 1M most popular websites <span><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/scholarly_papers/Petrov%2C%20Ivan_1801.pdf">was only at about 5%</a></span>). According to some rough estimates performed by JSOF with the help of large Internet companies, and matching external sources, around <span><a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/keeping-up-with-performance-demands-of-encrypted-web-traffic">15-20% of Internet traffic</a></span> is still completely unencrypted, and users still click through to insecure websites.</p>

<h3><span>History</span></h3>
<p>In 2008, well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky found and disclosed a fundamental flaw in the Internet naming scheme that affected the most common DNS software and the integrity of the way the Internet worked at the time.</p>
<p>Kaminsky proved that attackers can impersonate any website name and steal data. (This has since become known as the “Kaminsky Attack”).</p>
<p>DNS has been considered a somewhat insecure protocol for decades, ever since the Kaminsky disclosure and even before that, though it is assumed to guarantee a certain level of integrity. This is the reason it is still heavily relied upon. At the same time, mechanisms have been developed to improve the security of the original DNS protocol. These mechanisms include HTTPS, HSTS, DNSSEC, and other initiatives. Browsers also try to increase users awareness by alerting them before accessing insecure sites with messages such as <a href="https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/your-connection-is-not-private/"><span>“Your Connection is Not Private”</span></a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even with all these mechanisms in place, a DNS hijack is still a dangerous attack in 2021. A large part of the Internet still relies on DNS in a similar manner as in 2008, and is exposed to attacks of the same types.</p>

					<div><p><span>The DNSpooq vulnerability set divides into 2 types of vulnerabilities:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DNS cache poisoning attacks</strong>, similar to the Kaminsky attack, but different in some aspects.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer overflow vulnerabilities</strong> that could lead to remote code execution.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> <strong>DNS Cache Poisoning:</strong> The impact of DNS cache poisoning of the routing equipment DNS forwarding server can potentially lead to different kinds of fraud if users believe they are browsing to one website but are actually routed to another.</p>
<p>Traffic that might be subverted includes regular Internet browsing as well as other types of traffic, such as emails, SSH, remote desktop, RDP video and voice calls, software updates, and so on. Some of these protocols have built-in measures to mitigate this type of attack, with varying degrees of effectiveness and so YMMV (Your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span>DNS Cache Poisoning</span></strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png" alt="" width="529" height="234" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946.png 702w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%946-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px"></p>
<p><strong>(2) Device take over: </strong>In addition to cache poisoning, every device on which an attacker can perform DNS cache poisoning can also potentially be taken over by the attacker. For example, in the case of a router, the attacker would then have complete control over all traffic going in and out of the network.</p>
<p>There are additional impacts possible for these types of attacks. <strong><em>These are hypotheticals</em></strong>, since to our knowledge they have never been performed by a malicious actor in this way, but they are a definite possibility if the vulnerabilities are exploited correctly. Even so, given the hypothetical nature of the situation, it is hard to analyze how likely they are to actually occur and what value they could bring to different malicious actors. These possibilities include:<br><strong>(A) Massive DDOS</strong>: Diversion of a large amount of web-traffic to an attacker-controlled website could be used to generate massive JavaScript-fueled Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Simplistic calculations show that the size of the attack could be on the same order of magnitude as the biggest DDOS attacks performed to date.</p>
<p><span><strong>Massive DDOS<br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png" alt="" width="571" height="266" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947.png 818w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-300x140.png 300w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%947-768x358.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px"><br></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(B) Reverse DDOS</strong>: Prevention of certain users from accessing a website and logging of access attempts to a domain.</p>
<h3><span>Reverse DDOS<strong><br><img src="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png" alt="" width="369" height="289" srcset="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945.png 721w, https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%945-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>(C)</strong> “<b>Semi-</b><strong><b>Wormable</b>” <b>attacks</b></strong>: In situations where a mobile device moves between networks, the attack may be semi-wormable. It is not wormable in the traditional sense, since there are some pre-conditions and efforts needed on the attacker side for the exploit replication, but is semi-wormable in the sense that the exploit can continue to spread between vulnerable devices without explicit user interaction and without need for additional attacker access. In this scenario, a mobile device that was previously browsing in a network which uses an infected dnsmasq server receives a bad DNS record. When the device reaches a new network, it could infect the new network as well.</p>

              <p>Problems emerging from data are common in research as well as in the industry. Those problems are dealt with as part of our project, but we usually don't bother solving them at their origin. We fix the data locally once, and we go on with our project. This is certainly a valid method in some cases, but as we share data more and more between projects, we are finding ourselves repeating the same processes over time and across teams. This issue is particularly true for public datasets shared by many people to train many machine learning models. I will show you how to create, maintain, and contribute to a long-living dataset that will update itself automatically across projects, using git and DVC as versioning systems, and DAGsHub as a host for the datasets.</p><h2 id="changing-datasets-is-a-common-process">Changing datasets is a common process</h2><p>I remember that during my undergraduate studies, I had to generate an instance segmentation model for cucumber plant parts, using a custom dataset of segmented leaves, cucumbers, and flowers. At a very early stage, I discovered I couldn't get reasonable results with the data given initially. I decided I would fix the annotations myself on about a dozen pictures. As expected, this solved 80 percent of the issues I was having. This is a good opportunity to say that manual data labor is underrated. Investing a few hours in fixing the data was the best thing I could do for the project. Then, of course, I went on with my life, leaving the fixed dataset on the lab computer, but knowing that eventually, my fixes were going to vanish.</p><p>Naturally, this process was gradual. I started with the original dataset, then I fixed a part of the annotations. At some point, I added completely new pictures, decided to redo some of them. I iterated over the data with multiple manipulations over time. Many of them I treated as "Debug trial-and-errors", naturally not keeping track of my working directory rigorously. During those iterations, I ran training sessions, while doing my best to keep a detailed record of my "experience". If you are still reading, you probably understand exactly what I am talking about. Well, the world has changed since then, and many data versioning tools have evolved to help. This is a good opportunity to recommend this <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-version-control-tools/">comparison between data version control tools</a> we published at the end of 2020.</p><h2 id="what-is-data-versioning">What is data versioning?</h2><p>While my project was a total mess data-wise, its code was very well tracked by git. The reason is that I could just run the following magical commands that everyone knows:</p><pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "fixed training input directory"
</code></pre><p>Back then I wasn't able to do any magical command of that sort for my data. Now, with <a href="https://dvc.org/">DVC</a> and DAGsHub in the world, this is no longer the case. There is no reason on earth why you should not at least have a simple code and data versioning system set in place. If you are not familiar with DVC, I recommend you go through <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/">this basic data versioning tutorial</a>, but it is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a prerequisite to understand the rest of this post. All you really need to know is that now we have a new, magical command:</p><pre><code>dvc commit
</code></pre><p>That will create a snapshot of the tracked data, without inflating your git repository.</p><p>While data versioning solves the problem of managing data in the context of your machine learning project, it brings with it a new approach to managing <strong>datasets</strong>. This approach, also described as data registries <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/data-registries">here</a>, consists of creating <strong>a git repository entirely dedicated to managing a dataset</strong>. This means that instead of training models on frozen datasets - something researchers, students, kagglers, and open source machine learning contributors often do - you could link your project to a dataset (or to any file for that matter), and treat it as a dependency. After all, <strong>data can and should be treated as code</strong>, and follow through a review process. You can read more about that in another post about <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-bugs-how-to-fix-them/">data bugs and how to fix them</a>.</p><p><strong>Warning - Don't continue reading if you feel threatened by knowledge!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc/giphy.gif"><p><small><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/arielle-m-star-trek-information-overload-3o6gDSdED1B5wjC2Gc">via GIPHY</a></small></p></center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I am joking, of course, this isn't going to be rocket science at all. In fact, I will demonstrate how to use such a living-dataset in a project similar to my university project.</p><h2 id="creating-a-data-registry-to-use-it-as-a-living-dataset">Creating a data registry to use it as a living-dataset</h2><p>In order to demonstrate this new concept of living-datasets, I have set one up myself, as well as a machine learning model using it as a dependency.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset">Repository A</a></strong> - AKA the living dataset, is going to be a simple project, with magical metadata files that point to real big files stored in a dedicated storage. I can organize the dataset files into directories, add code files with <code>utils</code> functions to work with it, or whatever I see fit to store and present my dataset to whoever might want to consume it.</p><p><strong><a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentor">Repository B</a></strong> - AKA the machine learning project, is where I want to use the files stored in my living-dataset. This repository will import a directory from Repository A using DVC, and this will do the trick of having that directory manageable and updatable.</p><p>To create a data registry, just create a git + DVC directory.</p><pre><code>mkdir my-dataset &amp;&amp; cd my-dataset
git init
dvc init
</code></pre><p>Congrats! Your living-dataset is alive. Now we need to add some files to it.</p><figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/giphy.gif"></figure><p>In my case, I took a handful of screenshots from a beloved TV Show, and annotated my favorite character in it, using the awesome open source <a href="https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator">COCO annotator project</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/annotator-demo2_1.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After annotating around 40 pictures, I knew it was going to be enough for a pre-trained Mask-RCNN with a ResNet50 backbone, to give decent results (15 would have probably been enough too, but it was too fun to stop). I exported a <code>.json</code> annotation file, put it in my repository along with the screenshots I took. At this point my working directory looked like this:</p><pre><code>.
├── annotations
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── grogu.json
└── images
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 000.png
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 001.png
    .
    .
    .
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 206.png
 &nbsp;&nbsp; └── 208.png
</code></pre><p>Then I ran the magic commands to start tracking the data files.</p><pre><code>dvc add annotations
dvc add images
git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "Starting to manage my dataset"
</code></pre><p>Since I like visualizations I wrote a script in <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/grogu-segmentation-dataset/src/master/Playground.ipynb">this python notebook</a> to render previews of my dataset into a <a href="https://dagshub.com/Simon/grogu-segmentation-dataset/src/master/preview">preview directory</a>, which will also be tracked by DVC. Then I just push my code and data to my remote repository, so that I can access it from everywhere, and share it with my collaborators.</p><pre><code>git push origin master
dvc push -r origin
</code></pre><p>Note: I skipped the part of opening a repository on GitHub / DAGsHub and setting up the remote storage, <a href="https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-data-versioning/#pushing-code-data-and-models-to-dagshub">the tutorial</a> should cover that.</p><h2 id="using-a-living-dataset-in-a-machine-learning-project">Using a living-dataset in a machine learning project</h2><p>Now it is time to use my dataset as a dependency in my machine learning project. I will not be able to recreate my cucumber project from school, since I do not have access to the data, so I will substitute the cucumbers with the beloved fictional character from above.</p><p>I want my project directory to look like the following:</p><pre><code>.
├── data
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── preprocessed
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── raw
└── src
</code></pre><p>I want to import a directory from my dataset and treat it as <code>raw</code> files. I can do it by running from inside my repository:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p data/raw

dvc import -o data/raw/images \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/images

dvc import -o data/raw/annotations \
https://dagshub.com/Simon/baby-yoda-segmentation-dataset \
data/annotations</code></pre><p>This will specifically download the directories <code>images</code> and <code>annotations</code> from inside my dataset repository, and keep information on how to continue tracking the changes made in it. More on tracking the changes will be explained later, but this is pretty much it.</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/data-repo--1-.png 921w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In the chart above you can see a representation of how it works. The arrows go in the direction of dependencies. Every time I know the dataset has changed, I just run the command</p><pre><code>dvc update
</code></pre><p>The <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/update">command above</a> will check for changes in the tracked ref of the repository, and pull them to my local directories. Then I re-run my pipeline from scratch - Train my model, save the best one, and commit my results. Notice that we can use this method of <code>dvc import</code> + <code>dvc update</code> to get the output model as a dependency in another project if we wanted to.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for reading along, I hope you enjoyed it. The project is still a work in progress (but what project isn't?). So if you find mistakes, or improvements to make, either in the dataset or the model, then just contribute to them! It's fairly easy to fork repositories, pull the data, push it, and merge it. Especially with <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/data-science-pull-requests/">data-science pull requests</a>. The process can easily be adapted to any segmentation dataset, so feel free to do so as well.</p><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asher-yartsev/">Asher</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/or-shemesh-4a99a7101/">Or</a>, my fellow students from the original segmentation project that gave me inspiration for this mini-project.</p><p>Here are some results just for fun!</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png" alt="" srcset="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/grogus.png 600w, https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/grogus.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>There should be anti-trust laws that make it illegal for social media software to be closed and centralized. What does this mean and why is it important? Let’s start with the why.</p><h2 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h2><p>Social media apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter all have something in common: They benefit from so-called network effects. Simply said, this means that the value of the service increases for each user as additional users join the service. For example, you wouldn’t use Instagram if all you had was an empty feed or WhatsApp if none of your friends were on it.</p><p>A network effect is both hard to achieve and hard to destroy. That’s why it’s almost impossible for a new company with little funds to compete with existing services. And that’s why almost no users leave to competing products (even if there were any). Heck, it’s even hard to start a social media company if you have a shit ton of cash (just ask the folks from Google Plus).</p><p>Companies realized that there’s no way to create a social network if you charge users, even if that amount would be something small like a few dollars. You just can’t get enough people on there to make the network as a whole valuable enough for all users. They also realized that the data they collect from people using their social network is extremely valuable to other companies, namely advertisers. That’s why almost all social networks make money by showing you ads based on your data.</p><p>In the last few years, social media became insanely popular and the primary source of information for a lot of people. This development came with a bunch of problems.</p><p>One such problem is misinformation. Because of inherent mechanisms that make sharing easy, information spreads super fast on social media. And so does misinformation. And because anyone can post anything, there’s a truck load of misinformation being shared and consumed. You might have heard the term Fake News. The problem is though, that sometimes real facts are also being regarded as fake and if enough users share it, people think it’s true. Of course, evil companies figured out how to automate the spread of misinformation with bots and ads and succesfully shaped public opinion to their advantage. By now, it’s clear that Russian agents meddled with the 2016 US elections through this medium.</p><p>Another problem is censorship. Twitter and Facebook have always been banning accounts that post content which is against their terms of service. Stuff like child porn and obvious hate speech. Recently, they also banned the President of the United States, Donald Trump, for inciting violence in connection with the events at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. On the one hand, Twitter and Facebook are private companies and can decide who they ban from their platform. On the other hand, they have become the main publishing platform for a lot of public figures, including Trump. Therefore, many opponents of censorship on social media say that Twitter and friends should be regulated as public forums and the government should decide who gets to have a Twitter account, not Twitter itself.</p><p>A third problem is power. As we have seen, it’s hard for new companies to compete with existing social media companies, and it’s hard for users to leave the platform for a lack of alternatives and existing network effects. This means that Facebook, Twitter and Google (not with Search, but e.g. with YouTube) have a lot of power. That’s why they can pull a lot of shit (remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal?), but get away with a slap on the wrist because users just can’t leave.</p><p>So, what’s all this to do with closed and central and what does that even mean?</p><h2 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h2><p>Let’s get more technical. When saying “closed and central social media”, I actually refer to their underlying protocols. A protocol simply is a specification of how two or more parties communicate with each other. Like, what kind of data can be sent, how it is sent, what kind of responses can be expected and so on. Think of it like a set of rules.</p><p>Open protocols are protocols which are defined openly for everyone to see what the rules are. Closed protocols are proprietary and not shared publicly. Centralized protocols only allow one central authority (e.g. server), whereas decentralized protocols allow for servers and services to talk to each other.</p><p>The internet is built on open, decentralized protocols. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol (IP)</a> defines how data packages are sent around and is literally <em>the</em> basis for our open and amazing internet. Another one that you probably use every day is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a> - that’s how email works. There are also offline examples of open and decentralized protocols, such as the physical mail system. I can send a letter from Berlin to San Fransisco and it works, although it’s not the same company providing the service in Germany and the US. I can also call or text my friend, even though I’m with Verizon and she’s with AT&amp;T.</p><p>Closed and central protocols don’t allow this open interoperability. If I want to read and send Tweets, I have to use the central service controlled completely centrally by Twitter. If I want to watch a video on YouTube, I have to use YouTube. If I want to send a message to my group of friends, I have to use WhatsApp since that’s the only chat app they (and two billion other people) use.</p><p>Compare this to email. If I have an email account with Fastmail and you have an account with Gmail, we can still communicate with each other. Imagine if Google had “invented” email and made it a centralized system, we would all need to be on Gmail to talk to each other. Pretty crappy, right? But that’s exactly the case with all social media today.</p><p>If WhatsApp would use an open and decentralized protocol, let’s call it Chat Protocol (CP) other companies could also offer WhatsApp services and host their own server. Let’s say that other apps like Telegram and Signal would also use the same protocol, CP. I could easily use Signal to message my friends on WhatsApp. It would give every person the freedom to choose a service provider they like (for whatever reason). It would allow for fair competition, and remove power from one central entity. If your account gets banned from one provider, you can create a new account with a different provider and keep talking to your friends.</p><p>Of course, misinformation can still spread if uncontrolled. But with a decentralized system, you would have many service providers dealing with the problem and probably do a better job than one player that needs to deal with all of the world’s misinformation.</p><p>Of course, the flip side of too little censorship means that there will be more accounts with pedophiles and racists. But today, hosting providers are already quite good with taking this type of content offline (e.g. websites), so there’s no reason to think that they couldn’t do it with a decentralized social media app, too.</p><p>You see, there are many advantages to using open and decentralized protocols. It’s also obvious why big social media companies do not want to use them and instead create these walled gardens to maximize their profit and stronghold. I wager that, left alone, these companies will never do the right thing and open up and decentralize their networks. (One possible expection: Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">has announced</a> that they eventually want to open up, but it remains to be seen what that exactly will turn into.)</p><p>So, what’s the solution? One solution could be market-based: Just make software based on open protocols that is better and users will jump ship and start using those. In fact, these alternatives already exist. For example, there’s Mastodon, a decentralized Twitter alternative, or Matrix, a decentralized instant messaging app. But compared to Twitter and WhatsApp, noone uses these alternatives. Why? Well, of course they need to get better and improve their usability and what not, but the main reason is what I mentioned before: It’s damn hard to compete with an existing social media service because of network effects. And the more users they get, the stronger the network effects become.</p><p>I’m not saying that we shouldn’t encourage people to join Mastodon and other services and support them to make their services better. I’m just saying it won’t cut it. Not by a long shot.</p><p>Like with all monopolies, this is a case where the free market doesn’t automatically lead to the best outcome.</p><p>My suggestion is the following: <strong>Make it illegal for social media companies to have closed and decentralized networks after a certain size.</strong> The size is up to debate, but I think it should be measured by active users.</p><p>For example, all companies that have more than 50 million monthly active users need to open up and decentralize their protocol or use an existing one.</p><p>There are already a bunch of anti-trust laws that regulate monopolies and concentration of market power. Why not revise and extend them to take into consideration today’s business and technology landscape?</p></article></div>]]>

<li>You hire a <a href="https://orbastro.com/flat-sat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> flat-sat </a> to design/program your payload for compatibility with the platform.</li>
<li>Once ready, you pull the trigger for platform build and pay the remaining fee.</li>
<li>Once the platform is built (nominally 1 month later), you come on-site and integrate your payload with assistance from our engineers.

<li>Whilst you are on-site, we put the fully integrated satellite through fight-acceptance testing. This should not take more than 2-3 days after your payload has been integrated.</li>

<p><strong> £60,000 baseline </strong></p>
<p>The price includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A fully assembled 3U satellite platform</li>
<li>Engineering support with payload integration, on-site with us</li>
<li>Full flight-acceptance testing and associated health-checks, on-site with us</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently building a batch-production facility for this product-line. As such, 3U satellite platforms will only become commercially available from May-21 onwards. Nominal lead-time for production of platforms will be 1 month*. Between now and then, OrbAstro will be taking deposits that will secure customers in the production queue and will freeze their price point to the “early adopter rate”.</p>
<p><strong> Deposits are £1,000 per satellite. Deposits are fully refundable. </strong></p>
<p>The current price is what we are calling the “early adopter rate”. Though OrbAstro still makes a reasonable margin at the “early adopter rate” price, it will go up over the period of 2022 as the platform gains more heritage and becomes an established solution. The next nearest alternative to OrbAstro will not be able to provide a similar solution for anything less than £500,000 over the coming few years. And though OrbAstro is looking to lower the barrier for entry to enable the emergence of new space markets and the flourishing of existing markets, this vision must be balanced against the company financing other longer-term activities aligned with <strong> lowering it further </strong> .</p>
<p><em> *Depending on demand, it could take OrbAstro ~6 months to match supply/demand requirements to stabilise at a 1-month production lead-time. As such, if you are looking to launch in 2021-2022, place your deposit now. </em></p>

<p>The first ORB-3 satellite platform with a commercial payload onboard is launching in Q2 2021 on a SpaceX Falcon 9. It will have all of the standard subsystems listed. Additionally, it will have deployable solar panels, both Telos-10 and Telos-40, and both S-band transceiver &amp; Ka-band transmitter + antennas. OrbAstro currently has subsequent platforms booked for launch in late-2021 and mid-2022, both 6U variants (ORB-6). For the most part, subsystems on the 3U platforms are identical to those on the 6U platforms. The OrbAstro team has a long history of developing complex satellite subsystems, from concept to orbital operations.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://emergent.systems/posts/devtools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://emergent.systems/posts/devtools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>We have a lot of tools at our disposal when programming for the web. Shells, editors,
IDEs, emulators, simulators, browsers and their associated dev tools, compilers,
version control systems like GIT, build tools like webpack, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A common pitfall is to learn just enough of these tools to get by. We can end up
using a shallow subset of these tools features like proverbial hammers rendering
many problems nails. This can make day to day development <strong>alot harder</strong> than
it needs to be.</p>
<p>You will spend a lot of time with these tools during your programming career.
It’s worth getting to know them well. In this post I’ll share some features of
Chrome DevTools you may not be aware of that I’ve found to be most useful in day
to day hacking on thick client apps.</p>
<p>So with that said grab that flux capacitor. Where we’re going we don’t need
console.log!</p>
<h2>Console Utilities</h2>
<p>Most folks are familiar with accessing browser globals <code>window</code> and <code>document</code>
from the console pane but you might not be aware Chrome DevTools ships with a
bunch of console utilities alongside these. Here’s a couple worth knowing.</p>
<h3>$0 and friends</h3>
<p>Say we want to obtain a reference to a particular DOM Element in the console so
we can interact with it. There are a few common ways people tend to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a DOM method from the console like <code>document.querySelector(selector)</code></li>
<li>Use <code>$(selector)</code> which is an alias for <code>document.querySelector</code>.</li>
<li>Right click on an element from the Elements pane and select “store as
global variable”.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another way that proves a lot more useful particularly when your
debugging concerns multiple elements. Meet <code>$0</code> and it’s friends <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <code>$3</code>,
<code>$4</code>. These are special references in the console that point to the last
5 elements selected in the Elements Panel.</p>
<p>Right click a webpage and choose “Inspect Element”. Now navigate to
the console tab of dev tools drawer and type <code>$0</code> and hit Enter.</p>
<p>You should see the element you selected logged to the console.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/$0.png" alt="$0" loading="lazy"></p>
<h3>The events must flow: monitorEvents</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to be able to see what events a particular DOM Element is
recieving as you interact with a web page?</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve attached some event handlers but things aren’t being triggered as
you expect so you need a closer look. Sure you could throw in a <code>console.log</code>
into the event listener code but that just works for one event handler and
it also involves adding and removing code in order to debug things. Laborious!</p>
<p>The <code>monitorEvents</code> API of chrome dev tools allows you to see all events that
are recieved by any DOM Element as you interact with the page without adding any
additional app code. Let’s try it out.</p>
<p>Open the Elements pane and select the element you wish to monitor for events.</p>
<p>Now we are going to use our special <code>$0</code> reference we learned earlier to pass a
reference to the DOM Element we want to observe. Go to the console and type
<code>monitorEvents($0)</code>.</p>
<p>Calling <code>monitorEvents</code> with a single argument will monitor <em>all</em> events for
that Element. We can also specify the exact event we want to monitor by
supplying a second argument: <code>monitorEvents($0, 'click')</code>.</p>
<p>Hit Enter to invoke the <code>monitorEvents</code> function and then interact with the DOM
Element you chose to monitor in the web page. You should now see a stream of
events received by the Element you are monitoring logged to the console.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/monitor-events.png" alt="Monitor Events" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2>The Command Menu</h2>
<p>The command menu is a faster way to navigate the DevTools UI and accomplish
many common tasks without having to leave your keyboard.</p>
<p>With DevTools open, you can open the command menu on Mac by pressing
<code>Command+Shift+P</code>.</p>
<p>You should now see the command menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/command-menu.png" alt="Command Menu" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The available commands are segmented in to various categories like Network,
Debugger, Rendering etc. and you can leverage the menu fuzzy search to find the
one you want quicker.</p>
<p>Take a moment to scroll through the list and get an idea of the commands
available.</p>
<h2>The DevTools Drawer</h2>
<p>DevTools provides access to it’s 9 main panes (Elements, Console, Sources etc.)
via tabs at the top of the DevTools window.</p>
<p>You’d be forgiven for not knowing that there is an additional set of 19 panes
hidden away in what’s called the DevTools <em>Drawer</em>. You can find them by
clicking the three dots on the right of the main DevTools Tab Bar and
selecting “More Tools” from the menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/drawer-menu.png" alt="Drawer" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at a couple of my favourite Drawer panes.</p>
<h3>The Coverage Pane: Optimising Performance At Build-time.</h3>
<p>The code coverage pane allows you to analyze how much CSS and JS code was
loaded versus how much was <em>used</em>. This helps to identify possible <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">code splitting</a>
opportunities in order to optimise our build and only load stuff a
user actually needs at a given time.</p>

<p>Lets perform a quick analysis. Navigate to any webpage, open the DevTools,
launch the Command Menu and type “coverage”. You should see a “Show Coverage”
command:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/coverage-drawer-command.png" alt="Coverage Drawer Command" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Hit enter and you should see a new drawer tab labelled “Coverage” and its
corresponding pane should be visible:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/coverage-drawer.png" alt="Coverage Drawer" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Click the reload button. This will instrument the CSS and JS code on the page
and reload it producing a coverage report:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/coverage-report.png" alt="Coverage Report" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>leverage <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering">network
throttling</a>
to simulate differing network conditions.</p>
<h3>Performance Monitor: Optimising Performance At Runtime.</h3>
<p>In terms of CPU/RAM, it’s safe to say developers are generally asymmetrically
much better off than the average user of apps being built with high end development
machines.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised if you get hit with a bug report out of the blue one day
complaining that your site is slow. Maybe it’s a memory leak. Maybe you are triggering
too many reflows and the CPU is getting maxed out. <strong>Web perf is hard</strong> and
there are many possible causes for performance issues. For that reason, it’s
useful to get an initial view at 50,000 ft. so that you can appropriately narrow
the scope of your debugging efforts.</p>
<p>The Performance Monitor drawer pane allows us to easily see some high level
runtime performance metrics like CPU usage, JS Heap Allocations and more.</p>
<p>Again the the easiest way to bring up the performance monitor is via the
Commmand Menu. Open it and type “Show Performance Monitor” and hit Enter. You
should now see a new Drawer pane tracking key perf metrics over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/performance-monitor.png" alt="Performance Monitor" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>leverage <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/07/devtools-release-notes#throttling">cpu throttling</a>
to see how your site performs on less powerful devices.</p>
<h3>Script Blackboxing</h3>
<p>More often that not, when working with the JS debugger you are more interested
in your own application code rather than any 3rd party code that is being
executed.</p>
<p><em>Script Blackboxing</em> is way to ignore specific files while debugging. When a
script is blackboxed, it won’t appear in the Call Stack pane and even better,
when stepping through code, the blackboxed scripts will be skipped.</p>
<p>The best way to blackbox scripts is via the Settings pane. Open DevTools and
click the cog on the far right to open the settings and select “blackbox”. Here
you can add a pattern to blackbox any scripts you wish to ignore when debugging!</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/script-blackboxing.png" alt="Script Blackboxing" loading="lazy"></p>
<h3>Local Overrides</h3>
<p>Local overrides are a way to persist changes you make to your code via
DevTools and have them persist across page reloads. This feature is particularly
handy when collaborating with designers to make UI tweaks on the fly.</p>
<p>To enable local overrides, open the DevTools and select the Sources tab. Select
Overrides from the sub menu and click “Select folder for overrides” to choose a
directory where DevTools can persist your changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/overrides.png" alt="Overrides" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>With overrides enabled, DevTools will now serve any local modified files rather
than the original resources.</p>
<p>Give it a shot. Change a CSS property via the Styles sub-menu of the Elements pane
and refresh the page. You should see your change persist across page reloads.</p>
<p>Chrome also gives you a way to easily track these changes. Open the Command Menu
and search for “Changes” hit enter on the “Show Changes” Drawer menu item.</p>
<p><img src="https://emergent.systems/static/img/changes.png" alt="Overrides" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Hopefully some of these DevTool features are new to you. If so I encourage you
to try incorporating them in to your day to day development workflow. It will
take time to build some new muscle memories but sometimes you gotta go slow
to go fast!</p>

  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.1.1
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS &gt; New-ModuleManifest -Path mymodule/mymodule.psd1 -ModuleVersion "0.0.1" -Author "YourNameHere"
</code></pre><p>We have created the structure of the module. Now, let’s do a function called <code>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</code> containing the above script.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psm1</span>

<span>New-Alias</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>"ls3"</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span><span>(</span><span>$Path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>$Path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  		<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now edit our <em>mymodule.psd1</em> manifest file to add our function and alias for export. Find these two variables and edit them as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psd1</span>
<span>$FunctionsToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles'</span><span>)</span>
<span>$AliasesToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'ls3'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now copy our module folder <code>mymodule</code> to the following path (for all users) <code>/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules</code> or <code>~/.local/share/powershell/Modules</code> (for your user), and open new powershell session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ls3</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="most-used-modules">Most used modules</h2>
<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Alerting is part of every monitoring solution, but have you ever looked at alerts as time series? By doing so an ocean of opportunities opens.</p><article>
      
<p>If you have ever set up a system for monitoring another system, you know comes a time when you can no longer stare at dashboards to ensure your system is behaving properly. <strong>That time is when you need to set up alerting so you can wake up your teammates in the middle of the night.</strong></p>



<p>Alerts come in different shapes, colors, and sizes. At SenX we strongly believe alerts are nothing more than time series with a notification mechanism to alter your sleep pattern. This post will walk you through alerts as we implement them on top of <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp&nbsp;10</a> to provide notifications about anomalies on industrial equipment or on IT infrastructure.</p>



<h2>Alerts as Time Series</h2>



<p>When you see the world as time series as we do, alerts appear as simple series of boolean values, with <code>true</code> meaning that the alerting condition is met and <code>false</code> or the absence of value that it is not. The meaning and complexity of the underlying condition are very flexible. It could be a simple threshold that is passed, a diversion from a previous trend, a detected anomaly, or any other thing you might think of.</p>



<p><strong>Treating alerts as time series means to periodically assess those conditions and, depending on the outcome, to insert boolean values in a set of time series.</strong> Those series will accrue values and give you a very good understanding of your systems.</p>

<p>The example above shows alert series related to a subsystem of a complex infrastructure over a period of several months.</p>



<h4>By just looking at those series you can see some very interesting things:</h4>



<p>At <strong>(1)</strong> you can see that many alerts are triggered at the same time. This means that some events impacted multiple systems, in the present case, network outages which caused several services to fail.</p>



<p>Then at <strong>(2)</strong> we see sporadic alerts, single values here and there, meaning that a condition was evaluated to <code>true</code> in an isolated manner. Most of the time these lonely alerts are due to metrics which arrive late and therefore lead to a condition evaluation based on data which does not reflect reality. If this type of alerts repeats itself too often it might be time to tune your metric collection system.</p>



<p>At <strong>(3)</strong> we see a high density of alerts, this happens when the root cause of the alerts is not dealt with rapidly, the condition keeps on evaluate to <code>true</code> and therefore values keep being added to the alert time series. If you see too many of those you might need to talk to your on-call team. They are not acting fast enough or the issues they faces were complex to resolve.</p>



<p>Finally, at <strong>(4)</strong>, you see three alerts which are triggered almost always at the same time, this either means that some of them are not useful or that a component has an impact on several, a little like in case<strong> (1)</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Another benefit of treating alerts as time series is that you can easily test out new alerting conditions by running the condition on past metrics values and see how often alerts would be triggered.</strong> You could then assess if the new condition would have generated more or less alerts than the current one, and you could see if known incidents could have been detected earlier or not.</p>



<p><strong>You see, by treating alerts as time series you can learn a lot about the systems you supervise, and believe it or not, no notification was involved.</strong></p>



<h2>Alerts and notifications are two different beasts</h2>



<p>This is probably not what you thought up to now, but once you think about alerts as time series, notifications are simply here to warn you about the current situation, they are not the alerts themselves. <strong>So it is very important that when you design your supervision stack you clearly separate the notification step from the condition assessments which will lead to values in the alert time series.</strong></p>



<p>If notifications and alert conditions are too much entangled, you will have a hard time setting up efficient alerts. You will reason about the messenger (the email, page, or phone call you receive in the middle of the night) and not about the message itself.</p>



<p>Notifications should have a flexibility of their own, meaning that different target groups should decide to receive notifications, based on differing interpretations of the alert time series. Some teams might want to get paged when alerts outside their direct concern become too dense because they might indicate a worsening situation which may need their intervention, and ultimately may require they add new alerts themselves.</p>



<h2>Alerts in Warp&nbsp;10</h2>



<p>We have been using Warp&nbsp;10 for alerting for a long time. As a matter of fact, we monitor our own WarpCloud hosted platform using other instances of Warp&nbsp;10. And alerting and notifications are entirely handled in WarpScript. </p>



<p>So we will focus in the rest of this article on the alerting part done in Warp&nbsp;10. </p>



<p>For notifications, we will cover how to leverage external tools. The notification mechanisms available in Warp&nbsp;10 itself will be covered in another post.</p>



<h3>Configuration</h3>



<p>Over the years we have crafted macros which help us create and manage alerts. Those macros are now Open Source (AGPL) and available on SenX' <a href="https://warpfleet.senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WarpFleet</a> repository. This repository is configured by default in <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-release-2-7-0-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh Warp&nbsp;10 installs</a> so you most probably won't have to add it.</p>



<p>In order for these macros to operate properly, they need to have access to a write and a read token. Those tokens should be <a href="https://blog.senx.io/thinking-in-warpscript-protecting-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defined in your configuration</a> under the following keys:</p>



<pre><code>alerting-write-token@senx/alerting = YOUR_WRITE_TOKEN
alerting-read-token@senx/alerting = YOUR_READ_TOKEN</code></pre>



<p>Once those configs have been added, restart your Warp&nbsp;10 instance. It will then be ready to use the alerting macros, and you can run the examples which appear in the rest of this post.</p>



<h3>How are alerts stored?</h3>



<p>The alerting macros will use the tokens provided in the configuration to store and read Geo Time Series (GTS) containing the alerts.</p>



<p>They manage two sets of GTS, the first one is <em>alerts</em> GTS which use <code>alert</code> as their class name. These series contain boolean values, actually, mainly <code>true</code> values, indicating whether an alert condition is met or not. The second set of series contains <em>events</em> series which keep track of the actions performed by the alerting macros. These series use the <code>alert.events</code> class name. Both sets of series use labels to identify alerts. </p>



<p>Those labels should contain elements which add context about the systems subject of the alerts (device id, rack, engine number, data center, ...) but not to the actual alert beyond its name. </p>



<p>For example, if you are triggering an alert because the equipment is experiencing extreme vibrations, you should not include the precise level of vibration in the labels. There are some macros to add that type of context to an alert.</p>



<h3>Triggering an alert</h3>



<p>You collect data points in various series which represent the state of systems you supervise, whether industrial or IT. Periodically you run macros which perform computations on those series to check various conditions. When a specific condition is met, you want to trigger an alert named <code>cond.1</code> to record this fact.</p>



<p>In your script, you would call the macro <code>@senx/alerting/trigger</code> with a map containing the labels you want to attach to the alert. Remember, those labels will end up as the labels of the series tracking the condition. </p>



<p>In the following example, we set three labels, <code>name</code> with the name of the alert, <code>equipment</code> with the id of the equipment experiencing this condition and <code>factory</code> with the reference of the factory where the equipment is located. These latter two information were probably retrieved from the labels of the series on which the computation was performed. The code to trigger the alert would then be:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'name' 'cond.1'
  'factory' 'factory.A'
  'equipment' '12B27-3'
} @senx/alerting/trigger</code></pre>



<p>That is all there is to it. This will create an entry in the series <code>alert.events{name=cond.1,factory=factory.A,equipment=12B27-3}</code> indicating a <code>TRIGGER</code> action was performed, and a <code>true</code> value will appear in series <code>alert{name=cond.1,factory=factory.A,equipment=12B27-3}</code>, both at the same current timestamp.</p>



<h3>Retrieving alerts</h3>



<p>The alerts created via <code>@senx/alerting/trigger</code> can be retrieved either via a regular <code><a href="https://warp10.io/doc/FETCH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FETCH</a></code> call with the appropriate token or more directly via the macro @senx/alerting/fetch. This macro expects a map of labels, an end timestamp, and a duration.</p>



<p>To retrieve all alerts related to<code> factory.A</code> during the last 24  hours simply execute the following:</p>



<pre><code>{
  'factory' 'factory.A'
}
NOW
24 h
@senx/alerting/fetch</code></pre>



<p>This will retrieve the data points of the last 24 hours for both the <code>alert</code> and <code>alert.events</code> series with label <code>factory</code> set to <code>factory.A</code>.</p>



<h3>Splitting alerts</h3>



<p>When alerts are triggered, it is rare that only a single value gets written to the <code>alert</code> series. Usually, the condition triggering the alert is met during several consecutive time intervals at which it is computed.</p>



<p>This leads to <em>blocks</em> of <code>true</code> values in the <code>alert</code> Geo Time Series, each block can be considered a separate occurrence of the actual alert, and it is therefore, useful to be able to isolate each of those occurrences.</p>



<p>This is done quite easily in WarpScript using the <code><a href="https://warp10.io/doc/TIMESPLIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIMESPLIT</a></code> function which will split a GTS in multiple sub GTS based on <em>quiet</em> periods where no values exist in the GTS. So for example, if you consider that blocks of values separated by more than 30 minutes are separate occurrences of the alert, you can use the following WarpScript code to isolate each occurrence:</p>



<pre><code>// We consider 'alert' series to be in variable $alerts
$alerts
30 m   // Consider 30 minute quiet periods
2      // Consider blocks with at least 2 values
'occ'  // Add a label 'occ' with the sequence number of each block
TIMESPLIT</code></pre>



<p>The result will be a list of lists, one for each alert, containing one Geo Time Series per occurrence of each alert.</p>

    <div>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I started working on getting Racket CS to
compile and run on iOS and, with a lot of guidance from Matthew Flatt,
I managed to get it working (with some <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/351c0047d6371e36cf422b4627e020d14e8853fe/racket/src/ChezScheme/c/segment.c#L578-L587">caveats</a>).  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3607">Those
changes</a> have now been merged, so I figured I’d write another <a href="https://defn.io/2020/01/05/racket-on-ios/">one
of these guides</a> while the information is still fresh in my head.</p>
<h2 id="compile-racket-for-macos-and-for-ios">Compile Racket for macOS and for iOS</h2>
<p>You need a recent version of Racket and it’s associated fork of Chez
Scheme built for your host machine in order to cross-compile things.
To build both of them, clone the <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket">Racket repository</a> and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/08fa24304ebf80a21ade32e8e59bb51b27af1dae/build.md#1-building-racket-from-source">build instructions</a>.  If you use the default <code>make</code> target, then
you’ll end up with a host Racket installation overlayed on top of the
<code>racket/</code> directory in the repository and with a build of Chez Scheme
at <code>racket/src/build/cs/c/</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you can cross-compile Racket CS for iOS by making a new build
directory within <code>racket/src/</code> and configuring a cross build by
specifying a custom prefix (so that the <code>make install</code> step won’t
overwrite the host Racket installation), the target <code>host</code>
architecture, a path to the iOS SDK (or the shorthand name “iPhoneOS”)
and the paths to the host Racket and Chez Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-xcode-project">Set up your XCode project</h2>
<p>To link against and use Racket CS within an XCode project, copy
<code>racketcs.h</code>, <code>racketcsboot.h</code> and <code>chezscheme.h</code> from
<code>racket-ios/include/</code> into a sub-directory of your project, then add
that sub-directory to the “Header Search Paths” section under your
project’s “Build Settings” tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-headers.png" alt="Headers"></p>
<p>Then, disable Bitcode from the same section.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-bitcode.png" alt="Bitcode"></p>
<p>Next, copy <code>libracketcs.a</code>, <code>petite.boot</code>, <code>scheme.boot</code> and
<code>racket.boot</code> from <code>racket-ios/lib</code> into a sub-directory of your
project called <code>vendor/</code> and drag-and-drop the <code>vendor/</code> directory
into your XCode project.  Then, instruct XCode to link <code>libracketcs.a</code>
and <code>libiconv.tbd</code> with your code from the “Build Phases” tab.  You’ll
have to add <code>libracketcs.a</code> to your project using the “Add Other…”
sub-menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://defn.io/img/racket-cs-on-ios-link.png" alt="Link"></p>
<p>Next, add a new C source file called <code>vendor.c</code> and answer “yes” if
prompted to create a bridging header for Swift.  I tend to re-name the
bridging header to plain <code>bridge.h</code> because I don’t like the name that
XCode generates by default.  If you do this, you’ll have to update the
“Objective-C Bridging Header” setting in your “Build Settings” tab.
From <code>bridge.h</code>, include <code>vendor.h</code> and inside <code>vendor.h</code> add

  <p>
    Linux being secure is a common misconception in the security and privacy realm. Linux is thought to be secure primarily
    because of its source model, popular usage in servers, small userbase and confusion about its security features. This
    article is intended to debunk these misunderstandings. Due to inevitable pedanticism, "Linux" in this article refers
    to a standard desktop Linux or GNU/Linux distribution.
  </p>

  <h2 id="sandboxing"><a href="#sandboxing">Sandboxing</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    There is no strong sandboxing in the standard Linux desktop. This means that all applications have access to each other’s data
    and can snoop on your personal information. Linux still follows the <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2010/08/ms-dos-security-model.html">MS-DOS security model</a> — any malicious
    application you install or an RCE vulnerability in a benevolent application can result in the attacker instantly gaining
    access to your data. </p><p>
    
    This is in contrast to other desktop operating systems such as macOS or Windows 10 which have already put considerable effort into
    sandboxing applications. macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox">requires that all applications
    are sandboxed</a>. Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/intro-to-secure-windows-app-development#41-windows-app-model">
    automatically sandboxes UWP applications</a> and provides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview">Windows Sandbox
    utility</a> for non-UWP applications.
  </p></div>

  <h3 id="flatpak"><a href="#flatpak">Flatpak</a></h3>

  <div><p>
    Flatpak aims to sandbox applications, but <a href="https://flatkill.org/">its sandboxing is very flawed</a>. It fully
    trusts the applications and allows them to specify their own policy. This means security is optional and apps can
    just choose not to be sufficiently sandboxed. </p><p>
    
    Flatpak's permissions are also far too broad to be meaningful. For example, many applications come with
    <code>filesystem=home</code> which is read-write access to the user's home directory, giving access to all of your
    personal files and allowing trivial escapes via writing to <code>~/.bashrc</code> or similar. </p><p>
    
    Another example of Flatpak's broad permissions is how it allows unfiltered access to the X11 socket, allowing easy
    escapes due to X11's lack of GUI isolation. Adding X11 sandboxing via a nested X11 server such as Xpra is easy but
    <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2015/02/17/first-fully-sandboxed-linux-desktop-app/">Flatpak developers refuse
    to acknowledge this and continue to claim, "X11 is impossible to secure"</a>. </p><p>
    
    Even more examples of this is how Flatpak gives full access to directories such as <code>/sys</code> or
    <code>/proc</code> (kernel interfaces known for information leaks). </p><p>
    
    <i>Another</i> example is how the seccomp filter <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/f687f6b2ebfe9bc69f59e42bb96475ca01f08548/common/flatpak-run.c#L2646-L2693">
    only blacklists ~20 syscalls</a> which still exposes significant kernel attack surface.
  </p></div>

  <h3 id="firejail"><a href="#firejail">Firejail</a></h3>

  <p>
    Firejail also aims to sandbox applications but is, again, uneffective. If anything, it worsens security by acting as a
    privilege escalation hole. Firejail requires being SUID root, meaning it executes with the privileges of the root user.
    This could be acceptable if Firejail followed good security practices but, unfortunately, they do not. Firejail has too
    large attack surface which has resulted in <a href="https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/25">many</a> <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=16191&amp;product_id=0&amp;version_id=0&amp;page=1">vulnerabilities</a>
    in the past. <a href="https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/issues/3046">There are more details in this thread</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="exploit-mitigations"><a href="#exploit-mitigations">Exploit Mitigations</a></h2>

  

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_integrity">Control-Flow Integrity</a> is an exploit mitigation that aims to prevent
      code reuse attacks like ROP or JOP. A large portion of vulnerabilities are exploited using these techniques due to mitigations like NX
      making older techniques obsolete. On Linux, CFI is practically non-existent outside of Chromium whereas
      Windows has their own coarse-grained, forward-edge CFI implementation, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard">Control Flow Guard</a> (CFG) as well as <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815">
      Intel CET shadow stacks for backward-edge protection</a>. While CFG is only coarse-grained, Microsoft are <a href="https://connormcgarr.github.io/examining-xfg/">working on making it more fine-grained</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      A very basic exploit technique is simply to find a way to execute the attackers own malicious code either by loading
      a malicious library on disk or by dynamically modifying executable code in memory. Linux has yet to provide strong mitigations
      against this while Windows has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/02/23/mitigating-arbitrary-native-code-execution/">
      Arbitrary Code Guard and Code Integrity Guard</a> to enforce strict W^X and mitigate this avenue of attacks. SELinux does provide
      the <code>execmem</code> boolean, however this is rarely ever used. There is also the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1562410493-8661-1-git-send-email-s.mesoraca16@gmail.com/">S.A.R.A. LSM</a> but this is yet to
      be accepted upstream.
    </li>

    <li>
      One of the most common memory corruption vulnerabilities is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninitialized_variable">
      uninitialized memory</a>. Windows <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/05/13/solving-uninitialized-stack-memory-on-windows/">
      uses InitAll</a> to automatically initialize stack variables to zero for the kernel and some user space code as well as <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/07/02/solving-uninitialized-kernel-pool-memory-on-windows/">safer APIs for the kernel pool</a>
      whereas the solution in Linux is... nothing. There are some mitigations for kernel memory specifically but this doesn't cover
      any user space code and good luck finding a mainstream distribution that actually enables them.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">Kernel</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    The kernel is also very lacking in security. It is a monolithic kernel, meaning it contains a colossal amount of code all within
    the most privileged part of the operating system. The kernel has huge attack surface and is constantly adding new and dangerous features.
    The Linux kernel is equivalent to running all user space code as root in PID 1. </p><p>
    
    One example of these features is <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">eBPF</a>. In a nutshell, eBPF is a framework within the
    Linux kernel that allows <i>unprivileged</i> user space to execute arbitrary code within the kernel for increased performance. eBPF
    also includes a JIT compiler which is fundamentally a W^X violation and opens up the possibility of JIT spraying. The kernel does perform
    a number of checks on the code that is executed but even then, this feature <a href="https://ricklarabee.blogspot.com/2018/07/ebpf-and-analysis-of-get-rekt-linux.html">has</a> <a href="https://nitter.net/spendergrsec/status/1244703091037024257">still</a> <a href="https://nitter.net/bleidl/status/943714277403357185">caused</a> <a href="https://scannell.me/fuzzing-for-ebpf-jit-bugs-in-the-linux-kernel/">numerous</a> <a href="https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification">security</a>
    <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-ebpf.c">vulnerabilities</a>. </p><p>
    
    Another example of these features is <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user namespaces</a>.
    User namespaces allow unprivileged users to interact with lots of kernel code that is normally reserved for the root user. It adds a
    massive amount of networking, mount, etc. functionality as new attack surface. It has also been the cause of <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-February/043066.html">numerous</a> <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-general/2017-February/043078.html">privilege</a> <a href="https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check#questions-and-answers">escalation</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/subgraph/oz/issues/11#issuecomment-163396758">vulnerabilities</a> which is why many distributions <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/blob/master/debian/patches/debian/add-sysctl-to-disallow-unprivileged-CLONE_NEWUSER-by-default.patch">
    such as Debian</a> have started to restrict it by default. The endless stream of vulnerabilities
    arising from this feature shows no sign of stopping either even after years since its introduction. </p><p>
    
    The kernel is written entirely in a memory unsafe language and has hundreds of bugs, many being security vulnerabilities, <a href="https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf">discovered
    each <i>month</i></a>. In fact, there are so many bugs being found in the kernel, developers can’t keep up which
    results in many of the bugs <a href="https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream">staying unfixed for a long time</a>.
    <a href="https://jon.oberheide.org/files/syscan12-exploitinglinux.pdf">The kernel is decades behind in exploit
    mitigations</a> and many kernel developers simply <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/">do not
    care enough</a>. </p><p>
    
    Other kernels such as the  Windows and macOS kernels are somewhat similar too in that they are also large and bloated monolithic kernels with huge
    attack surface but they at least realise that these issues exist and take further steps to mitigate them.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="root"><a href="#root">The Non-Existent Boundary of Root</a></h2>

  <p>
    On ordinary desktops, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Strong_Linux_User_Account_Isolation">a compromised non-root user account with access
    to <code>sudo</code> is almost equal to full root compromise</a> as there are too many ways for an attacker to retrieve the
    sudo password. Usually, the standard user is part of group <code>sudo</code> which makes this a massive issue and makes a
    sudo password security theater. For example, the attacker can exploit the plethora of keylogging opportunities such as <a href="https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2011/04/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html">Xorg’s lack of GUI
      isolation</a>, the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/11/05/3">many infoleaks in
      <code>/proc</code></a>, using <a href="https://github.com/Aishou/wayland-keylogger"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to hook
      into every process</a> and so much more. Even if we mitigate every single way to log keystrokes, the attacker can
    just setup their own fake sudo program to grab the user password.
  </p>

  <h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>

  <p>
    This is all it takes to get your <code>sudo</code> password:
  </p>

  <pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;\EOF &gt; /tmp/sudo
#!/bin/bash
if [[ "${@}" = "" ]]; then
  /usr/bin/sudo
else
  read -s -r -p "[sudo] password for ${USER}: " password
  echo "${password}" &gt; /tmp/password
  echo -e "\nSorry, try again."
  /usr/bin/sudo ${@}
fi
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/sudo
export PATH="/tmp:${PATH}"</code></pre>

  <p>
    Or:
  </p>

  <pre><code>xinput list # find your keyboard ID
xinput test id # replace "id" with the ID from the above command</code></pre>

  <div><p>
    etc. </p><p>
    
    Now the attacker is just a <code>modprobe</code> away from full kernel privileges. </p><p>
    
    An attacker can also trivially setup a session-wide rootkit via <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> or similar variables:
  </p></div>

  <pre><code>echo "LD_PRELOAD=\"/path/to/malicious_library\"" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

  <div><p>
    This technique is quite common and is used in the majority of user space rootkits. A few examples are <a href="https://github.com/chokepoint/azazel">azazel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/chokepoint/Jynx2">Jynx2</a>
    and <a href="https://www.intezer.com/blog/linux/hiddenwasp-malware-targeting-linux-systems/">HiddenWasp</a>. </p><p>
    
    These are just a few examples and they don't even require exploiting bugs.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="distro-specific-issues"><a href="#distro-specific-issues">Distribution-Specific Issues</a></h2>

  <h3 id="debian"><a href="#debian">Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS</a></h3>

  <div><p>
    Debian, among other distributions such as Ubuntu that freeze packages for a long time only ever backport security fixes
    that receive a CVE. However, this misses the majority of them. Most fixes do not receive CVEs because either the developer
    doesn’t care or because it’s not obvious whether or not a bug is exploitable at first. </p><p>
    
    Debian maintainers cannot analyze every single commit perfectly and backport every security fix. They have to rely on CVEs
    which people do not use properly. </p><p>
    
    For example, the Linux kernel is <a href="https://github.com/gregkh/presentation-cve-is-dead/blob/master/cve-linux-kernel.pdf">
    particularly</a>
    <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">bad</a> at this. Even when there is a CVE for the
    issue, sometimes fixes still aren't backported such as in the Debian Chromium package which is <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/chromium-browser-for-kicksecure-discussions-not-whonix/10388/49">still affected by many severe
    and public vulnerabilities, some of which are even being exploited in the wild</a>.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="hardening"><a href="#hardening">"But I harden my system!"</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Standard system hardening is not enough to fix any of these massive architectural security issues. Restricting a few
    minor things is not going to fix this. Likewise, a few common security features distributions deploy by default is also
    not going to fix this. Just because your distribution enables a MAC framework without creating a strict policy and still
    running most processes unconfined, doesn't mean you can escape from these. </p><p>

Linear models are amongst the simplest of models, but they are ubiquitous across science.
A linear model with Gaussian distributions on the coefficients forms one of the simplest instances of a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process">Gaussian process</a></em>.
In this post, we will give a brief introduction to linear models from a Gaussian process point of view.
We will see how a linear model can be implemented with <em>Gaussian process probabilistic programming</em> using <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/stheno">Stheno</a>, and how this model can be used to denoise noisy observations.
(Disclosure: <a href="https://willtebbutt.github.io/">Will Tebbutt</a> and Wessel are the authors of Stheno;
Will maintains a <a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl">Julia version</a>.)
In short, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming">probabilistic programming</a> is a programming paradigm that brings powerful probabilistic models to the comfort of your programming language, which often comes with tools to automatically perform inference (make predictions).
We will also use <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a>’s just-in-time compiler to make our implementation extremely efficient.</p>

<h2 id="linear-models-from-a-gaussian-process-point-of-view">Linear Models from a Gaussian Process Point of View</h2>

<p>Consider a data set \((x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n \subseteq \R \times \R\) consisting of \(n\) real-valued input–output pairs.
Suppose that we wish to estimate a linear relationship between the inputs and outputs:</p><p>

\[\label{eq:ax_b}
    y_i = a \cdot x_i + b + \e_i,\]

</p><p>where \(a\) is an unknown slope, \(b\) is an unknown offset, and \(\e_i\) is some error/noise associated with the observation \(y_i\).
To implement this model with Gaussian process probabilistic programming, we need to cast the problem into a <em>functional form</em>.
This means that we will assume that there is some underlying, random function \(y \colon \R \to \R\) such that the observations are evaluations of this function: \(y_i = y(x_i)\).
The model for the random function \(y\) will embody the structure of the linear model \eqref{eq:ax_b}.
This may sound hard, but it is not difficult at all.
We let the random function \(y\) be of the following form:</p><p>

\[\label{eq:ax_b_functional}
    y(x) = a(x) \cdot x + b(x) + \e(x)\]

</p><p>where \(a\colon \R \to \R\) is a <em>random constant function</em>.
An example of a <em>constant function</em> \(f\) is \(f(x) = 5\).
<em>Random</em> means that the value \(5\) is not fixed, but modelled with a random value drawn from some probability distribution, because we don’t know the true value.
We let \(b\colon \R \to \R\) also be a random <em>constant function</em>, and \(\e\colon \R \to \R\) a random <em>noise function</em>.
Do you see the similarities between \eqref{eq:ax_b} and \eqref{eq:ax_b_functional}?
If all that doesn’t fully make sense, don’t worry; things should become more clear as we implement the model.</p>

<p>To model random constant functions and random noise functions, we will use <a href="https://github.com/wesselb/stheno">Stheno</a>, which is a Python library for Gaussian process modelling.
We also have a <a href="https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl">Julia version</a>, but in this post we’ll use the Python version.
To install Stheno, run the command</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> <span>--upgrade</span> <span>--upgrade-strategy</span> eager stheno
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Stheno, a Gaussian process can be created with <code>GP(kernel)</code>, where <code>kernel</code> is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process#Covariance_functions"><em>kernel</em> or <em>covariance function</em> of the Gaussian process</a>.
The kernel determines the properties of the function that the Gaussian process models.
For example, the kernel <code>EQ()</code> models smooth functions, and the kernel <code>Matern12()</code> models functions that look jagged.
See the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/">kernel cookbook</a> for an overview of commonly used kernels and the <a href="https://wesselb.github.io/stheno/docs/_build/html/readme.html#available-kernels">documentation of Stheno</a> for the corresponding classes.
For constant functions, you can set the kernel to simply a constant, for example <code>1</code>, which then models the constant function with a value drawn from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\). (By default, in Stheno, all means are zero; but, if you like, <a href="https://wesselb.github.io/stheno/docs/_build/html/readme.html#available-means">you can also set a mean</a>.)</p>

<p>Let’s start out by creating a Gaussian process for the random constant function \(a(x)\) that models the slope.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>GP</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see how the Gaussian process looks by simply sampling from it.
To sample from the Gaussian process <code>a</code> at some inputs <code>x</code>, evaluate it at those inputs, <code>a(x)</code>, and call the method <code>sample</code>: <code>a(x).sample()</code>.
This shows that you can really think of a Gaussian process just like you think of a function:
pass it some inputs to get (the model for) the corresponding outputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>linspace</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/linear-models-constant-functions.png" alt="Samples of a Gaussian process that models a constant function">
Figure 1: Samples of a Gaussian process that models a constant function.</p>

<p>We’ve sampled a bunch of constant functions.
Sweet!
The next step in the model \eqref{eq:ax_b_functional} is to multiply the slope function \(a(x)\) by \(x\).
To multiply <code>a</code> by \(x\), we multiply <code>a</code> by the function <code>lambda x: x</code>, which casts also \(x\) as a function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>f</span>
<span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>lambda</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give rise to functions like \(x \mapsto 0.1x\) and \(x \mapsto -0.4x\), depending on the value that \(a(x)\) takes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>).</span><span>sample</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>));</span> <span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>show</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/linear-models-slope-functions.png" alt="Samples of a Gaussian process that models functions with a random slope">
Figure 2: Samples of a Gaussian process that models functions with a random slope.</p>

<p>This is starting to look good!
The only ingredient that is missing is an offset.
We model the offset just like the slope, but here we set the kernel to <code>10</code> instead of <code>1</code>, which models the offset with a value drawn from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 10)\).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>GP</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>

<p>Something went wrong.
Stheno has an abstraction called <em>measures</em>, where only <code>GP</code>s that are part of the same measure can be combined into new <code>GP</code>s;
the abstraction of measures is there to keep things safe and tidy.
What goes wrong here is that <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are not part of the same measure.
Let’s explicitly create a new measure and attach <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>Measure</span>

<p>Let’s see how samples from <code>f</code> look like.</p>

Figure 3: Samples of a Gaussian process that models linear functions.</p>

<p>Perfect!
We will use <code>f</code> as our linear model.</p>

<p>In practice, observations are corrupted with noise.
We can add some noise to the lines in Figure 3 by adding a Gaussian process that models noise.
You can construct such a Gaussian process by using the kernel <code>Delta()</code>, which models the noise with independent \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\) variables.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>Delta</span>

<p>That looks more realistic, but perhaps that’s a bit too much noise.
We can tune down the amount of noise, for example, by scaling <code>noise</code> by <code>0.5</code>.</p>

<p>We call a program like this a <em>Gaussian process probabilistic program</em> (GPPP).
Let’s generate some noisy synthetic data, <code>(x_obs, y_obs)</code>, that will make up an example data set \((x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n\).
We also save the observations without noise added—<code>f_obs</code>—so we can later check how good our predictions really are.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/linear-models-observations.png" alt="Some observations">
Figure 6: Some observations.</p>

<p>We will see next how we can fit our model to this data.</p>

<h2 id="inference-in-linear-models">Inference in Linear Models</h2>

<p>Suppose that we wish to remove the noise from the observations in Figure 6.
We carefully phrase this problem in terms of our GPPP:
the observations <code>y_obs</code> are realisations of the <em>noisy</em> linear model <code>y</code> at <code>x_obs</code>—realisations of <code>y(x_obs)</code>—and we wish to make predictions for the <em>noiseless</em> linear model <code>f</code> at <code>x_obs</code>—predictions for <code>f(x_obs)</code>.</p>

<p>In Stheno, we can make predictions based on observations by <em>conditioning</em> the measure of the model on the observations.
In our GPPP, the measure is given by <code>prior</code>, so we aim to condition <code>prior</code> on the observations <code>y_obs</code> for <code>y(x_obs)</code>.
Mathematically, this process of incorporating information by conditioning happens through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes’ rule</a>.
Programmatically, we first make an <code>Observations</code> object, which represents the information—the observations—that we want to incorporate, and then condition <code>prior</code> on this object:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>stheno</span> <span>import</span> <span>Observations</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>obs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Observations</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>(</span><span>x_obs</span><span>),</span> <span>y_obs</span><span>)</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>prior</span><span>.</span><span>condition</span><span>(</span><span>obs</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also more concisely perform these two steps at once, as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>prior</span> <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>y</span><span>(</span><span>x_obs</span><span>),</span> <span>y_obs</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This mimics the mathematical notation used for conditioning.</p>

<p>With our updated measure <code>post</code>, which is often called the <em>posterior</em> measure, we can make a prediction for <code>f(x_obs)</code> by passing <code>f(x_obs)</code> to <code>post</code>:</p>

	 <p>Like most SaaS-providers we charge in USD even though we are not based in USA. MakePlans is based in Norway and NOK is the currency of choice here (along with Brent crude oil of course). While we do have some expenses in USD most of our revenue would eventually end up in our Norwegian bank account in NOK. When using Stripe for card payments they will handle currency conversion when they pay out in your local currency. While doing this they charge a <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">2% currency conversion fee</a>. That is on top of their already high fees (2,9% for foreign cards here in Norway!).</p>

<h2 id="unavailable-options">Unavailable options</h2>

<p>Turns out avoiding Stripe currency conversion fees wasn’t that easy. Here are the options we investigated:</p>

<h3 id="use-a-local-usd-account">Use a local USD account</h3>

<p>From the start we assumed this could easily be solved by having a local USD account. Most bigger banks offer USD accounts and we could easily open one. There would be some incoming transfer fees payable to the bank but a lot less than the 2% Stripe charges.</p>

<p><em>But Stripe only supports USD payouts to bank accounts in USA and Canada.</em> So while we did some research here it was pointless as such an account could not be used for payouts from Stripe.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-a-local-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with a local bank</h3>

<p>Our next research mission was to open a bank account in the USA. The easiest would be using a local bank but going into the process we were informed that it was not allowed to open what they call a personal account. Even though this would be a business account this rule comes into action when the business is majority owned by one person. As is the case with MakePlans. And that person would not sell of half of the company just to get a bank account in USA.</p>

<h3 id="open-a-bank-account-in-the-usa-with-an-american-bank">Open a bank account in the USA with an American bank</h3>

<p>So as a European company this leaves us one option: open a bank account in USA. While starting a US company is a lot more complicated than starting a company here in Norway (can be done in less than 30 minutes including getting a bank account) there are options for opening up a company fairly smoothly. And no reason to follow all the Google search results - Stripe actually offers a way to this. It is called <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas">Stripe Atlas</a>. If you need a US company for other reason this seems like a good way to go. But it will mean that have all the obligations that comes with having another company and it being in USA. It will also complicate tax reporting in your company structure. So while some research was conducted here we quickly dismissed this idea and I don’t recommend it unless you need a US company for other reasons.</p>

<h2 id="enter-transferwise">Enter TransferWise</h2>

<p>I have used <a href="https://transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> a few times and it seems like a good option for money transfer and while I knew about their card offering I never really looked into too much as I was using Revolut when travelling to save on currency conversion fees for private usage. I guess it was around the time when Revolut launched their business offering I started looking into TransferWise Business. It got me excited but <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a> only offers a USD account in the UK, and as you already know now Stripe only supports payout in USD to accounts located in USA and Canada. TransferWise however do offer a USD account in USA. You will get a fully functional business bank account with routing and account number. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-it-up">How to set it up</h2>

<p>Getting instant 2% profit is quick and easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/i/espena8">Register for a TransferWise business account</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://transferwise.com/flows/open-balance#/">Open a USD balance in TransferWise</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the TransferWise USD bank account details in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts">Stripe dashboard ‘Payout settings’ section</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From now on all your USD charges will be paid out in USD and you will no longer pay any currency conversion fees to Stripe.</p>

<p>As a bonus you can use your shiny new TransferWise card and pay your expenses such as Heroku or Amazon directly in USD. Saving you even more in currency conversion fees as your local card usually will charge 2% as well. Double win!</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Free to open account.</li>
  <li>Free debit Mastercard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transfer of $1000 USD to Norwegian bank account by converting to NOK:</p>

<table>

      <th><strong>Method</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Variable fee</strong></th>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - dirty" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - keys before / after" width="1080" height="889" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-1024x843.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-624x514.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>

<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>

<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>

<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - side" width="1248" height="866" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362-1024x711.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-side-7362-624x433.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-3d440196438b8c552ee9"><div><p>One day, on my commute to work, I wondered – "How deep underground am I?" Escalators, stairs, lifts, mazes of tunnels… no idea. I searched the internet – a few people have done curiosity maps and played with Beck's design, so surely one of depths must exist. Trawling the internet, seeking to satiate my curiosity, I found nothing. So my curiosity turned into a mission – I would create these. I set on to research and got an excel sheet from TfL.</p><p>Taking a page from Beck's book, I couldn't represent distances between stations to scale, as that would have render most diagrams impractical. The only accurate scale would be that of depth. I  created the first diagram – the Victoria line, one of the simplest. Once I got on to the Central line I realised my approach had to change – some lines have different branches, and as the diagrams represent a unique path, I couldn't create a single diagram for the whole line.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-1248e73b2db85bb3239a"><div><p>The obvious solution at the time, it seemed, was for me to choose, within each specific Underground line, the minimal number of A-B journeys that would cover all of its stations. Creating the diagrams was time-consuming. So many numbers and calculations, double- and triple-checking. Once the diagrams were completed they didn't seem right – yes, I knew all the depths of the stations, but the way I'd displayed them didn't seem correct.</p><p>The answer arrived via the Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. These have so many different branches that you need to be certain of which service you get. And this was when the obvious dawned on me. Sure, lines branch out, but trains go from A-B. What the diagrams had to represent was not the lines but the services of these lines. So I checked all the services from all the lines (33 in total) and re-created the diagrams accordingly.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>

<p>Signal <em>may</em> be more private than WhatsApp, but if they ever want to rival their 2 billion users (yes, you read that correctly), then they’ll need a product that’s <strong>just as easy to use</strong>.</p>

<div data-id="7066953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

<div data-id="6777d1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

<p>The answer to that depends on a number of factors, one being how easy the experience of migrating from WhatsApp to Signal is. So let’s take a look.</p>

His data show that an <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/04/procrastination">estimated 20% of men and women</a> in the U.S. are chronic procrastinators. </p><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong> is a writer on the topic of productivity. He surveyed over two thousand professionals and found that <a href="https://medium.com/darius-foroux/how-common-is-procrastination-a-study-80869467c3f3">88% of them had procrastinated</a> for at least one hour on the previous day. The research is clear. Big or small, a little bit or habitual, procrastination is a problem that plagues productivity. </p><p>At Doit we help you get things done. If procrastination is getting in the way of doing your to-do list, this article is for you. This guide shares the surprising real reason we procrastinate, presents ideas to stop procrastinating and start doing <em>now</em>, and practices for getting out of the procrastination habit for good. Let’s do it.</p><h2 id="what-is-procrastination">What is Procrastination?</h2><p>Oxford Languages defines procrastination as “the act of postponing or delaying something.” That simple definition shows that procrastination is far reaching. It is not limited to school work or professional projects or personal obligations. Procrastination is omnipresent and can happen in every aspect of our lives.</p><p>College students are notorious procrastinators. Research papers and study sessions are put off until mere hours before the assignment is due or the test is administered. At work, professionals wait until the day before a big presentation to put together their speaking notes and infographics. Patients with anxiety about dental work put off seeing a dentist year after year until unavoidable pain pushes them to make an appointment.</p><p>The basic meaning leaves out an important aspect of procrastination illustrated by the examples above. When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing. &nbsp;A week before a deadline, we readily wander onto a social media feed or grab a snack or make a phone call to a friend. The day before that deadline, things look very different. We wait until we have no choice but to dive in and take care of the suddenly pressing problem, project, or task.</p><p>People who procrastinate are often mislabeled as lazy. Many of us even engage in self talk about how lazy or unfocused we are when we engage in procrastination. But procrastination is not a reflection of someone’s work ethic or their ability to focus. There’s more to it than that.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>When we procrastinate, we typically put off something that we find difficult, challenging, or uncomfortable in favor of something easier or more appealing.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Chronic procrastinators know that waiting will cause more harm than good. We know that this choice will ultimately lead to a worse outcome for us physically, emotionally, and otherwise, but we do it anyway. The Ancient Greeks called this state of mind “acrasia.” Our modern understanding of procrastination finds its roots in this bygone term, which means <strong>doing something “against your better judgement.” </strong></p><p>Why, oh why, would we put off the mere <em>potential</em> for pain today when we know with certainty it will cause worse suffering down the road? There are scientific theories behind that and they have nothing to do with work ethic or time management or motivation. The reasons are, surprisingly, rooted in our emotions.</p><h2 id="the-real-reason-we-procrastinate">The Real Reason We Procrastinate</h2><p>Dr. Fuschia Sirois is a professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield. She <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email">told The New York Times</a>, “It doesn’t make sense to do something you know is going to have negative consequences.” She added, “ “People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.”</p><p>Dr. Tim Pychyl is also a professor of psychology and a member of the Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Ottawa. He said, “Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem.” <a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91793/1/Compass%20Paper%20revision%20FINAL.pdf">Sirois and Pychyl teamed up in 2013</a> to research the notion that people place a priority on their immediate emotional needs over those of their future selves via procrastination. Here’s what they concluded.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>People engage in this irrational cycle of chronic procrastination because of an inability to manage negative moods around a task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>When faced with an “aversive” task, i.e. something that we find “boring, frustrating, lacking in meaning and/or structure,” we react with negative feelings and moods. Then we have a choice. We can get through those feelings and moods via “self-regulation” or we can succumb to the immediately protective choice of procrastination. Most of us choose the short-term solution. Avoiding the task gives us an emotional lift. We feel better. So we do it, or rather, <em>avoid doing it</em>, again and again. And before we know it, we are chronically procrastinating.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-procrastination">The Problem with Procrastination</h2><p>Sirois and Pychyl’s research shows that our future selves are paying a dear price for the short-term gratification we receive when we put things off. We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</p><p>We believe that when we sit down to work tomorrow, or next week, or next month before the big deadline, we will <em>feel</em> like doing it. But we are wrong. When we choose the temporary <a href="https://blog.doit.io/how-to-stay-focused-when-you-get-bored-working-toward-your-goals/">reprieve from boredom</a>, frustration, or challenge and kick the can down the road to our future selves, we are only making matters cumulatively worse.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>We aren’t dismissing our future selves as being unimportant or anything. We are just absolutely convinced that our future self will be better able to handle the given task.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For one thing, a constant current of anxiety and tension will be along for the entire procrastination ride. This nagging looming deadline will be churning in the background, coloring our daily mood and impacting our health and well being. The negative feelings we have about the task itself make us procrastinate. That, in turn, leads to ruminating negative thoughts about the act of procrastination itself. It’s a cycle that has a snowball effect, gathering more self blame, shame, anxiety, and stress along the way.</p><p>For another, when we finally decide it’s “go time,” our job is much more daunting than it was before. We now have to take on a monumental task instead of one that is simply boring or frustrating. We will be faced with cramming a month’s worth of work into just a day or two. We won’t eat right, we sure won’t sleep right, our stress levels will soar, and our minds and bodies will suffer as a result.</p><p>It’s like credit card debt. The bill is going to come due. We can pay the full balance now, which is going to put a dent in our immediate account. Or, we can allow it to grow bigger and bigger as the interest charges stack up, costing us way more every single step along the way. Chronic procrastinators put it all on credit and pay significantly more in the end.</p><h2 id="5-techniques-to-stop-procrastinating-today">5 Techniques to Stop Procrastinating Today</h2><p>When we think about breaking free from the bad habit of procrastination, we benefit from taking a multipronged approach. We have a better chance of succeeding when we look at short term, immediate techniques as well as changes we can make in the long run that will help us make chronic procrastination a permanent part of our past. First, let’s look at ways to find immediate relief from putting a task off so we can get going at getting it done. </p><h3 id="1-short-list">1. Short List</h3><p>There is a reason why to-do lists stand the test of time when it comes to organization and productivity. They work! This list technique is all about keeping it short and simple.</p><p>Make a list of 3-6 things that you want to get done during your next work period. Put them in <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-myth-of-multitasking/">order of the most important</a> or time sensitive to the least important or time sensitive. Start working on the first task until it is finished. Check it off, mark it out, and move to the next item. Keep going until your work session ends. Move any tasks that are left undone to the new list you will create for your next session.</p><p>The new list should also be put in priority order. Lower priority tasks that are not time sensitive may be copied over to the bottom spot from list to list for days or even weeks! Don’t beat yourself up about it. Just keep it on the list until you get to it.</p><p>A note on timing: Some people like to make their list at the end of the previous work day or session. If you tend to ruminate at night and lose sleep when a list is running through your mind, plan to make the list as soon as you enter your work space the next day instead.</p><h3 id="2-digitally-declutter">2. Digitally Declutter</h3><p>Let’s face it. Distractions are very easily found these days. If you tend to wander into social media or headline news or your personal inbox instead of working on the more pressing task at hand, it’s time to digitally declutter your workspace.</p><p>The idea here is to make it harder to get distracted by removing the devices that hold those distractions. So, let’s say you need to create an outline for an upcoming …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p><em>Guest Author</em>: <a href="https://github.com/sreekarsr">Sreekar</a></p>

<p>As part of a course on <a href="http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/uday/2019b-EE2025/index.html">Engineering Electromagnetics</a> in the Fall 2019 semester, we had to make a poster on a topic of our interest which involved electromagnetics, which we had to present at our department, on a fine Saturday afternoon (19.10.2019).</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">How did we come up with this topic?<a href="#how-did-we-come-up-with-this-topic">#</a></h2>

<p>With my exams of the course having gone really bad (I still have nightmares about it :( ), I was determined to make my group’s poster one of the best that will be put up on poster day. The three of us, Sreekar, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithin-varma-17ba3b174">Nithin Varma</a> and I searched the internet for a topic that was “unconventional” and interesting. After a week or so of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game">following links on Wikipedia</a>, I came across this article - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio)">Whistler (radio)</a>, which caught my eye. It was a topic that most would have not heard about and would be very much interested in learning about it. Bazinga!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sreekar had come up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence">Birefringence</a>, which also seemed interesting. None of us had heard about it before. With these two topics in mind, we asked our instructor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ee.iitm.ac.in/deepav/">Dr. Deepa Venkitesh</a> for her opinion and she asked us to go with the former.</p>

<p>Before I start explaining the technical details of the poster, do take a look at the poster we made (click on it for a PDF).

<p>In World War I, soldiers used long communication lines to maintain contact with their base. The people on the receiving side of the line, often could hear sounds that were very similar to that of <em>“falling grenades”</em>, when there were none falling. One keen observation was that this particular sound was heard during the times of lightning strikes.</p>

<p>Here’s a short sound clip of what they heard:</p>

<p>The first one, in which you would have noticed a tone of descending frequency, is called a <strong>Whistler</strong>, while the second, which consists of rising and falling tones of frequency is a <strong>Chorus</strong>. This post will talk more on whistlers as they are more extensively studied among the two.</p>

<p><strong>Whistlers</strong> are Very Low Frequency (VLF) emissions in the atmosphere that are characterised by a <em>tone of rapidly descending frequencies</em>.</p>

<p>Being long-wavelength (~ 100 km!!) <em>EM Waves</em>, it’s understandable that they couple into communication lines that are as long as 100 km. This explains the strange noises heard by soldiers in WWI.</p>

<h3 id="sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">Sources and generation of whistlers<a href="#sources-and-generation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>A natural question to ask is how these waves are generated in the first place. The literature on this is limited, but there is considerable evidence to say that the source of whistlers must be not very different from lightning.</p>

<p>The only known characteristic of whistlers that distinguishes it from ordinary lightning is their relatively high energy content. After accounting for attenuation losses, the estimated electromagnetic energy in a whistler producing stroke is about ten times as great as that in the average lightning flash. A sufficiently strong lightning flash should be able to produce whistler-mode signals.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing - we also detect these waves at locations where there may be no lightning at all. In fact, these waves can also be detected at places whose <em>magnetically conjugate point</em> has experienced a lightning strike. That means that there must be some <em>mode of propagation</em> that is making this possible. The theory behind it’s propagation can be intuitively understood using the basic concepts of a waveguide.</p>

<h3 id="waveguides">Waveguides<a href="#waveguides">#</a></h3>

<p>To the uninitiated, here’s the wikipedia definition of a waveguide:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A waveguide is a structure that guides waves, such as electromagnetic waves or sound, with minimal loss of energy by restricting expansion to one dimension or two. Without the physical constraint of a waveguide, wave amplitudes decrease according to the inverse square law as they expand into three dimensional space.</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- pic of waveguide -->

<p>It literally is in the name - It “guides” waves, sort of like a tunnel (over-simplified). One very popular waveguide is the ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_Fibre">optical fibre</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest idealised case of a waveguide is a <em>parallel plate waveguide</em>, in which the wave is constrained between <em>two conductors</em>. Solving Maxwell’s equations and applying boundary conditions will give us a solution which has a wave that propagates in a direction tangential to the plates.</p>

<p>Now, consider the earth and the ionosphere. The earth is a good conductor, in the sense that at the frequencies we are talking about (KHz), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss#Loss_tangent">loss tangent</a>, is about 600.</p>

<p>The ionosphere, as its name suggests, has a lot of ions, making it a good conductor as well. What we now have is a waveguide through which EM waves, more specifically VLF waves, can be guided through.</p>

<h3 id="propagation-of-whistlers">Propagation of Whistlers<a href="#propagation-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>Energy from a lightning source near the earth’s surface travels in the earth-ionosphere waveguide and enters the ionosphere continuously along the lower surface of the ionosphere. Wave components that enter the ionosphere at the location of a duct are then trapped and “conveyed” to the opposite hemisphere along the same magnetic line of force, which are aligned exactly along the duct, where they emerge from the ionosphere and re-enter the earth-ionosphere waveguide.</p>

<p>So…, a bunch of frequencies is generated by a lightning strike at a location, <em>at the same time</em>. All of them take the same path and reach another location. So, ideally we should be receiving all the frequencies at the same time. But we hear a tone of descending frequency. <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>The reason lies in the ionosphere. The velocity of propagation of a wave through the ionosphere is dependent on it’s frequency. This leads to a dispersion of waves, with each frequency traveling at a different speed.</p>

<p><img title="graph of $1/\sqrt{f} vs t" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Graph.png"></p>

<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>Due to the dispersion of waves in the ionosphere depending on their frequencies, different frequencies are received at different times, with the higher frequencies being received first, as seen from the above graph. This is why a whistler is a tone of descending frequency.</p>

<h3 id="detection-of-whistlers">Detection of Whistlers<a href="#detection-of-whistlers">#</a></h3>

<p>The theory’s great. But how do we practically detect and hear these sounds?</p>

<p>Since these are electromagnetic waves, we have to first “capture” these EM waves, then transduce them, i.e. convert them to audio to actually hear the audio clips you heard before.</p>

<p>The wavelength of these waves are extremely huge (100 km for a 3KHz wave). This means that it is not possible to have a <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/dipole.php">full-wavelength antenna</a>, for capturing the wave accurately. A typical VLF receiver is about 60ft long - there is very little signal current for reception. Using a cascaded combination of high gain, high input impedance (for better sensitivity) amplifiers and low pass filters, we can make up for the difference.</p>

<p>What’s a <em>spectrogram</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it is a graph, with x-axis as time (usually), y-axis as frequency and the intensity/amplitude at a point $(f, t)$ is given by it’s color.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201.jpg">
</p><p>Whistler spectrogram</p>
<p>Source: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler_(radio</a>)</i></p>

<p>This is a real-life spectrogram of a whistler. At around <strong>0355:29</strong>, you can a see a band of frequencies being generated. This is called a <em>tweek</em>.</p>

<p><img title="spectrogram example" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%201-mark-tweek.jpg">
</p><p>Tweek in a spectrogram</p>

<p>At near <strong>0355:31</strong>, you see that the “tone of descending frequencies” has started. Notice how there’s a time delay between the tweek and the start of the whistler. This tells us that it is detected elsewhere (remember the magnetically conjugate point?), meaning it has travelled (or the whistler has been detected at the same place as the tweek.)</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Helliwell">Robert A. Helliwell</a>, in his book <em>Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena</em>, the idealised spectrogram for a whistler is:
<img title="ideal-spectrogram" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202.png"></p>

<p>Ideal whistler spectrograms</p>
<p>Source: <i>Robert A. Helliwell</i>, Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena, Stanford University Press, 1965</p>

<p>There’s a lot more in the above diagram than just ideal spectrograms. The figure shows us a wealth of information.</p>

<p>If you look closely, we can see the ideal spectrogram containing all the “<em>reflections</em>” of the whistler.</p>

<p><strong>Hold On!</strong> Where did reflections come from?
Well, as I had mentioned that it propagates, I had mentioned that the tweek generated would travel into an ionospheric duct, then come back into the earth-ionosphere waveguide. Well, EM waves, in fact any wave, simply don’t do nothing when they travel from one medium to another.</p>

<p>Because of the change in refractive indices of the media, some of the energy carried by the waves will be reflected into the first medium, and the rest will be transmitted into the second (there’s also absorption of energy, but I’m ignoring that as it is very less compared to the other two).</p>

<p>In this part of the above figure,
<img title="box1" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box1.png">
we can see the tweek, and also a number of whistlers, each dragged out more than the previous. Such whistlers are detected at the same place of origin of the tweek. They are called as <em><strong>Odd-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, since they have “hopped” or “jumped” (i.e. reflected) an odd number of times.</p>

<p><em>Why are they getting dragged out more?</em> Because, each undergoes a greater amount of dispersion than the previous as they travel a lot more distance after each reflection before detecting them.</p>

<p>Similarly, in this part of the figure,
<img title="box2" src="https://aklsh.now.sh/blog/Whistler%20post/Figures/Fig%202-box2.png">
we can see all the <em><strong>Even-Hop Whistlers</strong></em>, and these are detected at the magnetically conjugate point to the point of origin of the tweek.</p>

<p>I had mentioned that the waves get dispersed in the ionosphere, right? Well, later studies showed that according to dispersion theory, every whistler should have a characteristic frequency (not necessarily the maximum frequency detected), that has the minimum time delay. This frequency is called <em>the nose …</em></p></article></div>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

But the portion&nbsp;of the population with less education now has fewer places to go as changes to the economy accelerate, Burt said.</p>  <p>"The oil and gas sector is not the growth driver for the economy as it was five years ago," the economist&nbsp;said. "The dynamics around that have changed considerably in recent years.

<p>Anti-epidemic authorities in north China's Tianjin Municipality are tracing close contacts with ice cream contaminated with the coronavirus after three samples tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>All of the products produced by Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company has been sealed and contained after the company sent the samples to the municipal centre for disease control on Tuesday and Wednesday, which later tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Preliminary epidemiological investigations show that the company produced the batch of ice cream using raw materials including milk powder imported from New Zealand and whey powder imported from Ukraine.</p>
<p>The company's 1,662 employees are currently placed under quarantine and have undergone nucleic acid testing on Thursday following the guidance of the Tianjin Center for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Authorities said the company produced 4,836 boxes of contaminated ice cream, among which 2,089 boxes in storage have been sealed away.</p>
<p>A total of 935 boxes of the ice cream, out of 2,747 boxes that entered the market, were in Tianjin and only 65 boxes were sold to markets.</p>
<p>Authorities advised residents who may have bought the product to report their health and physical movements to their communities.</p>
<p>The city has also notified the market regulation authorities in other provinces where the ice cream was sent so it can be traced.</p>

  <p>Have you ever reviewed a code that you've written weeks, months or years ago; and then you realize you do not understand what it's doing? that it's too complex? Then imagine what will be the experience of developers other than you when they will review it!</p> 
  <p>This is a sign of code having poor readability!</p> 
  <h2>Why code readability is important?</h2> 
  <p>There are 2 audiences for any code:</p> 
  <ol>
   <li>The computer that is going to execute that code, once translated to <code>01010</code> by compilers.</li>
   <li>The developers who are going to maintain that code in the programming language it has been written.</li>
  </ol> 
  <p>The purpose of code readability is to help developers to easily read, understand and maintain that code.</p> 
  <p>This is what happens when working with code having poor readability:</p> 
  <ul>
   <li>You might misunderstand the code and use it in ways it was not meant to be used.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>You will then spend multiple iterations getting the change right.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Or you might change the code, unintentionally breaking functionality elsewhere.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>Overall, you waste more time with such code and it lead a a lot frustrations.&nbsp;Readable code is easy understand and change. This mean we can add new features or fix bugs much faster.</p> 
  <h2>How to make readable code</h2> 
  <p>Look at the following example of code, it extracts all the transactions associated with the event&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;from a CSV file and store them into another CSV file.</p> 
  <pre>class DataExtractor {
  public int extract(File in, File out) {
     List&lt;String&gt; lines;
     try {
        lines = Files.readAllLines(in.toPath());
     } catch (IOException e){
        return 0
     }

     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (columns.size == 4 &amp;&amp; "1".equals(columns[1]){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }

     try {
       Files.write(out.toPath(), extracted);
     } catch(IOException e){
       e.printStackTrace(System.err);
     }
     return filtered.size();
  }
}</pre> 
  <p>We are going to apply 5 rules to improve the readability of this code.</p> 
  <h2>1. Don't use magic numbers</h2> 
  <p>Magic number are values that are used directly in the code. Instead, you should declare then as constants that you'll use in the code.</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1"

  public int extract(File in, File out) {
     ...
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }
     ...
  }
}</pre> 
  <h2>2. Simplify your conditional statements</h2> 
  <p><code>if</code> statements having more that 1 conditions should be reduced. Move all the conditions to a private function having a name explaining the conditions evaluated.</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) {
     ...
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (isReadTransaction(column)){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }
     ...
  }

  private boolean isReadTransaction(String[] columns) {
     return columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]
  }
}</pre> 
  <h2>3. Don't handle exceptions</h2> 
  <p>Unless you know what to do with the exception, do not handle them, and let the caller of your function deal with it.</p> 
  <p>In our exemple,&nbsp;<code>extract()</code> is extracting the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;transactions but is also handling <code>IOException</code>. To simplify this function, we are going remove the responsibility of handling exceptions by changing its signature to:</p> 
  <p><code>public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException</code></p> 
  <p>By adding to the declaration <code>throws&nbsp;IOException</code>, we are transferring the responsibility of exception handling to the caller. Now the code is much simpler:</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException {
     List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(in.toPath());

     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (isReadTransaction(column)){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }

     Files.write(out.toPath(), extracted);
     return filtered.size();
  }

  private boolean isReadTransaction(String[] columns) {
     return columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]
  }
}</pre> 
  <h2>4. Write short functions</h2> 
  <p>A short function is a function that is reduced the minimal number of instructions.</p> 
  <p>If you look at the <code>extract()</code>, at high level it has 3 blocks of code: read a file, extract read transactions and write to a file. To improve readability if <code>extract()</code>, we will move those 3 blocs of code into private functions</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException {
     List&lt;String&gt; lines = read(in);
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = extract(lines);
     write(extracted, out)
     return filtered.size();
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; read(File in) throws IOException {
     return files.readAllLines(in.toPath());
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; extract(List&lt;String&gt; lines) {
     List&lt;String&gt; extracted = new ArrayList();
     for (int i=0 ; i&lt;lines.length ; i++){
         String line = lines[i];
         String[] columns = line.split(",");
         if (isReadTransaction(column)){
            extracted.add(line)
         }
     }
  }

  private void write(List&lt;String&gt; extracted, File out) throws IOException {
    Files.write(out.toPath(), extracted);
  }

  private boolean isReadTransaction(String[] columns) {
     return columns.size == COLUMN_COUNT &amp;&amp; EVENT_READ.equals(columns[1]
  }
}</pre> 
  <p>Note that as we are moving code to functions, we make sure that each of the function do not handle exceptions!</p> 
  <h2>5. Use meaningful names</h2> 
  <p>Name you use for functions of variable are critical to improve the readability of the code. It helps you to understand what the code is doing, without going in the the details of each function.</p> 
  <p>Look at the changes we did in the code:</p> 
  <pre>public class DataExtractor {
  private static final int COLUMN_COUNT = 4;
  private static final String EVENT_READ = "1";

  public int extract(File in, File out) throws IOException {
     List&lt;String&gt; transactions = readTransactions(in);
     List&lt;String&gt; readTransactions = extractReadTransactions(transactions);
     writeTransactions(extracted, out)
     return readTransactions.size();
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; readTransactions(File in) throws IOException {
   ...
  }

  private List&lt;String&gt; extractReadTransactions(List&lt;String&gt; lines) {
   ...
  }

  private void writeTransactions(List&lt;String&gt; transactions, File out) throws IOException {
    ...
  }
  ...
}</pre> 
  <hr> 
  <p>Coding is a social activity. When writing your code, other than ensuring that it works, you must always make sure that other developers will be able to read and understand it. Improving code readability leads to simpler code, simpler code is easier to maintain.</p> 
  <p>Readability is one of the most important measure of code quality</p>

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong>Q: What’s the best way to get to a proficient level in a target language quickly?</strong></h2>



<p>A: Create a solid foundation through <strong>study</strong>, <strong>immerse</strong> yourself in native media, <strong>and</strong> <strong>practice</strong> <strong>generating</strong> your own speech and writing based on what you know.  Repeat the process and have joy while doing it.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="700" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/study-immersion-generation-triangle.png" alt=""><figcaption>Study, Immersion, Generation — three corners of a triangle for expedient attainment of proficiency in any target language.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At Japanese Complete we focus on creating solutions to target “Study” and “Generation,” while others in the world have been quite successful at creating solutions that target “Immersion.”</p>







<p>For example, our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/">innovative online textbook</a> has thorough grammar explanations not available elsewhere, and lessons to learn kanji by meaning-word and mnemonic, with a portion of the page dedicated to practicing your kanji drawing skill.  We also have quizzes for each chapter so you can be sure you are recalling the verbs, kanji, and grammatical particles you have learned in each lesson.</p>



<p><a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=1265">Because Japanese grammar is so different from English</a> and Romance languages, it is vital that one has a very solid foundation upon which to build their understanding.  If one were simply “dropped into Japan” one day out of the blue, it would be an uphill climb in learning the basic grammar through immersion, which is why stepping stones in the very beginning are excellent for speeding up one’s attainment of proficiency.</p>



<h3>Frequency Analysis</h3>



<p>There have been some extensive Frequency Analysis projects of the Japanese language, such as the BCCWJ (Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese) that aim to provide educators with a way to teach the language in a sequence consistent with immediate usefulness, effectiveness, and proportional to occurence in the wild.  For example, the <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/777">most frequent 777 kanji cover roughly 90% of all kanji seen in the wild</a>, while the next 700 (#778-1447) cover just 8%.  This is consistent with Zipf’s law, and Zipf’s insight can readily be brought to language learning by using a frequency-based dictionary or otherwise created frequency-list.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="300" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/the-graph.png" alt=""><figcaption>Set yourself up for success with a solid foundation based on Frequency Analysis and Research-Based methods.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>“Get your ears wet.” </p>



<p>Free services such as <a href="https://supernative.tv/">Super Native TV</a> allow learners to listen to small clips of real Japanese shows and videos, and even do small quizzes based on listening and filling in the blank — a portion of the original is deleted and one has to type in the correct missing words or letters.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-18-at-5.08.17-PM.png" alt="" width="780" height="597"><figcaption>SuperNative.TV has a great interface for listening to real Japanese media and practicing your listening and recall.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Browser Extensions</h2>



<p>Other useful pieces for immersion without dunking yourself into the nation of Japan straight-away include browser extensions such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/">RikaiChamp for Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en">RikaiKun for Chrome</a> that function as dynamic tooltip dictionaries for browsing the web.  Now you can go to a Japanese news site and hover over text to get the definitions from the loaded dictionary files straight into a useful tooltip.</p>



<figure><img src="https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/228/228746.png?modified=1599530672" alt=""><figcaption>Provided Screenshots of RikaiChamp for Firefox.  Rikai means “understanding” or “comprehension.”</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also new projects trying to create a stronger immersion-based environment for daily life on the screen — <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Migaku">Migaku</a> (jp: “to polish”) is a (mostly?) open-source project that, when subscribed to their $5 tier on their Patreon, provides a browser extension that uses loaded dictionary files to define text with tooltips, and also allows one to create flash cards seamlessly within that experience.  There is also the ability to create flash cards from subtitles on Netflix and anything with .srt files so you can create flash cards for snippets from your favorite video and television programs. Although it might be rough around the edges, there are now 3 lads working on it full-time so hopefully it will just get better and better for language immersion in the browser.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1303" height="699" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-18-at-5.28.18-PM.png" alt=""><figcaption>Migaku Browser Extension for creating flash cards while browsing, and for creating flash cards from videos you watch with subtitle files.</figcaption></figure>







<h2>Writing</h2>



<p>The last step of the loop for fluency is <strong>generation</strong>, which occurs when one uses their target language to speak or write.  At Japanese Complete we have created some very interesting tools to aide users in generating grammatical Japanese, such as our tool <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/?p=1099">Wag: the Visual Sentence Composer</a> that lets you build grammatically-correct sentences in Japanese via point-and-click.   </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="845" height="639" src="https://japanesecomplete.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wag-maker-a1.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Visual sentence-composer for Japanese “Wag,” also provides rudimentary translations via tech indistinguishable from magic.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Speaking</h2>



<p>For generating speaking ability, <a href="https://supernative.tv/">supernative.tv</a> has a listen-and-repeat mode.  There are also several services for connecting with language experts and practicing your conversation skills available as apps for mobile devices.  There is also the opportunity to connect with language tutors via video chat and practice one’s speaking abilities this way.</p>



<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>



<p>Create a <strong>solid foundation</strong> through exemplary materials so you waste no time.  This is studying well.</p>



<p><strong>Immerse yourself</strong> in native media as much as possible: news, shows, film, youtube, articles, books, songs, and in the case of Japanese: manga, anime, etc.</p>



<p>Practice <strong>generating language</strong> both verbal and written so you can quickly attain a flexible level of proficiency in your target language.</p>



<p>By finding excellent tools to satisfy each of the three circles of “Study, Immersion, and Generation,” (and using them on repeat) one can swiftly attain fluency in any language.</p>

<p>If you look around the web for reasons why you should learn Racket, or its ancestors Lisp and Scheme, you'll find no shortage of answers. On Racket's official website, it is proudly named the <a href="https://racket-lang.org/"><em>language-oriented programming language</em></a>. For Matthew Butterick, author of <em><a href="https://beautifulracket.com/">Beautiful Racket</a></em>, it's Racket's <a href="https://beautifulracket.com/appendix/why-racket-why-lisp.html"><em>beauty</em> and <em>expressiveness</em></a> that draw him to it. And for others, like programmers Eric Raymond and Paul Graham, it is worth learning for its <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"><em>profound enlightenment</em>,</a> or because it can be used as a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"><em>secret weapon</em>.</a></p>
<p>These are all compelling answers that reflect the truly wide variety of programmers that the Lisp family of languages attract. But none of these are why James Stelly has written his new book, <a href="https://nostarch.com/racket-programming-fun-way"><em>Racket Programming the Fun Way</em></a>. Instead, as its name suggests, Stelly thinks you should learn Racket because it is just plain <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>There's good reason for Stelly's appraisal, as Racket's simple and consistent syntax makes it an ideal language for new programmers, as well as those who are tired of the all-too-similar C-like languages. Out of the box, Racket also includes <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/">DrRacket</a>, a graphical IDE, and boasts a large standard library for creating <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/">GUIs</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html">drawings</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/games/index.html">games</a>, <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/">math plots</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>At first glance, the book certainly seems to align with this sentiment. Stelly's writing is light and inviting, and the book's playful cover matches the little illustrations and diagrams scattered throughout the text. </p>
<p>After the introductory chapters, which cover the basics of s-expressions, linked lists, lambda functions, and core standard library functions, Stelly begins to build on the foundation he has laid. The next three chapters deal with Racket's graphical capabilities, covering math plots, GUIs, and data visualizations. In all of these, Stelly finds ways to keep the mathematically-inclined reader engaged by introducing some basic concepts in set theory, trigonometry, and statistics. For me, though, the most interesting parts of these chapters come in their respective "applications" sections, where Stelly tiles Fibonacci numbers and implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">the game of Nim</a>, among other diversions.</p>
<p>The book's strongest chapters, however, and the ones that would persuade me to recommend the book to experienced yet curious programmers, come at the end. In these, Stelly addresses graph theory, logic programming, pushdown automata and Turing machines, and finally, lexing and parsing. Importantly, many of these concepts are addressed in a purpose-driven way that is designed to solve problems: implementing depth first search helps Stelly solve Sudoku, while the parsing chapter is centered around building a functional algebraic calculator.</p>
<p>While the more advanced computer science topics addressed in these chapters can seem intimidating, Stelly covers them in a way that does them justice while still being approachable to those without a formal CS education. Even though these topics may not be covered with the same rigor as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms">CLRS</a> or <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>, I think the clear diagrams and readable Racket code presented in these sections serve as a great way for those who want to learn more to gain valuable intuition before studying the concepts more in depth.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that I wish Stelly had included more exercises at the end of these chapters, since they are deep topics that warrant more exploring by the reader. It is also disappointing that Stelly did not find any space to include a treatment of Racket <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/macros.html">macros</a>, since they are one of the most unique and powerful features of the language.</p>
<p>Still, <em>Racket Programming the Fun Way</em> is a decidedly fun and informative read that I would recommend both to novice Racket programmers and those who are looking to take a bit of a deeper dive into the language. Stelly's book joins good company alongside <em>Beautiful Racket</em> and <a href="https://htdp.org/"><em>How To Design Programs</em></a> as excellent books on Racket, which can hopefully bring the language to a wider audience in the programming community.</p>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <div><p>During university in 2005, I was introduced to the mac as a viable option for someone interested in programming as a
career. Somone pitched it to me as a beautiful and well thought-out OS, with UNIX under the hood.</p>

<p>At the time, I was using Linux for school work, and Windows for games. I persuaded my parents that I could get
university work done on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook">iBook G4</a> and over time became enamoured by the idea of
being a Mac indie developer.</p>

<p>2006 saw the start of the <a href="https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/11/06/">Delicious Generation</a> - a resurgence of new
developers pushing the design aesthetics of the Mac, and exploring different ways of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist">engaging the Mac users community</a>. Whilst I wasn’t quite focused enough to be
able to contribute apps, that time period left a mark on me. In 2007, I got a
<a href="https://twitter.com/orta/status/36295382?s=20">student scholarship for WWDC</a> and managed to at least get a sense that
being a Mac indie was something I could potentially have my career as. It took until 2011 before I started working on
indie Mac apps, and that didn’t last too long due to VISA issues.</p>

<p>I didn’t really put my energy into being a Mac indie developer either full-time nor in my spare time. Once I became
confident enough in my programming skills to do serious work on the Mac, the open source community tools community was
really where my heart lay. I discovered I was a tool builder, not strictly a product one.</p>

<p>I never got a job with a focus on the Mac again.</p>

<p>It’s somewhat nebulous, but during the announcements of Apple’s new macOS 11 this year, I felt like a line had been
crossed in my mind: The Mac isn’t really the right OS for me anymore.</p>

<p>I’m not bitter, things have just changed since I first made the decision to move to the Mac. My priorities have changed,
and so have Apple’s. That’s OK.</p>

<h3 id="the-mac-is-for-ios-users">The Mac is for iOS Users</h3>

<p>I think it’s great that people who use iOS can re-use their apps now and access them as first-class citizens. I think
it’s great for them that the user interface of the Mac has been re-designed to be more in line with iOS. People with
iPhones are the majority here, and the Mac is a getting closer to being a rounding error in Apple’s financial reports
(today the Mac is 8% of all Apple profit, and a generally shrinking %.)</p>

<p><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reports-3q-2020-results-11-25b-profit-on-59-7b-revenue-4-for-1-stock-split-announced.2248022/"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/N7MLkfnlwvkle7Xs2CSzK7f2Myc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/01/1q20_earnings_line_labels.jpg" alt="https://images.macrumors.com/t/N7MLkfnlwvkle7Xs2CSzK7f2Myc=/1600x0/filters:quality(90)/article-new/2020/01/1q20_earnings_line_labels.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The Mac reaps benefits of all sorts from the halo effect of iOS’s stunning growth (more engineers, more eyes on the
platform, shared tooling). It’s also the only platform for making iOS apps, and Apple cares about it.</p>

<p>The bit that’s tricky for me is that I don’t use a phone, and I want my computer to be more like a truck than a car.</p>

<p>I don’t find a phone to be a useful device for me. When I’m not at a computer I don’t want to be instantly available to
others, nor do I use a phone as a media consuming device. It’s hard enough to find a life balance with my code
contributions without another place to get pings from.</p>

<p>That means that roughly the last 5 years of Mac changes have passed me by. Desktop OSes are mature, and so Apple has
prioritised a lot of porting iOS features, APIs and building syncing systems between them. Again, lots of cool stuff for
most folks, but not pushing the Mac, it’s pushing the consumer device ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="progressively-more-restricted-computing">Progressively more restricted computing</h3>

<p>It’s unlikely Apple will ever truly force an App Store only system on the Mac. However, that doesn’t mean that the
incentives aren’t there for apple both financially (because Apple gets a 15-30% cut of all transactions) or from a
security perspective (Mac apps have a stricter sandbox and can be trusted more by users.)</p>

<p>Inside Apple, I bet keeping the Mac a good general purpose computer is a constant uphill battle.
<a href="https://sigpipe.macromates.com/2020/macos-catalina-slow-by-design/">The</a>
<a href="https://medium.com/rocknnull/xcode-8-plugins-alcatraz-the-end-of-an-era-ea6e63617d14">screws</a>
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">keep</a> on
<a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html">tightening</a> .</p>

<p>I must stress, for nearly every Mac user these are good things. They don’t want a fully general purpose computer. For
most folks a web browser, a useful file-system and their own edge-case purpose apps provide all they need.</p>

<p>The move towards a more app-store focused, sandboxed OS means that whole genres of apps aren’t possible anymore. I’m
particularly sad about what happened to Safari extensions over the
<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/01/safari-14-added-webextensions-support-so-where-are-the-extensions/">last few years</a>.
I don’t want to put my time into a platform where the people starting today work in an increasingly smaller domain.</p>

<h3 id="native-is-less-valuable">Native is less valuable</h3>

<p>The last decade of focus on mobile by everyone has drastically reduced the value of writing a native app for a single
platform. The Mac has kinda been hit the hardest by this in my opinion. Mac software used to be about HIG conformance,
consistent design and interaction models - all of which tended to come at a pretty expensive price.</p>

<p>The Mac software ecosystem was like a street of local shops run by people in the community, and then post-iPhone all the
big shops moved in because they just wanted to make sure they were represented in the area. Modern desktop environments
now feel quite same-y, but this also trivialized OS switching costs.</p>

<p>The rise of Electron being the most <em>accessible</em> developer environment for desktop OSes has meant that all sorts of apps
are available on all platforms. They’re performant enough, and far more importantly <em>they actually exist</em>. You have to
have a lot of resources to ship a Website, Windows App, Mac App, iOS App and Android app just to somewhat be where your
users are.</p>

<p>Unless your company builds an app for just one platform, it’s just not worth the engineering investment to make
something work amazingly for each platform. In part that’s the initial cost, but the maintenance is also a long term
pain because OSes do re-designs or change the underlying tech. At Artsy we used to think it’d be roughly 1 month per
year in just keeping up with iOS updates, imagine that but also per platform and you’re struggling to even stand still.</p>

<p>Using something like Electron, and to some extent React Native, and you get to skip a lot of the OS update rat-race and
just work on a stable platform that runs across many OSes. Any engineer can create a feature that works across all
platforms. On top of that you get to use the world’s most popular programming language (JS) and UI toolset (HTML/CSS) to
make your apps.</p>

<p>These incentives means a lot of the apps I use today are all cross-platform Electron apps: VS Code,
Slack/Discord/Matrix, Spotify, Keybase/Signal</p>

<p>As the Mac software market gets harder to make money in, a few of the native apps I used have also moved to be
subscription services. This is in large part due to the app store de-valuing software (can’t pay for software updates,
you realistically have to keep providing updates for OS changes, trial system barely exists, people have lower
price-point expectations due to iOS’ scale) but sometimes due to these apps wanting to build and provide syncing systems
to account for mobile devices.</p>

<p>I’m all for paying money for applications, I especially like “pay for x months of updates” but generally subscriptions
are a trap to me. Which has meant independently of switching platforms, I’ve moved off more native software over the
last few years.</p>

<p>I do think there’s still a space for optimized native single platform software on the desktop (Sketch, Paw, Pixen, Nova
and Screenflow being great examples) but they are progressively becoming more and more niche.</p>

<p>Apple knows this, and the Mac has slowly become a better platform for time-cheap iOS ports in the last 2 releases.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The point is not that the Mac is terrible, or that the ecosystem is dying etc. I don’t think that. It’s that the bits of
the Mac that kept me tied to it (building native apps for a living, a cohesive well designed UI, specific applications
which I use daily) don’t have the same pull as they once did. These used to be great trade-offs against the
closed-source nature of the OS/apps, and Apple’s occasional devrel hiccups.</p>

<p>So 2020 became the start of looking for alternatives. The result being <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> which
seems to be ticking all of the things I want. It’s well designed by a small team, they seem to be focused on providing a
cohesive OS by building all of the main apps for the OS and has the added bonus of being easy to contribute to. I’d love
to be able to put some time into fixing some of my papercuts with the OS.</p>

<p><img src="https://elementary.io/images/screenshots/desktop.jpg"></p>

<h3 id="its-elementary">It’s elementary</h3>

<p>In a way, elementary OS is like using an older build of macOS
(<a href="https://blog.elementary.io/introducing-elementary-os-5-1-hera/">elementary OS 5</a> feels a lot like macOS Snow Leopard,
with <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/updates-for-july-2020/">6’s feature-set</a> echoing macOS Lion). This might sound like a
insult to elementary, but honestly I can’t remember what’s new in the Mac anymore because I don’t really use the new
features.</p>

<p>There’s quite a lot of modern features you may be used to that aren’t on elementary OS, but the features that make you
productive as an engineer are. There’s a great terminal, web browser, file manager and your key IDE apps are likely
cross-platform by this point. Keyboard shortcuts work solidly. Almost all of my hardware worked out of the box.</p>

<p>I’ve not done a hard switch, probably never will, my laptop still runs macOS and I have a Mac Pro still around - there’s
no need to junk them, but I’m competent in using Linux as my daily driver.</p>

<p>I think moving to an OS which I can contribute to, and especially elementary OS which is <em>mainly</em> contributed to by a
few individuals using the same toolchain, is something I can do now. I’m really interested in diving more into the OS,
all of the apps seem to be built in a straightforward way and I’ve found a way to write native GTK applications with
TypeScript to scratch my own itches. Hopefully the write-up next year will include a discussion on how that’s gone.</p>

<h3 id="migration-pattern">Migration Pattern</h3>

<p>Roughly my route to switching first was about making long-term changes to my Mac usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Move to electron apps, or cross platform alternatives. For example I switched from 1Password to Enpass, Sketch to
Figma, Apple Music to Spotify, Apple TV to Netflix, Safari to Firefox etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to a non-Apple keyboard/mouse. The non-native feel of Apple products on other OSes will give you constant
uncanny valley. I use a Logitech “MX Keys” keyboard, and “MX Vertical” mouse and they’re great. If you’re bold you
could try …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Kenny Chow was</strong> <strong>born</strong> in Myanmar, and moved to New York City in 1987. He worked for years as a diamond setter for a jeweller, earning enough to buy a house for his family before he was laid off in 2011. At that point, Chow decided to become a taxi driver like his brother, scraping together financing to buy a taxi medallion for $750,000. This allowed him to operate as a sole proprietor, with the medallion as an asset.</p>
<p>For a while, everything went according to plan, with taxi medallions rising in value to more than <span>$1 million.</span> Then the bubble burst, and along came ridesharing apps such as Lyft and Uber. The value of Chowâ€™s medallion plummeted, and it became harder to keep up the payments on his loan. In 2018, he took his own life.</p>
<p>Weâ€™d all recognise that Chowâ€™s situation is unfortunate. But, arguably, he took a calculated gamble when he purchased a risky asset, and so some of us might be tempted to blame him for his own misfortune. According to one school of thought, when these sorts of bets donâ€™t pan out, only the gambler is to blame. That might sound callous, but itâ€™s indeed the attitude that many of us seem to hold, at least in the United States: a 2014 Pew Research report <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/26/section-3-fairness-of-the-economic-system-views-of-the-poor-and-the-social-safety-net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">found</a> that <span>39 per cent</span> of Americans believed that poverty was due to a lack of effort on poor peopleâ€™s part. When â€˜effortâ€™ includes an inability to properly weigh up the risks inherent in a decision, this suggests that, in the end, many of us think that people are responsible for their own bad luck.</p>
<p>I disagree with this view. But my reasons arenâ€™t solely political or moral in nature. Rather, insights from complexity science â€“ specifically, computational complexity theory â€“ show mathematically that there are hard limits on our capacity to make accurate and precise calculations of risk. Since itâ€™s often impossible to get a reasonable sense of what will happen in the future, itâ€™s unfair to blame people with good intentions who end up worse off as a result of unforeseen circumstances. This leads to the conclusion that compassion, not blame, is the appropriate attitude towards those who act in good faith but whose bets in life donâ€™t pay off.</p>
<p>The starting point is to note that, for people to be held responsible for their actions, they have to know about certain features of the world. In many cases, even this minimal condition for blameworthiness isnâ€™t satisfied. For example, Chow would have struggled to predict that the rise of ridesharing apps would crater the market for taxi medallions in New York City â€“ but so, too, did most of us. By their very nature, technological disruptions are difficult to foresee; if they were easy to predict, early investors in these technologies wouldnâ€™t get so rich. Such a low bar for blameworthiness seems too harsh to be plausible; how can any of us be blamed for failing to spot trends that almost no one was able to see, despite the significant material incentives for doing so?</p>
<p>The bar for blameworthiness can be made more precise by saying that, in order to be blamed for a gamble, people must possess an accurate causal model of the system in which they act. That is, they must know how different variables in the system do or donâ€™t affect one another. Chowâ€™s bet on a taxi medallion went poorly because of a complex causal nexus of speculation and technological development that led the price for taxi medallions to rise steadily before falling precipitously. To predict the collapse in the price of taxi medallions without the benefit of luck, one would need to have a crisp picture of this labyrinthine causal structure.</p>
<p>Under conditions of extreme complexity, itâ€™s rarely the case that people meet the bar for blameworthiness</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s where computational complexity theory kicks in. It turns out that learning the causal structure of real-world systems is very hard. More precisely, trying to infer the most likely causal structure of a system â€“ no matter how much data we have about it â€“ is what theorists call an NP-hard problem: given a general dataset, it can be fiendishly hard for an algorithm to learn the causal structure that produced it. In many cases, as more variables are added to the dataset, the minimum time that it takes any algorithm to learn the structure of the system under study grows exponentially. Under the <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-probably-is-a-computer-whatever-that-means" rel="noopener">assumption</a> that our brains also learn by running algorithms, these results apply to human reasoning just as much as they apply to any computer.</p>
<p>One way to get around these constraints is to assume that the real world has a relatively simple causal structure: for example, we could assume that no variable in a system (say, the price of oil) depends on more than two other variables (say, demand and supply of oil). If we restrict the possibilities in this way, then estimating a causal structure becomes less difficult. Such heuristic approaches are a crucial part of how humans actually form beliefs, as the philosopher Julia Staffel has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nous.12254" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">argued</a>. However, treating a complex system as though itâ€™s simple is a dangerous game; heuristics can misrepresent the world in consequential ways. Indeed, the unpredictability of the course of our lives is partly due to rich causal complexity of the social world, with its interlocking web of economic, political, psychological and other factors. Under these conditions of extreme complexity, which are typical of most real-world systems, itâ€™s rarely the case that people can ever meet the bar for blameworthiness described above.</p>
<p><strong>A better way</strong> <strong>for</strong> a person to deal with the overwhelming complexity of the social world is to hedge their bets. By investing so much of his worth in a taxi medallion, Chow put all his eggs in one basket. So, you might say, he made himself particularly susceptible to ruin. What individuals should do instead, perhaps, is pursue a diverse range of offsetting strategies that eliminate or drastically reduce the risk of catastrophe, even under conditions of severe uncertainty.</p>
<p>The problem is that much of economic and social life in affluent countries is structured to require individuals to commit most of their resources towards one strategy for pursuing a flourishing life. Taking out a student loan or mortgage, or buying a taxi medallion, are all strategies that require a large, if not total, commitment of a personâ€™s financial resources. Here, real hedging would require us to start from a place of considerable wealth, and so it isnâ€™t a viable strategy for many. Most of us remain consigned to placing big bets in a casino where itâ€™s effectively impossible to know the underlying odds. The precarity of this situation means that compassion, not blame, is the appropriate attitude to have towards those who end up on the losing end of these bets.</p>
<p>Questions about the attitudes that we ought to have towards others are psychological and moral in nature. But theyâ€™re also politically significant. How we regard those who end up less fortunate informs how we address social inequality, and the extent to which we care about it. This brings us back to Kenny Chowâ€™s death, and indeed, the deaths of so many others. Since the year 2000, life expectancy in the US has fallen, as the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">shown</a> â€“ and this decrease has been driven almost entirely by an increase in what they call â€˜deaths of despairâ€™, such as drug overdoses and suicides. Despair thrives where empathy is missing; right now, our lack of compassion for one another is killing us.</p>
<p>Reversing this trend requires a policy response, but it also requires a shift in our attitudes towards those who end up worse off as a result of risky but well-intentioned decisions. The limits of our ability to infer the complex causal structure of the social world lead directly to the conclusion that blame isnâ€™t appropriate. No matter how smart we think we are, thereâ€™s a hard limit on what we can know, and we could easily end up on the losing end of a big bet. We owe it to ourselves, and others, to build a more compassionate world.</p>

<p>Prompted by tweets from <a href="http://twitter.com/hacks4pancakes">Lesley</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dave_universetf">Dave</a>, I thought about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switches</a> again and came up with a rather cheap solution to my individual situation (YMMY, as usual).</p>
<p>As I've <a href="https://www.die-welt.net/2020/06/show-your-desk/">written last year</a>, my desk has one monitor, keyboard and mouse and two computers. Since writing that post I got a new (bigger) monitor, but also an USB switch again (a <a href="https://www.digitus.info/en/products/computer-and-office-accessories/computer-accessories/usb-components-and-accessories/switches/da-73300-1/">DIGITUS USB 3.0 Sharing Switch</a>) - this time one that doesn't freak out my dock \o/</p>
<p>However, having to switch the used computer in two places (USB and monitor) is rather inconvenient, but also getting an KVM switch that can do 4K@60Hz was out of question.</p>
<p>Luckily, hackers gonna hack, everything, and not only receipt printers (😉). There is a tool called <a href="https://www.ddcutil.com/"><code>ddcutil</code></a> that can talk to your monitor and change various settings. And <code>udev</code> can execute commands when (USB) devices connect… You see where this is going?</p>
<p>After installing the package (available both in Debian and Fedora), we can inspect our system with <code>ddcutil detect</code>. You might have to load the <code>i2c_dev</code> module (thanks Philip!) before this works -- it seems to be loaded automatically on my Fedora, but you never know 😅.</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil detect
<span>Invalid display</span>
<span>   I2C bus:             /dev/i2c-4</span>

<span>   This is an eDP laptop display. Laptop displays do not support DDC/CI.</span>

</pre>
<p>The first detected display is the built-in one in my laptop, and those don't support DDC anyways. The second one is a ghost (see <a href="https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/160">ddcutil#160</a>) which we can ignore. But the third one is the one we can (and will control). As this is the only <em>valid</em> display <code>ddcutil</code> found, we don't need to specify which display to talk to in the following commands. Otherwise we'd have to add something like <code>--display 1</code> to them.</p>
<p>A <code>ddcutil capabilities</code> will show us what the monitor is capable of (or what it thinks, I've heard some give rather buggy output here) -- we're mostly interested in the "Input Source" feature (Virtual Control Panel (VCP) code <code>0x60</code>):</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil capabilities
<span>…</span>
<span>   Feature: 60 (Input Source)</span>
<span>      Values:</span>
<span>         0f: DisplayPort-1</span>
<span>         11: HDMI-1</span>
<span>         12: HDMI-2</span>
<span>…</span>
</pre>
<p>Seems mine supports it, and I should be able to switch the inputs by jumping between <code>0x0f</code>, <code>0x11</code> and <code>0x12</code>. You can see other values defined by the spec in <code>ddcutil vcpinfo 60 --verbose</code>, some monitors are using wrong values for their inputs 🙄. Let's see if <code>ddcutil getvcp</code> agrees that I'm using DisplayPort now:</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil getvcp 0x60
<span>VCP code 0x60 (Input Source                  ): DisplayPort-1 (sl=0x0f)</span>
</pre>
<p>And try switching to HDMI-1 using <code>ddcutil setvcp</code>:</p>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x11
</pre>
<p>Cool, cool. So now we just need a way to trigger input source switching based on some event…</p>
<p>There are three devices connected to my USB switch: my keyboard, my mouse and my Yubikey. I do use the mouse and the Yubikey while the laptop is not docked too, so these are not good indicators that the switch has been turned to the laptop. But the keyboard is!</p>
<p>Let's see what vendor and product IDs it has, so we can write an <code>udev</code> rule for it:</p>
<pre><span>$</span> lsusb
<span>…</span>
<span>Bus 005 Device 006: ID 17ef:6047 Lenovo ThinkPad Compact Keyboard with TrackPoint</span>
<span>…</span>
</pre>
<p>Okay, so let's call <code>ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x0f</code> when the USB device <code>0x17ef:0x6047</code> is added to the system:</p>
<pre>ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="17ef", ATTR{idProduct}=="6047", RUN+="/usr/bin/ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x0f"
</pre>
<pre><span>$</span> sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ddcutil.rules
<span>$</span> sudo udevadm control --reload
</pre>
<p>And done! Whenever I connect my keyboard now, it will force my screen to use DisplayPort-1.</p>
<p>On my workstation, I deployed the same rule, but with <code>ddcutil setvcp 0x60 0x11</code> to switch to HDMI-1 and my cheap not-really-KVM-but-in-the-end-KVM-USB-switch is done, for the price of one USB switch (~30€).</p>
<p>Note: if you want to use <code>ddcutil</code> with a Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Dock (or any other dock using Displayport Multi-Stream Transport (MST)), you'll need <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/adb48b26985686f93f20ca71c16c067d790e7af3">kernel 5.10</a> or newer, which fixes a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/37">bug</a> that prevents <a href="https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/issues/11"><code>ddcutil</code> from talking to the monitor using I²C</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jan-2021">Jan 2021</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever written an interpreted programming language you’ve probably thought about writing a compiler for it. Compilers are hard. As I’ve worked on programming languages I’ve always thought of writing a compiler as some sort of final boss always looming in the background.</p>
<p>If writing a compiler is a final boss, implementing closures are one of its most powerful attacks. Closures are complicated. Suddenly functions transform from mere labels you can jump to into heap allocated objects with associated data and pointers of their own.</p>
<p>Seemingly as a result of this I’ve noticed that many intro texts and blog posts about writing a compiler tend to avoid closures. Even Ghuloum’s venerable paper <em>An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</em> doesn’t seem to give them as much time as they deserve.</p>
<p>Here, I hope to help right this by walking through how I added closures to my compiled lisp in as much detail as is reasonable. The process of implementing closures is pretty nicely split into two tasks. The first task is to determine what variables each function in your program closes over. The second task is then to emit code to close over those values and construct closure objects. We'll call these two steps static analysis and compilation.</p>
<h2 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.github.com/ZekeMedley/lustc">lisp</a> that this is based on there are two ways that variables can be created: as function arguments, or inside of a let expression. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>;; As function arguments</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>(fn (variable) variable)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a><span>;; Inside a let expression</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>(<span>let</span> variable <span>10</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
  <p>The goal of our static analysis pass is for each function to determine what variables that are used inside of it that it does not define. We say that those variables are free variables and that the function <em>closes over</em> them. For example, in the function below the variable <code>free</code> is a free variable in the function bound to <code>add-free</code>.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>(<span>let</span> free <span>10</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>(<span>let</span> add-free (fn (n)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>                  (add free n)))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We must take care too that our static analysis pass can handle the case where a variable is free for part of a function’s body and bound for the rest. For example, the following program where <code>free</code> is in such a situation:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>(<span>let</span> free <span>10</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>(<span>let</span> add-half-free (fn (n)</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>                       (<span>let</span> free (div free <span>2</span>))</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>                       (add free n)))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once we understand those constraints, we can write a function to perform that analysis with some care. Here’s what I used in my lisp:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>pub</span>(<span>crate</span>) <span>fn</span> annotate_free_variables(f: &amp;<span>mut</span> LustFn) <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> bound: HashSet&lt;&amp;<span>String</span>&gt; = f.params.iter().collect();</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> free = <span>HashSet::</span>&lt;&amp;<span>String</span>&gt;::new();</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a>    <span>for</span> e <span>in</span> &amp;f.body <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a>        <span>let</span> (newbound, newfree) = analyze_variables(e);</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a>        <span>// Extend with the free variables found that do not have</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a>        <span>// bindings in our scope yet.</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a>        free.extend(newfree.difference(&amp;bound));</span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10"></a>        <span>// Once that is done add the new bound variables to our</span></span>
<span id="cb4-11"><a href="#cb4-11"></a>        <span>// scope. This needs to happen second so variables that are</span></span>
<span id="cb4-12"><a href="#cb4-12"></a>        <span>// free and bound in analyze_variables are added properly.</span></span>
<span id="cb4-13"><a href="#cb4-13"></a>        bound.extend(newbound);</span>
<span id="cb4-14"><a href="#cb4-14"></a>    <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb4-15"><a href="#cb4-15"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-16"><a href="#cb4-16"></a>    f.free_variables = free.into_iter().cloned().collect();</span>
<span id="cb4-17"><a href="#cb4-17"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>annotate_free_variables</code> takes a function as an argument and for each statement in its body calls <code>analyze_variables</code> to find the bound and unbound variables in it. Then, it merges them with its own bound and unbound variables and stores the result in the function. If you’re interested in how <code>analyze_variables</code> works you can take a look at it <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/lustc/blob/5f1ea67ac5463d94981e20f7e9ebdf4ed0ff1eaa/src/procedures.rs#L271-L312">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="compilation">Compilation</h2>
<p>In the Lisp that this is based on all functions are anonymous and leading up to the compilation of closures they are compiled as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Each function is collected into an object containing a unique name, its arguments, and its body.</li>
<li>The functions are lifted to the top of the program where they are compiled individually.</li>
<li>The source code is transformed so that each anonymous function compiled this way is replaced with a symbol containing its unique name.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is that a program like this:</p>

<p>Is transformed into a program like this:</p>

<p>In order to make these functions usable, whenever we encounter a symbol in the form <code>__anon_fn_0</code> we need to replace what would normally be a variable access with code to construct a closure containing a pointer to that function.</p>
<p>A closure is a heap allocated object that contains a pointer to the function it refers to and after that copies of all the values that function captures at the time of its construction. This memory representation is similar to the way an array is represented in C except instead of holding data it holds a pointer followed by the values of variables that are captured.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a>[fn_ptr, freevar_1, ..., freevar_N]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I’ll start by describing how closures are compiled and then describe how they can be called.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-closures">Compiling closures</h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a symbol that references a function we need to emit the code to create a closure on the heap. This is actually reasonably straightforward once we’ve done free variable annotation. In psudocode it looks something like this:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span># Lookup the free variables for this function</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>free_vars <span>=</span> lookup_free_vars(fn_name)</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a><span># Malloc enough space to store the closure</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a>closure_ptr <span>=</span> emit_malloc_words(<span>len</span>(free_vars) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><a href="#cb8-7"></a><span># Get the function pointer and store it as position 0 in the closure.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-8"><a href="#cb8-8"></a>fn_ptr <span>=</span> emit_get_fn_ptr(fn_name)</span>
<span id="cb8-9"><a href="#cb8-9"></a>emit_store(fn_ptr, closure_ptr, <span>0</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-10"><a href="#cb8-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-11"><a href="#cb8-11"></a><span>for</span> i, var <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span>(free_vars):</span>
<span id="cb8-12"><a href="#cb8-12"></a>    <span># Get and store the value at its position in the closure.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-13"><a href="#cb8-13"></a>    val <span>=</span> emit_var_access(var)</span>
<span id="cb8-14"><a href="#cb8-14"></a>    emit_store(val, closure_ptr, i)</span>
<span id="cb8-15"><a href="#cb8-15"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-16"><a href="#cb8-16"></a><span># Return the closure pointer for the caller to use.</span></span>
<span id="cb8-17"><a href="#cb8-17"></a><span>return</span> closure_ptr</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Admittedly this is an oversimplification of how this works, but I assume that if you’re at the point where you’re compiling closures you have variable bindings and heap allocations in your language and the <code>emit_</code> functions should already exist in some form or another.</p>
<h3 id="calling-closures">Calling closures</h3>
<p>Once we’re compiling closures we need some way to call them. To do this we’ll modify all of the functions that we compile to take an additional argument that is their closure. As part of the preamble of the function it’ll move over the values in its closure and store them in variables corresponding to their names.</p>
<p>In a lower level sense this is to say: in the body of functions lookup free variables inside of the closure pointer passed to the function instead of the stack or wherever function arguments and local variables are normally stored.</p>
<p>Once that is done, the code for emitting a function call is as simple as this:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a>fn_ptr <span>=</span> emit_load(closure_ptr, <span>0</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a><span># Push the functions arguments to the stack</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a>emit_push_fn_args()</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a><span># Push the closure pointer to the stack</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a>emit_push_closure_ptr()</span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8"></a>emit_call_indirect(fn_ptr)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This stuff can be daunting. It took me a ton
    of <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/semistack">experimentation</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/llvm-kaleidoscope">tutorials</a>
    and an
    entire <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/fa20/">compilers
    course</a> to work out how it all works. Even then I'm just
    starting to dip my toes into it all. If you're interested in writing your own compiler I highly reccomend taking a look at <a href="http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2006/11-ghuloum.pdf">An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction</a> which helped me add some structure to my efforts.
  </p>
  <p>The Lisp I'm working on that this is based on is built on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/simplejit-demo">Cranelift's JIT</a>. Thus far I'm enjoying it quite a lot and it has been a nice excuse to really try and learn Rust. The performance seems to be quite good as well thus far which is an added bonus.</p>
<p>While pretty high level hopefully this has helped to demystify some of the methodology for adding closures to your compiled language. If you’d like to browse through some real code for doing this, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/lustc/commit/26f97e1fd3e5ba55952e2853186e794aa7eafc51">these</a> <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/lustc/commit/e8d4925b29c7c1ab7ddc4fb0e52a067fc1edd87d">three</a> <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/lustc/commit/5f1ea67ac5463d94981e20f7e9ebdf4ed0ff1eaa">commits</a> in my Lisp compiler or browse the entire repository <a href="https://github.com/ZekeMedley/lustc">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’d like to share the results of one of the most interesting management experiments I’ve been a part of. At a company I worked at recently, we implemented the Single Threaded Owner (STO) model from Amazon, where you have everyone on the team report to a single leader, including product, design, and engineering. You can think of the STO model as a more extreme form of cross-functional teams, where the team has everything it needs to deliver on its mission. </p>
<h3>Single Threaded Owner Definition</h3>
<p>The idea of the Single Threaded Owner comes from Amazon. The name itself is based on the idea of a team focusing on a single thing at a time (i.e., instead of multi-tasking, you are focusing on a single thread of work or focus at a time). At Amazon, each team is supposed to have a clear area of ownership (a product area, based on a customer need) that they obsess about all the time. A leader of a team is called a “Single Threaded Owner”, or STO. </p>

<p>The most common alternative to the STO model is what I call the “3 legged stool” model. In the 3 legged stool model, you have separate leadership hierarchies for Engineering, Product, and Design. Design sometimes reports to Product. But you then assemble a team of engineers, led by an Engineering Manager, with an embedded Product Manager and usually a Designer. The two or three of them become a sort of local leadership team. </p>

<p>In the STO model, they actually all report in and are part of the same team. Everyone reports to the STO.</p>
<h3>What was the motivation?</h3>
<p>We were seeing a lack of alignment across engineering and product, and we were about to do a reorganization that aligned the teams along clearer areas of ownership. We had a lot of ex-Amazon employees, including the CEO, and they thought combining the reorg with having a single leader responsible for that area would improve things.</p>
<p>At a previous company, I had noticed some pathologies from maintaining separate hierarchies between Product, Design, and Engineering. Reorgs were frequently done in incompatible ways, with Product organizing along one line, and Engineering on another. Or they would be done in one organization, but poorly coordinated, so they would result in a series of reorgs across the different organizations. </p>
<p>On the local teams, I often saw issues where the engineering manager (EM) and product manager (PM) didn’t work well together, and these teams tended to do quite poorly. Generally what would happen is their managers would attempt to “coach them through it”, but what would happen in practice is that those teams would just not work effectively for six months or more.</p>
<p>So even before I heard of the Single Threaded Owner model, it was something I had been advocating for.  </p>
<h3>How did we set it up?</h3>
<p>One factor we had to decide is who would be the Single Threaded Owner. Would it be Product, or Engineering? This is a pretty tricky matter. This is how I saw the tradeoffs:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Product manager as STO
   </td>
   <td>Engineering manager as STO
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Typically has better business and product context, which allows them to set direction more effectively. 
   </td>
   <td>More experienced managing people and process. Essentially more suited to be an “organizational” or “organizing” leader. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Stereotypically: like a mini-CEO who is also a poor manager.
   </td>
   <td>Stereotypically: like a mini-COO who lacks business context.
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>I made the calculation that a good people manager can work around their lack of expertise by using the skills of the people on their team. And it is harder for a person with less people management skills to compensate for the lack of that skillset. A product manager is less likely to have the people management and organizational skills, so I decided to have the PMs report to engineering. A better heuristic is: whoever is the better organizational and people leader should be the STO. The ideal skillset is an experienced people manager who also can act as a product and process leader. I found out later from Ben Bernard that this is how it works at Amazon. </p>
<p>We had four teams: two product teams, an agent team, and an infra team. All four teams were 3-4 people, which concerned us as they seemed too small. </p>
<p>After the reorganization, we ended up with three larger teams. We changed the Engineering Managers to be Single Threaded Owners, and changed the reporting so that the Designer and Product Manager for each team reported in to the new Single Threaded Owner. I acted as the manager of managers, which made me a Single Threaded Owner for all product development, and responsible for Engineering, Product, and Design. We had a Senior Director of Product, who reported to me and focused on high-level product strategy.</p>
<p>Although this violated the Single Threaded Owner, we had a group of three principal engineers that reported outside of this hierarchy to the CTO. They were embedded on each team, and spent most of their time with the team. This served as an architectural group.</p>
<p>Some other changes we made at the same time were to introduce weekly metrics review meetings, where the STOs and PMs would present what they had learned and were monitoring in their areas, based on metrics they tracked. We set up a monthly business review meeting which served as an interface between executive and local teams. </p>
<p>The monthly business review meetings were a chance for the team to align on direction with executives and other stakeholders. The intention was for direction to be set by each team, within a larger strategy defined by the senior product manager. </p>
<h3>What was the result?</h3>
<p>Our results were mixed. </p>
<p>One team flourished with the STO model, and became one of the best performing teams I’ve seen in my career. Although the team composition changed slightly, most of the team members came from a previous team, and that team had delivered a couple of lackluster projects. Spirits were low as we went into the reorg. </p>
<p>I believe there were two aspects to the change that really clicked: one is that the new leadership group for the team was a strong combination. But it seems like the Single Threaded Owner model made that combination even stronger:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Single Threaded Owner (STO), PM, principal engineer, and designer were very aligned. I would hear the same message from each of them, presenting fundamentally a united perspective. They were more strategically aligned than most any local team I’ve worked with.</li>
<li>They took greater ownership of their domain and began challenging some of the product direction they were “given”. They successfully pivoted the team’s direction to something they thought more important, and got the leadership team on board with those changes. </li>
<li>The team became incredibly productive and incremental, to the point that they started delivering things to customers every couple of weeks. They went from having a lot of monolithic releases that weren’t released on a schedule, to releasing increments of their larger projects in ways that were useful, all the way to the customer. They did this frequently, so frequently that people stopped caring about the timelines. But they also met their timelines consistently, to the point that they were usually within a few days of their objective, and were sometimes early.</li>
<li>Their work took on a different nature than it had previously. Instead of delivering large projects every couple of months, they prioritized a lot of small followup projects. They would often learn new information from customers and make a small 1-2 week project that would start the next week. I believe this resulted in much better software for customers: they were more focused on the <em>outcomes</em> for customers than they were previously. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how the STO (Alexa Stefanko) described her experience:</p>
<p><span color="#770099">I loved it. If I could be an STO forever, I would. It made me better, it made our team better. I felt inspired, excited, challenged, and invested in a way I had not felt before. I loved that my decisions had an obvious and tangible impact. My biggest takeaway was that it made my previous antipatterns unacceptable. By that I mean that my weaknesses (relationships with PM, technical oversight, lack of market awareness) were no longer tolerable in that role. I had to take all of those weaknesses and turn them into either non-hurtful things or strengths quickly. It taught me how to have excellent and productive relationships with my PM, for example. Which had been something I had struggled with.</span></p><p><span color="#770099">
<p>It also forced all of my leadership team to be on the exact same page all the time. With everything going through me, we were able to challenge each other on assumptions that were not shared. Our forced alignment meant that our team received clear and consistent direction.</p>
</span></p><p><span color="#770099">While I think our data was often insufficient (and I wish we acknowledged that more often), I loved having to be so in tune with the success or failure of our products. I felt very confident in the decisions that we were making, and felt even more confident in our ability to course correct if we had done something wrong.</span></p>
<p>The second team didn’t take quite as well. The Engineering Manager felt like the new role was a huge increase in responsibility, and felt unsupported by their Product Manager. Because one of the challenges their team was having was around product direction, this ended up being a big issue for the STO.</p>
<p>The best thing you could say about the STO model is that it made it completely obvious that it wasn’t working. The PM ended up leaving, and the situation started to improve. The biggest benefit there was that the problems were more visible and obvious than they were previously, and the EM was able to take action to improve the situation. However, the EM did report that the whole experience was incredibly stressful. </p>
<h3>What did we learn?</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges with the STO model is that it asks people to forgo their identity as engineers or product managers. There was constant friction from product and design about them feeling like the STO model gave them …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>So, let's start the discussion with a graph, and then I'll explain what it means and where it came from:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/herd_imm_check.png"></p>
<p>Each point on this graph is one of the states, and the red ellipse shows where North and South Dakota are.  The x axis shows the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in that state, since the beginning of the pandemic (per the CDC data, as pulled from John Hopkins' excellent <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">github repository of covid-19 info</a>).  The Dakotas have had total confirmed cases in the neighborhood of 12% of their population.</p>
<p>The y axis, is comparing the most recent 7 days to the worst week (in that state) in the last 3 months.  So, for example, Texas (currently peaking) looks like this:<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/Texas_ConfirmedCases.png">
</p><p>Therefore, Texas has a "1.0" on the y-axis, since the most recent 7 days are the highest level seen in the last 12 weeks (the current wave).  New York, Louisiana, New Jersey, Hawaii, and a lot of other states are also at 1.0.  However, some states like Illinois are at a lower level (in this case, 0.486).<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/Illinois_ConfirmedCases.png"></p>
<p>Note that the peaks for Texas and Illinois are not quite the same; Illinois' was a little higher, as a percent of the population.  Different states have different populations, but also different population densities, and it's harder to stop an epidemic if people are living cheek by jowl in the same apartment building, for example.  So each state is compared to the peak (worst) week for that state (out of the last 12), with 1.0 meaning the most recent week is the worst they've seen, and lower numbers meaning that it has gotten better than that.  Here's what North and South Dakota look like.</p>
<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/North_Dakota_ConfirmedCases.png">
<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/South_Dakota_ConfirmedCases.png">

<h2>What Does This Mean?</h2>
<p>Now, the fact that states with higher total confirmed cases, are seeing fewer cases now (per capita, compared to their peak in the last 3 months) is not in itself surprising.  That's the way pandemics normally work.  The fire burns through most of the dry tinder, and then it goes out.  What is surprising is that we are seeing this already with a number as low as ~12%, as in the Dakotas.  How can a number that low lead to herd immunity?</p>
<p>One thing that should be mentioned here is that "herd immunity" has nothing to do with "culling the herd", and also does not mean that every single member of the "herd" is immune.  What it means is that the percentage of the population that are immune, is too high for an epidemic to be self-sustaining.  If another person gets sick, most of the people they expose to the virus are already resistant, and not enough people get sick to keep things going.  It's kind of like how the ash left behind after a campfire is not all, completely 100% consumed; there is often still more fuel there.  But enough of it was turned to ash, that the fire was not self-sustaining.  Once a population has reached "herd immunity", new exposures to the virus sputter and die out quickly.  The odd thing is, that this should happen with a number as low as 12%.</p>
<p>One possibility, is that the previous estimates of needing 70% of the population to be resistant before you reach herd immunity, were simply incorrect.  A lot depends on who exactly gets it, and if the people who are "super-spreaders" (people with service industry jobs who interact with a lot of other people in a day, for example) are also the first to get it (not an unreasonable guess), then the number could be a lot lower.  If your 12% includes all the potential super-spreaders, maybe 12% is enough.  That would be hard to manage, though, and my guess is that's not what's going on here.</p>
<p>The main issue is that not all people who get infected with covid-19, get this confirmed with a test.  Some of them are asymptomatic, and never know they are infected.  Some are not very sick, and don't get tested because there's no reason for them to (they're just going to stay home, regardless).  Some people are afraid to know the truth.  There may also be a few people who get counted more than once, if they get tested multiple times and test positive each time.  So, we need a way to guess at the ratio of confirmed cases (including those who are double-counted), to actual cases (with no double-counting).</p>
<p>Estimates of the actual mortality rate for covid-19 are contentious, but <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf">John Ioannidis published a paper</a> which collected together many different seroprevalence studies, to estimate something like 0.23% of people who get covid-19 will die from it.  He points out that it could be different for different regions, though, either because of different strains or differences in the local population or healthcare response, so let's take an estimate of twice that for the U.S., or 0.46%.  At about the same time as the data was collected (April and May), the U.S. had .05% confirmed cases per week, and 0.0015% deaths per week.</p>
<pre>actual cases         .000015 deaths
------------    *    ---------------------    ===&gt;   6.52 actual cases per confirmed case
.0046 deaths         .0005 confirmed cases
</pre>
<p>It would be nice to have some kind of double-check of this ratio.  Fortunately, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30948-8/fulltext">Slovakia provided one</a>.  "The country made international headlines as, over the last weekend of October, Slovak authorities tested almost all the country's adult population for coronavirus. A total of 3.6 million people out of an estimated 4 million target population were tested that weekend with a countrywide positivity rate of 1.06%."  Given that the test was (necessarily, being cheap and capable of being deployed on such a massive scale) not as accurate as more conventional tests, the rate may have been as high as 2%.  Given that conventional measures ("confirmed cases") was around 0.25%, that would give us a ratio of actual cases to confirmed cases somewhere in the range of 4-8.</p>
<p>Now, neither of these numbers are super-precise, and in any case, we should not expect the ratio of confirmed cases to actual cases to be the same everywhere.  Different governments and different healthcare systems would be expected to result in a different likelihood for a person who is actually infected with covid-19, to go get tested to confirm it.  But the fact that both methods, based on different datasets in different countries, provide similar answers, is encouraging that we are somewhere in the ballpark.  For every "confirmed case", we have something like 4-8 people who have actually been infected with covid-19.</p>
<p>Now, the results in the Dakotas start to be less surprising.</p>
<p>If the number of confirmed cases per capita is 12.545% (North Dakota) or 11.862% (South Dakota), then the actual percentage of the population that have been infected is more like 70%.  No wonder they have seen a precipitous decline in new cases in both states.  But what about other states?</p>
<p>At the bottom of this web page, you will see a table of all of the states (plus D.C., Puerto Rico, etc.), and their total confirmed cases as a fraction of their total population.  It also has the ratio of the most recent 7 days confirmed cases, to the worst week that state has had in the last 12 weeks (i.e. is it currently declining from its recent peak, or is it setting new record highs in which case it will be at 1.0).  But if you want to look at them all in one graph, to see the overall trend, here it is again:<img src="https://www.rosshartshorn.net/stuffrossthinksabout/dakota_immunity/herd_imm_check.png"></p>
<p>Note that, not only are the Dakotas very low (recently), but also all of the states with something like 10% cases per capita, are declining (numbers lower than 1).  In fact, it appears that once a state hits 8%, it will start to have declining numbers of new cases each week.  If 8% confirmed cases means something more like 48% of population having been already infected with the virus, this is not too surprising.</p>
<h2>Does This Mean It's Too Late For The Vaccine?</h2>
<p>Well, it depends on what you think the vaccine is for.  If you think it is to end the current pandemic, and we were all hiding out so that we would not get infected until the vaccine showed up, then yes, I'm afraid it means that the vaccine is probably showing up just too late to help with that (especially if you have to get both doses before you are immune).  If you live in a state like Hawaii, Maine, or Vermont, with a total confirmed cases far below the levels of the Dakotas, then perhaps the vaccine may save some people even in this pandemic.  Given that all of these states are experiencing record or near-record levels of new confirmed cases, though, I have my doubts.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that currently North and South Dakota are two of the top three states in getting the vaccine rolled out.  However, since they have only gotten about 5% of the population (and that's counting people who have only gotten one dose), I doubt that it is the main factor driving the recent decline.  But it sure doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>But vaccines developed in response to a new virus have never showed up in time to help much with the first pandemic, so that is not really a knock on the people who developed these.  We have had measles, mumps, rubella, etc. for many decades, and we still have to get vaccinated, because even though there's no pandemic of those three currently (knock on wood), we know they are still out there, and will eventually return.  Vaccines help us to avoid repeating this whole pandemic every 20 years or so (for every virus), once there are enough people born after the last wave to provide "fresh fuel" for the fire.  Given how stupid and crazy this pandemic has made people, I think we can all be thankful for that.</p>

        - January 8, 2021
          - tagged with: #docker #docker-compose #tools #containers #project setup       </p>
    </header>

    <p>After clarifying why <a href="https://picostitch.com/tidbits/2021/01/why-i-use-docker-for-every-project/">I use Docker for every project I set up</a>
let me try to clarify also: <strong>Why would I use a docker-compose setup over a single Dockerfile setup?</strong>
I had been doing the single Dockerfile setup for quite a while. 
I was doing a lot of manual work, that made the setup work. But I don't regret it, it taught me a lot!
But that was not sustainable, and it didn't scale.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="how-i-automate-every-projects-setup">How I Automate every Projects' Setup</h2>
<p>My setup with one docker container always contained a <a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/site-stitcher/blob/76ba1541673a156d5cd944241ea7f29200fffeb5/run.sh"><code>run.sh</code> file</a>,
and a <code>Dockerfile</code>.
The <code>run.sh</code> file grew over time and taught me a lot of bash, but docker-compose does all I need without any bash scripting. 
More about that in a bit. 
The <code>run.sh</code> had the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>start and enter a container</strong> - via <code>./run.sh bash</code> I built, started, entered a container and landed on the command line inside that container</li>
<li><strong>enter a running container</strong> - the above command also detected if a container was already running and just entered it, 
basically opening a second shell inside the container (via <code>docker exec</code>)</li>
<li><strong>build the image on demand</strong> - when I changed the <code>Dockerfile</code> (the definition of the container) docker needs to rebuild
the container, my <code>run.sh</code> did this (more or less well) on demand</li>
<li><strong>configure the docker runtime</strong> - when running a docker container you might need to expose a port (for a web server running inside the container)
or you need to map a folders into the container, so you can work with the files inside the container.
All these things were inside my <code>run.sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="docker-compose-ftw">docker-compose ftw</h2>
<p>Long story short: docker-compose does all that. A bit different, maybe not as convinient, but in a standardized and 
consistent way. Additionally docker-compose does it for any number of containers!</p>
<p>For using <code>docker-compose</code> I use <a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/site-stitcher/blob/76ba1541673a156d5cd944241ea7f29200fffeb5/docker-compose.yml">this <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file</a>.
All things I configured in my <code>run.sh</code> before are in this file. 
Using <code>docker-compose</code> I do the above like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>start and enter a container</strong> - this needs two commands with <code>docker-compose</code>, 1) <code>docker-compose up -d</code> starts
the container(s) in the background and 2) <code>docker-compose exec &lt;name&gt; bash</code> opens a bash in the container with <code>&lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><strong>enter a running container</strong> - just like before, <code>docker-compose exec &lt;name&gt; bash</code> opens a bash in the container with <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>
the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is defined in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file as the service's name</li>
<li><strong>build the image on demand</strong> - <code>docker-compose build</code> this builds all docker containers as needed,
<code>docker-compose build --pull</code> will try to find newer docker images, e.g. when you just used the image "node"</li>
<li><strong>configure the docker runtime</strong> - all the configuration of mapping ports or volumes are done in the
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, normally located at the root of the project's directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/site-stitcher/tree/5381c9776c265e48d6f903f5019f02d9b64cda6c#develop-run-locally">README.md</a>
I also described how I am using <code>docker-compose</code> for this project.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>I am quite happy with that setup now. Every project works the same.
I am thinking of using the same name "app" for the main container, so I can always do
<code>docker-compose exec app bash</code> to enter the app (or main) container.
This could make it even more unified and easier.
The <a href="https://github.com/wolframkriesing/site-stitcher/blob/76ba1541673a156d5cd944241ea7f29200fffeb5/docker-compose.yml"><code>docker-compose.yml</code> file</a>
I use for this site the container is called "picostitch" right now, which I need
to know. Not as ideal as using "app" every time.</p>

January 18, 2021 | https://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/selearning/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/selearning/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>I have come to the conclusion that <em>Software Engineering is primarily a learning endeavour, the working code is rather a side effect</em>.</p>
<p>This quote is actually not mine but I am paraphrasing Alberto Brandolini who is making this very point in <a href="https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming">Event Storming</a> (he was actually talking about Software Development, but I do not want to get into an academic discussion on the differences between Software <em>Engineering</em> and <em>Development</em> and I am treating them as being equal here).</p>
<p>I have actually always been thinking of Software Engineering (SE) as a learning process, but it was only until I read Brandolinins <em>Event Storming</em> where I found this view expressed in such clarity, which also made it clear to me that I, myself have been seeing SE in this very way. In short: for any non-trivial SE project, the main challenge is understanding the domain, which is primarily a learning process. This view is also very prominent in the Domain-Driven Design community and was expressed by Eric Evans himself: <em>The critical complexity of most software projects is in understanding the domain itself.</em></p>
<p>It is no surprise that agile processes have been proven to be so successful and useful: they emphasise <strong>collective learning</strong>. What is even better is that agile is a very scientific approach to SE: we fornulate hypotheses from discussions (among developers <strong>and</strong> customer) and then test them in experiments to arrive at new insights and deeper understanding. Plan-based processes on the other hand are a rather inductive aproach, based on many assumptions which are not tested and verified until the very end (just ask yourself: would you approach your Ph.D. in that way?)</p>
<p>When we finally acknowledge that SE is a learning process then we need to structure the methodologies, processes, tools and technologies around it to create an environment where quick, shared learning can happen through continuous experimentation and feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight requirements allowing for quick understanding of the domain and what and why to implement for whom: <em>Impact Maps (Godzic), Event Storming (Brandolini), User Stories, User Story Mapping (Patton)</em>.</li>
<li>A lightweight development and engineering process with emphasis on collective learning through continuous feedback: Agile / <em>Scrum</em> with <em>eXtreme Programming</em> (XP) practices.</li>
<li>A suitable design methodology which emphasises collective learning and experiments: <em>Domain-Driven Design</em></li>
<li>The most suitable architecture for the problem at hand, found by applying careful prototyping.</li>
<li>A programming language which makes it easier to map the domain into code: object-oriented, something along <em>Java, C#</em>,… (I am actually going to do research on using Haskell for that, but that is a topic for another post)</li>
<li>Technology which lets developers focus on the learning of the domain instead of dealing with low-level plumbing: <em>Spring, Thymeleaf, REST, React/Angular/Vue/…, Hibernate, Web, Mobile, IDEs</em>,…</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my firm belief that learning SE requires to apply it in the same way as learning a programming language requires us to apply it. Yes, when learning how to program we have books and slides and lecture notes describing the language and concepts but they always come with exercises. It is a mystery to me how we can write SE books which ignore that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the SE textbooks I have read and studied (I had a fair share of them…) seems to embrace all of the above in any deeper way, and just throws a checklist of the usual topics at the reader in a rather very academic, dry and boring way. These books seem to treat SE simply as a collection of methodologies, processes, tools and technologies as a means to an end in itself which need to be applied <em>somehow</em>. A student who works through them has acquired lot of book knowledge about SE but has no clue how to <strong>really</strong> put it together and how the knowledge <strong>really</strong> relates to real-world SE. Even worse, the idea that SE is a learning process is not communicated in any of the SE textbooks I know. I think one of the main reason this is the case is that all these books have been written a long time ago and have only been extended with “newer” topics such as Agile / Web / Cloud / Whatever but have been sticking to the same end 90s/early 2000s SE mindset (just think about it: <em>Sommerville</em> is in its 10th edition now…),</p>
<p>Therefore, it is my aim to write a textbook book on applied, modern SE which is going to embrace all discussed issues above - I feel it is a very much needed textbook. It will be based on my teaching experience from my SE course at the FHV, paired with real-world experience from myself and industry partners. At the moment it is just a vision in my head but I want to get into it as soon as possible. Uunfortunately not before Spring 2022 as I will be occupied with a heavy load of teaching until then but this will give me enough time to earn more experience in teaching SE and reflecting my approach to the book which I will share in future posts.</p>

<p>With the world in lockdown, most "white-collar" crime (AKA "world-destroying corruption and looting") now takes place over Zoom. If you witness such a crime, you might be tempted to record the meeting and leak it to a journalist.</p>
<p>But leaking Zoom recordings is seriously fraught because they are full of personally identifying details. Some of these are "traitor-tracing" mechanisms, others are intrinsic to Zoom, and still others come from your end of the recording.</p>
<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/leak-zoom-meeting/">https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/leak-zoom-meeting/</a></p>
<p>Nikita Mazurov's guide to anonymizing Zoom videos for The Intercept tackles each of these classes of identifiers.</p>
<p>Traitor-tracing: Zoom meeting hosts have the option to add visual and audio watermarks to their videos.</p>
<p>The visual ones are perceptible – displaying your name/email on the screen so that it will be present in any video-grab – but the audio watermarks are a series of ultrasound chirps with unique identifiers in them.</p>
<p>It's not clear where the audio watermark is inserted; Marzurov hypothesizes that the ultrasonic watermarks are inserted by your copy of the Zoom client, so using an external recording tool might bypass them.</p>
<p>Another important identifier in Zoom recordings is the arrangement of the other participants; this is different for every viewer.</p>
<p>Any recording will reveal information that could identify the leaker: not just the user's OS, but also pop-up alerts about emails and messages.</p>
<p>Source protection with Zoom captures is really hard – but that's all the more reason for this discussion to take place in earnest.</p>

<p>When I think about our historical, profound shifts in attitude and discourse, the model I apply is "peak indifference."</p>
<p>Say you have real, existential problem. More often than not, these are systemic problems, and those are the hardest problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2016/07/cory-doctorow-peak-indifference/">https://locusmag.com/2016/07/cory-doctorow-peak-indifference/</a></p>
<p>Not just because systemic problems involve collective action (you can't recycle your way out of climate change), but because the cause-and-effect relationships of systemic problems can't be easily known, so it's hard to know what you need to do to avert the problem.</p>
<p>Systemic problems pose a third difficulty: they enrich small minorities, and those minorities can exploit causal ambiguity to deliberately sow doubt.</p>
<p>To make that more concrete: think about cancer-tobacco denial.</p>
<p>Not everyone who smokes gets cancer. When it does give you cancer, the tumor comes years after the puff that damages your genes. There's lots of social pressure to smoke, and getting your friends to quit is even harder than quitting yourself.</p>
<p>And on top of all of it, the tobacco industry made tons of money from giving us cancer, and they could use some of that to fund doubt-merchants who deliberately worsened the difficulty in linking smoking and cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://timharford.com/2015/04/cigarettes-damn-cigarettes-and-statistics/">https://timharford.com/2015/04/cigarettes-damn-cigarettes-and-statistics/</a></p>
<p>But denial doesn't make problems disappear – it just incurs policy debt, and the interest on that debt is human suffering. Climate inaction, tobacco inaction, and inequality inaction only delay the day of reckoning, and make it worse when it arrives.</p>
<p>That's where peak denial comes in. Over time, the mounting harms from policy debt make it harder and harder to deny the problem, At a certain point – long before we take action – the number of people who deny the problem starts to decline.</p>
<p>This happens naturally, without any need for activist urging. The problem is that the natural peak denial point is often several steps beyond the point of no return. And that's when denial slides into nihilism:</p>
<p>Here's what nihilism looks like:</p>
<p>"Well, I guess these things <em>did</em> give me stage 4 lung cancer after all. No point in quitting now."</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>"You were right, rhino populations are in danger! But since there's only one left, let's find out what he tastes like?"</p>
<p>That's why we can't wait for peak denial to arise on its own, why we must hasten its arrival – because we want people to engage with systemic problems <em>before</em> the point of no return.</p>
<p>That's where storytelling comes in.</p>
<p>Stories are a fuggly hack, an illusion played on our empathy, wherein we're fooled into caring about the literally inconsequential fate of made-up people (your breakfast yogurt's death was more tragic than Romeo and Juliet's, for it was once alive).</p>
<p><a href="https://locusmag.com/2014/11/cory-doctorow-stories-are-a-fuggly-hack/">https://locusmag.com/2014/11/cory-doctorow-stories-are-a-fuggly-hack/</a></p>
<p>But still, made up stories that make vivid and visceral the consequences of inaction can spur us into action, can create a vocabulary for discussing the lived experience of people in a future that has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Even better than stories, though, are <em>histories</em>, the real stories of real people who really suffered through real experiences comparable to those that we face on our horizon. Hence "those who forget history are doomed to repeat it."</p>
<p>We're very good at forgetting history. The arrival of the covid pandemic was filled with stories of the dimly remembered 1918 influenza pandemic. Our failure to heed those warnings triggered tales of its brutal second wave the following winter.</p>
<p>Herp derp.</p>
<p>Starting in 1968, successive US presidents began to dismantle Glass-Steigel, a corrective put in place after a horrendous finance sector collapse that triggered the Great Depression and WWII. Not one president heeded historians' warnings about the consequences.</p>
<p>Derp.</p>
<p>Dismantling the checks on finance led to successive, worsening crises followed by crushing austerity a deepening inequality. Historical warnings about how this cycle ends with guillotines and Reichstag fires were ignored.</p>
<p>Derp derp derp.</p>
<p>The ideology of finance is a subset of right-wing thought, defined by Corey Robin (in "The Reactionary Mind") as the belief that some people are born to rule, while the rest are born to be ruled over.</p>
<p><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001</a></p>
<p>This belief has many guises (Dominionism, imperialism, racism, monarchism, fascism, libertarianism) but they all boil down to one thing: eugenics.</p>
<p>It's one thing to believe that markets are meritocratic during a moment of dynamism, when the low-born can rise to riches.</p>
<p>But when their offspring pull up the ladder and social mobility halts, "meritocracy" becomes hereditary: markets elevate the best people, and the best people are all descended from the wealthy, so the wealthy must be of better stock (cue Trump and his talk of "good blood").</p>
<p>Eugenics was once a mainstream American doctrine, and American eugenicists inspired Nazi "race science." But after the Holocaust, eugenics fell into disrepute and we dropped it down the same memory hole that the 1918 flu disappeared into.</p>
<p>But eugenics made a comeback under another guise: the "human capital theory," which holds that markets reward us in proportion to our value to society, and thus the CEO is paid 10,000x more than the janitor because the CEO provides 10,000x more value to the human project.</p>
<p>Eugenics isn't just repugnant, it's also wrong. To understand why, you have to understand how desirable traits are social, not isolated in individuals.</p>
<p>Blair Fix's essay on the link between eugenics and human capitol theory is a must-read:</p>
<p><a href="https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2021/01/14/the-rise-of-human-capital-theory/">https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2021/01/14/the-rise-of-human-capital-theory/</a></p>
<p>By way of illustration, Fix describes geneticist William Muir's experiments with improving chicken egg-production through artificial selection, in which he only bred the best layers. The result? A disaster. Egg-laying plummeted.</p>
<p>It plummeted because laying isn't an isolated trait. Chickens that produced the most eggs did so by bullying other chickens out of <em>their</em> feed and resources. Selecting for laying selected for bullying and aggression and led to endless chicken-fights and no eggs.</p>
<p>When Muir bred another flock of chickens based on a <em>group</em>'s ability to lay, <em>then</em> he got his eggs. Egg-laying is a social process.</p>
<p>This story will be familiar to anyone who's worked in a stack-ranked software development shop.</p>
<p>Software managers have long noted that some coders can turn in 10X or even 100X more code than their median colleagues. But attempts to build "superstar" teams that fired all the median programmers end in chaos and destruction.</p>
<p>If your 100X programmer is such a dick that no one can work with them, then their aptitude is irrelevant – you'll never ship.</p>
<p>I assume there are analogies to this in the sporting world, but I am vastly unqualified to discuss sports of any kind.</p>
<p>Despite the bankruptcy of human capital theory, the systemic dangers it posed, and the obvious fact that it was just eugenics dressed up as economics, the theory festered for decades, poisoning our world.</p>
<p>The C-suites of every major company are filled with hens whose egg-laying prowess is the result of their suppression of their peers' efficacy – while others whose social integration make them far more productive are relegated to worse jobs or forced out altogether.</p>
<p>The lockdown provoked squeals of outrage from the world's wealthiest people, who insisted that the factories be re-opened. As the slogan of the day went, "If a billionaire needs you to go to work to maintain his fortune, then you are the source of that fortune – not him."</p>
<p>We can't afford to be indifferent to any of our systemic problems any more: not climate science, nor inequality, nor monopoly, nor the …</p></div></article></div>

<h2><span id="The_problem_with_writing_advice">The problem with writing advice</span></h2>



<p>The problem with the likes of Steven Pinker and Helen Sword is that they like their own writing way too much. But I don’t. Like their writing, that is. [1] I want to get some information from them and I want to get examples and counterexamples for the points they make. I want them to get to the point. I am not reading them for enjoyment, that’s what fiction is for. I am reading them to learn what they have to say and I have to wade through a morass of stories, pointless metaphors, geysers of words. They are aiming for eloquence but effluence would be a better term for what their reader gets.</p>



<p>Of course, they get high praise and esteem from their peers, everybody wants to write like Pinker, Gladwell or Sword. And obviously many people buy and read their books. So they must be doing something right. But my claim is that they focus far too much of crafting their sentences and far too little time on crafting their advice.</p>



<p>And what’s worse, they promote an environment where ‘writing well’ with style or panache is seen as a virtue. People are praised for that sort of writing and others are encouraged to emulate them. Sentences like “This was so well written, why can’t more academics write like this” proliferate. But it misidentifies the problem. When academic writing is bad, it is not because of the opacity of prose but rather because of the paucity of scrupulous argumentation.</p>



<h2><span id="Defending_academic_writing">Defending academic writing</span></h2>



<p>The complaint that academic writing is needlessly dense and abstruse has become a cliche and gets far too little examination. Nobody (except many frustrated readers) is officially complaining that non-fiction writing is needlessly flowery and sprawling across many more pages than necessary. It prides itself on taking the reader on a journey of discovery but it’s actually all smoke and mirrors.</p>



<p>There is only one criterion that we should require of academic writing and that is the same requirement we should have of academic thinking. Scruples. Scrupulous writing will let the reader in on the uncertainty of knowledge, and messiness of the process of how knowledge is created. It will not try to write a press-release while presenting its argument. And it will not waste the reader’s time by taking them on a journey. Starting every single point it wants to make with a story!</p>



<h2><span id="Starting_with_academic_reading">Starting with academic reading</span></h2>



<p>Academic writing needs to start with the recognition of what academic reading looks like. The vast majority of academic writing is not read like fiction or popular non-fiction. It is read to get the piece of information one needs or to get a gist of what the overall point is. So, having a clear outline with descriptive titles would be much more important than removing unnecessary adverbs. Having an abstract that summarises the key points made in bullet points helps more than using active verbs. Using vocabulary appropriate to the needs of the audience is much more useful than trying to avoid jargon or acronyms.</p>



<p>The first advice you need to give to an academic writer is not to read a book on stylish writing but rather to read how people in their field are writing. Because those are their potential readers. And in their writing, we see what they are expecting. So anything written in the manner they expect will make reading easier for them. Because there is no academic writing as such, there is only writing within disciplines and communities. And barging into a community and trying to change what it’s doing without invitation is not stylish, it is rude. [2]</p>



<p>Why are people reading and why are people writing? They are reading to discover the argument that the author is putting forward. And they are writing to put debate the arguments of others and to put forth more of their own. Their success in doing so should be our primary criterion. The success of academic writing is not some abstract readability score but the ability of the peers to identify and debate the argument it puts forward. [3]</p>



<h2><span id="Practical_advice_on_composition_Shorter_sentences">Practical advice on composition: Shorter sentences</span></h2>



<p>This is where we can give some practical advice. And the advice can be summarised in 3 words: 1. Write 2. shorter 3. sentences. Ignore everything about passives, jargon, conversational writing, whatever else the latest guide puts forward. Focus on keeping your average sentence to about 15 words. Not every sentence has to be that short but if you keep the average somewhere between 15 and 20 words, your writing will be easier to read.</p>



<p>Keeping sentences short is not only good for the reader, it is also good for the writer. Often a long sentence means muddled thought. If I find a sentence I wrote that’s longer than say 30 words, I often also find that the thought behind it is not clear enough. I had an idea in my mind that had too many assumptions and I had not put enough work into parsing out all the connections.</p>



<p>But not always, sometimes a longer sentence is better for both the writer and the reader. Text that is easy to understand is cohesive as well as coherent and too many short clauses will lack cohesion. The reader needs to know which things link together and making that explicit will make the text better.</p>



<p>The good news is that sentence length is easy to check without having to learn opaque grammatical concepts. We know that <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html">people most exercised about passives</a> are least likely to actually spot them in the sentence. So why should we expect normal writers to pay attention to parts of speech or fine details of sentence structure. But anybody can paste their text into the free <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Writer</a> and see if they can shorten the sentences highlighted in red.[4] Doing it regularly will also give you a chance to focus on how sentences are put together.</p>



<h2><span id="Structure_is_king_Rich_outlines">Structure is king: Rich outlines</span></h2>



<p>If you really care about your readers, make sure you make the outline of your writing explicit. Don’t just mark the normal sections like: Introduction or Conclusions. That is helpful for navigation but not understanding. Put headings inside these sections and have them every few paragraphs to summarise what you’re trying to say in those paragraphs. This will aid readers who are not reading your text in sequence to get the gist and also not to miss important points.</p>



<p>You may complain about the youths today not spending enough time on deep reading, but paradoxically, if the structure is marked clearly enough, people are likely to read more of the actual text, as well, because it breaks the work into smaller chunks. Particularly students or novices are often horrified by the walls and walls of undifferentiated texts they are asked to climb. Dividing it into smaller, labelled chunks makes the text more approachable and more likely to be read.</p>



<p>This rich outlining can be done while planning your writing, during writing or during revision. I often don’t start with an outline because I’m not yet clear on exactly what I want to say. But I always create an outline at some point. It helps me discover all the missing and inconsistent bits that are so easy to miss in an extended narrative.</p>



<p>And, finally, if you have an outline, share it with the reader. Put it at the top of the text. It could be a table of contents or just a list of bullets. Better still, put it in the abstract. It is infuriating, reading an abstract that says what the paper tries to show and not what it actually showed. [4]</p>



<h2><span id="All_you_need">All you need</span></h2>



<p>And that’s it, clear explicit structure and moderately shorter sentences. No stories, no metaphors, no flourishes. No avoidance of passives or reduction of adverbs. No worries about technical language. Just these two. They will not only make the academic writing easier to read, they will also make it more scrupulous.</p>



<h2><span id="Self-criticism">Self-criticism</span></h2>



<p>Do I write as I say? Not always and not always perfectly. Some of my sentences do get long and my composition tends to the flowery. For example, the sentence about the importance of shorter sentences is the longest one of this post at 43 words. I thought about breaking it up but I liked its rhythm, so I left it. But my average sentence is 14 words and this makes the overall readability higher.</p>



<p>But that is the lot of anyone who writes about writing. The more strident your strictures, the more likely you are to <a href="https://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/168">fall afoul of them</a>.</p>



<h2><span id="Notes">Notes</span></h2>



<p><strong>[1]</strong> For those who do not routinely read books on writing. The title of the post refers to a book by Steven Pinker “The Sense of Style” which is a lot to wade through for not very much useful advice. The other book I complain about is Helen Sword’s “Stylish Academic Writing”, which overall has better and more actionable advice than Pinker. But the problem with Sword is that many of the examples she sets out to change actually don’t need changing that much. And the examples she singles out for praise are questionable.</p>



<p><strong>[2]</strong> The advice about how important it is pay attention about the language of the community you’re writing for is best summarised by Larry McEnerney in his talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM&amp;list=PLEl9d2qvKkBslX4kb0bG2mWmiSKYDGBdC&amp;index=3">Writing beyond the academy</a>.</p>



<p><strong>[3]</strong> The importance of thinking about your writing as communicating with interested peers is often made by Thomas Basbøll) on his <a href="https://blog.cbs.dk/inframethodology/">blog Inframethodology</a>. But it is also the core of the argument of this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25653028?seq=1">paper by Cathy Birkenstein defending Judith Butler</a> against the charge of incomprehensibility.</p>



<p><strong>[4]</strong> The <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a> also tries to identify passives and adverbs. Feel free to entirely ignore its advice. Also, it computes a readability score which is useful. But all it does is count letters in words and words in sentences. It is easy to game just by randomly inserting periods through out the text. ****</p>

This is a significant reduction when you consider the $16/kg price at the pump in California compared to our $4.57/kg being produced on demand. To show this, we used the measurements shown in the video above in the math shown below:<p>
1. In 48 seconds we produced 900 ml of hydrogen and oxygen gas, with two power supplies delivering 2.1V/54A and 2.3V/48A.
</p><p>
2. This results in 226.1W being used to produce 900 ml of gas (2.1V*54A+2.3V*49A = 226.1W).
</p><p>
3. In one hour, this would be approximately 69L of gas (48/3,600 = 0.013 of an hour. 1/0.013 = 76.9. 76.9*.9L = 69.21L).
</p><p>
4. If we use 1 kwh of power, we can make 300L of gas (1000KW/226.1W = 4.42. 4.42*69L = 304.98L)
</p><p>
5. In the 300L of gas, there are two moles of hydrogen for each mole of oxygen, so we have 198L of hydrogen gas (300L*0.66 = 198L).
</p><p>
6. The system was running at just under 40C. There will be 0.09kg of hydrogen per cubic meter. This means our 198L of hydrogen will weigh 0.016kg (198L/1000L= 0.198 cubic meters. 0.198m3*0.09kg = 0.0178kg).
</p><p>
7. To make a kilogram of hydrogen, we will need 34 kwh. At $0.105CDN per kwh of off peak power, our hydrogen will cost $5.82CDN/kg (1/0.018 = 55.5 kwh. 55.5kwh*10.5 cents = $5.82).
</p><p>
8. This is hydrogen produced on demand, with no storage or transportation. It can be made right at the pump. When compared to hydrogen at the pump in California, we produce hydrogen at $4.57USD kg versus the current $16USD/kg. 
</p><p>
This is using a Canadian made power supply that does not include any pulsing. We believe we can lower the power input an additional 25-50% by optimizing the system with our proprietary power supply.&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There were roughly 30 Street teams that participated in Korelogic’s <a href="https://contest-2020.korelogic.com/">2020 Crack Me If You Can</a> password cracking contest at Defcon. <a href="https://contest-2020.korelogic.com/graphs-street.html">I took 4th place</a>.</p><p>I think this was the 10th year that Korelogic has sponsored this contest at Defcon.</p><p>Some of the teams had two or three team members (some had more) and used multiple high end GPUs.

</code></pre></div><p>In total, it cost about $1,900 US dollars to build this computer and I typically use computers like this for five to seven years before building another.</p><h2 id="software">Software</h2><p>The software I used to crack the hashes is pretty standard.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a></li><li><a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/">Hashcat</a></li></ul><p>The only oddity is the password generation software that I wrote. It’s called Word Machine (wm) and I use it to create candidate passwords in a fashion similar to how humans create passwords. I pipe its output to john or hashcat.</p><p>Here’s a simple example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ echo -n word | wm -leet | wm -astring <span>2021</span> | wm -app <span>1</span> -chars sf
WORD2021.
WORD2021_
WORD2021!
WORD2021-
WORD2021?
WORD2021@
WORD2021*
...
</code></pre></div><p>Word machine does much more than this, but in general, that’s how it works.</p><p>I have implemented wm in C++ and in Go. The last several years, I’ve only been using the Go version as it performs better and the code is cleaner (Go was the second implementation).</p><p>I may publish the source code someday, but for now, it’s just a private hobby project.</p><h2 id="hash-types">Hash types</h2><p>The contest always has a variety of hashes. More points are awarded for cracking more difficult hash types. Here’s the list of the 2020 hash types:</p><ul><li>type=100 # sha1</li><li>type=111 # openssha (salted-sha1)</li><li>type=112 # oracle11</li><li>type=132 # mssql05</li><li>type=400 # phpass</li><li>type=1400 # raw-sha256</li><li>type=1700 # raw-sha512</li><li>type=1731 # mssql12</li><li>type=1800 # sha512crypt</li><li>type=3711 # mediawiki</li><li>type=7400 # sha256crypt</li><li>type=10900 # PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256</li><li>type=23100 # Apple keychain</li></ul><h2 id="my-approach">My approach</h2><p>I used word machine to generate common password patterns. Once I found a pattern for a certain user or type of hash, then I configured wm to focus on that particular pattern for awhile. Below are a few examples.</p><p>The sha512crypt hashes I cracked were largely made up of two words (<strong>fuck</strong> and <strong>shit</strong>) with common numeric appends and prepends. They were all eight characters long.</p><p>Once wm discovered that, I began focusing on just those two words and that specific pattern. I think I cracked about 1/3 of the sha512crypts on the first day of the contest. Because of this, I took the lead and held it for awhile.</p><p>There were a few variations of those words, too, such as <strong>35fucker</strong> and <strong>fuckYou3</strong>. Sorry for the vulgarity. I did not makeup the passwords. I just cracked them. I cracked many of these after the contest ended (see my pot files below).</p><p>sha512crypt is a hard, slow hash to attack and many teams didn’t bother trying. While simple cryptographic hashes, such as sha1, are much faster to attack, they were not worth many points.</p><p>A raw-sha1 crack earned only 1 point. A sha512crypt crack earned 800,000 points. I cracked 220 of them.</p><p>Word Machine discovered <strong>Dallas214</strong> in the sha256crypt hashes on the last day of the contest. Having more than a dozen hash types to attack and being a one man team (with only one inexpensive GPU) makes it difficult to discover and then spend time focusing on all the patterns in the various hash types. I wish I had discovered this pattern sooner. I cracked 88% of them, but only 53% were accepted due to some of the passwords being expired/changed on the second day of the contest (no credit for cracking them). Anyway, these were mostly cities with area codes appended.</p><p>The keychain hashes were capitalized passphrases such as <strong>Abidewithme</strong>, <strong>Whenpigsfly</strong>, and <strong>Sonofagun</strong>. word machine quickly discovered that pattern and I was able to focus on it early in the contest. I got a lot of points for these cracks, however, my version of Hashcat did not recognize the keychain hashes, so I had to pipe to John (which meant using the CPU) to crack these. That made this attack even slower.</p><p>For some reason, Hashcat did not recognize all the the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashes. There were 1,000 but Hashcat only saw 528. These hashes were really too difficult for John and my CPU to handle. I did uncover the pattern (after the contest had ended) and cracked most of them.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> The hash/digest portion of 472 of the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashes contained periods (which is an invalid base64 character). The salts were all valid. I wrote a small Go program to figure this out and correct it. I’m not sure if this was intentional or an accident. Either way, kudos to the teams who figured this out and cracked these during the contest. My failure to crack these (during the contest) is the main reason I was 4th instead of 3rd.</p><p>View my pot files (linked below) to see what other types of patterns wm found in other hash types.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The contest was fun. It always is. It’s a great way to learn more about hacking, cracking and encryption. I encourage everyone who likes to write code and fiddle with computers to try it next year. A big thanks to Hank and the Korelogic team for putting on the contest this year despite the pandemic.</p><h2 id="the-pot-files-and-hashes">The pot files and hashes</h2><p>Some of these hashes were cracked during the contest while others were cracked after it ended. I like to crack some of each type so that I understand the patterns that were used to create the passwords. I’ve lost a few cracks, too, since the contest ended.</p><p>The hash file contains the fixed PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashes and the originals (oracle11 too).</p><ul><li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/62726164/cmiyc2020/master/kl.jtr.pot.txt">kl.jtr.pot.txt</a></li><li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/62726164/cmiyc2020/master/kl.hc.pot.txt">kl.hc.pot.txt</a></li><li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/62726164/cmiyc2020/master/hashes.txt">hashes.txt</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/hacking">hacking</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

January 18, 2021 | https://www.gustin.blog/whyblog | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gustin.blog/whyblog">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, here it is.</p>
<p>A brand new personal (well, two persons) blog in the blogiverse.</p>
<p>And yes, it is currently the year 2020, which means it’s <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/history-of-blogging/#:~:text=The%20early%20history%20of%20blogging,thoughts%20on%20the%20content%20within.">23 years since blogging became a thing</a>.</p>
<p>It’s funny - I’ve always seen myself as someone wanting to be an early adopter in the latest trends or technologies, often finding myself sitting late at night looking at lists such as “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/video/10-breakthrough-technologies-of-2019-curated-by-bill-gates/">Bill Gates 10 Predictions for Breakthrough Technologies.</a>”</p>
<p>I mean, if you invest your time and money in one of these, surely you will be rewarded in the future when the majority catches on.</p>
<p>Which is why this feels a bit ironic, but I think starting a blog might be the smartest thing for me (and you) to do in 2020.</p>
<p>Here are three big reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a blog helps you develop a stronger personal brand (1+1=3)</li>
<li>It’s super scalable and very cheap (You have nothing to lose but time)</li>
<li>It can be a source of passive income (After a while)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Blogging builds a stronger personal brand</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“He is one of the tech-blogger-brothers… From Sweden I think? Don’t quote me on that”</p>
<p>- Unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, being famous most likely sucks and probably shouldn’t be anybody’s goal in life, however having a strong personal brand is just an extension of having a good reputation.</p>
<p>Us humans tend to place things into narratives, and having a cool blog gives the people around you information about their narrative of you. Having a strong personal brand also makes you more employable and might open doors that you didn’t know existed.</p>
<p><em>Let's paint a picture</em></p>
<p>Say you start a blog. You write a few posts (but nobody reads them) and feel pretty good.</p>
<p>One day, you see that there’s a cool tech conference in town. You send the people in charge a link to your cool-looking blog and promise to write a post about it if you can go. Leveraging your blogs (limited) reach and promising a blog post opens many doors to otherwise locked places.</p>
<p>You write the post, and suddenly you have some unique, quality content.</p>
<p>I, for example, used this blog to get interviews with two top angel investors in Sweden. Convincing them to grab a coffee with a broke 25-year old about investing millions of dollars wasn’t easy - But promising some blog coverage (+ plugging their sites) made all the difference.</p>
<p>One cold Thursday morning, a professor at the university you attended 8 years ago reaches out to you. He wants you to come and speak at his current course. He saw your blog on Facebook. You do it, get 200 dollars and plug your blog even more. Before you know it, you have a bit of a brand going on, meaning more opportunities everywhere you look.</p>
<p>Your blog shouldn’t be seen as an end product in itself, but as a powerful tool that you can leverage for many other things, creating viral loops.</p>
<p>1+1=3</p>
<h2>It’s super scalable (and very cheap)</h2>
<p>The internet has some crazy leverage. Two hours spent writing a blog post can potentially reach tens of millions of people instantly.</p>
<p>Starting a blog is also super cheap. The setup we run here is actually free - we are using Gatsby with Netlify to generate static sites (that can hold up to 100 million views per second). The only thing we pay for is the domain at 20 dollars a year.</p>
<p>Our setup does require some coding though, so if you aren’t at all into all that, I would recommend using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. It’s super easy for anyone to understand and get going with their blog. I would use Wix for this site if my brother wasn’t a tech wiz.</p>
<p>The blog being cheap isn’t why you should do it though.</p>
<p>You should do it because it’s scalable.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example: Logo Design</p>
<p>Creating logos for 5 dollars each on fiverr.com is not scalable. You need to spend a fixed amount at time and get a fixed amount back. Even if you up your price to 100 dollars per logo, there are only so many hours in a day for you to work.</p>
<p>Building a tool that generates a logo for the user based on their text input for a fee of 1 dollar is scalable. You spent a fixed amount of time but the potential upside is unlimited. 200,000 logos could be generated with your tool without you spending any more time than if 5 logos were generated.</p>
<p>Creating a personal blog is just like building a logo-generating tool.</p>
<p>I probably spent 3 hours writing this post. And the potential traffic could be 0, or it could be 200k. It’s all the same work for me.</p>
<p>This is also why scalable time investments are scary. You can spend 3 years writing a blog without any returns whatsoever. But with some common sense and knowledge, I think most people can figure it out:</p>
<p>Being a successful content creator is simply doing these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create quality content (writing/photographing/recording audio/filming)</li>
<li>Look at the data (Google Analytics)</li>
<li>Find your best performing piece (and check why it’s performing well)</li>
<li>Do more of that thing</li>
<li>Repeat consistently until successful</li>
</ol>
<h2>A source of passive income</h2>
<p>Blogging is something I do outside of my full-time job. But I do think I can grow it to be a substantial part of my yearly income.</p>
<p>If you write popular content, there are many legitimate ways of making some money off it.</p>
<p>If you write about the products you use, you could implement affiliate links to the products you recommend, thus getting a small kickback from the company you recommend. The key here is obviously to only recommend things you actually enjoy using and that readers can get value from.</p>
<p>Publishing a blog post about comparing two cameras could, with affiliate links, pay you monthly for the next 3-4 years without you having to put in any more time than that initial time investment.</p>
<p>It’s like putting a tiny snowball into motion and getting on with your life. And the more of these tiny snowballs you start, the bigger the passive income.</p>
<p>That cold beer you will buy one sunny day in June 2025, could be paid for by the three hours you spend tomorrow night writing your first blog post.</p>
<h2>Nobody will read your blog until everybody does (nobody really cares)</h2>
<p>One thing that held me back for a long time was the question: What will my friends and family think?</p>
<p>The truth is, nobody will read your blog until everybody does. Humans tend to think we are protagonists in the movie that is life. That’s true, but only for our own lives.</p>
<p>So, what will I write about? (And what should you write about?)</p>
<p>I will write about the same things I enjoy discussing with my closest friends. It could be investing, technology, lifestyle, psychology, or learning to be happy. I’m tackling these topics not as any kind of expert, but as a person trying to learn more. My writing style will be anecdotal, following my real life and progress on any of these topics and more.</p>
<p>I hope to see you around</p>
<p>Jacob</p></div></div>]]>

<p>This is a video abstract of our paper published in <em>Current Opinions in Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Obesity</em> in 2020:  <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/9000/Ketogenic_diet_as_a_metabolic_treatment_for_mental.99261.aspx">https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/9000/Ketogenic_diet_as_a_metabolic_treatment_for_mental.99261.aspx</a>. </p>



<p>Summary:  Psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder and binge eating disorder, are neurometabolic diseases that share several common mechanistic biopathologies. These include glucose hypometabolism, neurotransmitter imbalances,&nbsp;oxidative stress&nbsp;and&nbsp;inflammation. There is strong evidence that ketogenic diets can address these four fundamental diseases, and now complementary clinical evidence that ketogenic diets can improve the patients’ symptoms.</p>

        <p>“Never check secrets into source control” is one of those <em>rules</em> that are 100%
correct, until it’s not. There are no universal laws in software, and recently
I had a reason to break this one. I checked AWS keys into a Git repository. I
then pushed those commits to a <em>public</em> repository on GitHub. I did this
<strong>intentionally</strong>, and lived to tell the tale. You almost certainly should
never do this, so I thought I would share what happens when you do.</p>

<p>I can imagine you thinking: “this guy posted his AWS credentials on purpose? He
must be an idiot.” I don’t disagree with your conclusion, but just let me
explain!</p>

<p>My use-case is pretty simple: the
<a href="https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs">delta-rs</a> project needed a real S3
bucket to do some integration testing. I decided to set up a real S3 bucket for
our (read-only) integration tests. Fortunately our tests just needed to
retrieve objects from a bucket to confirm that an S3 bucket is presenting
itself as a Delta table properly. I would have <em>never</em> done this if we needed
“write” operations on the bucket.</p>

<h2 id="preparing">Preparing</h2>

<p>AWS has an integral access control framework called IAM, not to be confused
with an anagram of “AMI” which <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig">Corey Quinn</a> can
help you learn how to pronounce. IAM allows crafting policies and roles for
just about everything in AWS a dozen or more different ways. It slices, it
dices, it keeps your buckets safe. It is also configured with JSON, which is
awful, but I’ll have to save those rantings for another blog post. Anyways,
here’s the read-only policy that I set up for the bucket:</p>

<p>I also set up an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/">AWS
Budget</a> to alert me
should this start to ever cost real money. My currently monthly costs in this
AWS account are almost $1.50, so my budget is set such that if/when this
starts costing me more than a couple of dollars a month, AWS will email me so I
can figure out what to do in order to save my snapple money.</p>

<p>Finally, I created an IAM user for the integration tests. This IAM user has a
single IAM policy attached to it, listed out above. I then took the AWS access
key and secret key ID for the IAM user and checked those into Git.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2021-01-19 update:</strong> An anonymous reader points out:</p>

<p><em>Certain AWS APIs cannot be disabled via IAM, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html">including
<code>sts:GetCallerIdentify</code></a>
which in turn allows anyone with the public credentials to run the AWS
equivalent of <code>whoami</code>:</em></p>

<div><div><pre><code>% AWS_PROFILE=rtyler aws sts get-caller-identity

    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::547889645515:user/deltars-ro"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>AWS account numbers and IAM user ARNs are not especially privileged but be
aware that publishing access keys has a side effect of disclosing those too.</em></p>

<h2 id="boom-goes-the-dynamite">Boom goes the dynamite</h2>

<p>After preparing the integration tests, I pushed <a href="https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs/pull/63">my pull
request</a> at <strong>13:05 PST</strong>. When
pushing code to GitHub, anything that looks like an AWS access key is
immediately identified by robots around the world, most of them
malicious in intent, but a few designed to help developers like me who make silly mistakes.</p>

<p>At <strong>13:05:36 PST</strong>, an AWS Support Case was opened in my account:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear AWS customer,</p>

  <p>We have become aware that the AWS Access Key AKIAX7EGEQ7FT6CLQGWH, belonging to IAM User deltars-ro, along with the corresponding Secret Key is publicly available online at https://github.com/rtyler/delta.rs/blob/b3581ee06eee26d971bd3b76bb788c85ecf0c6c0/rust/tests/s3_test.rs .</p>

  <p>Your security is important to us and this exposure of your account’s IAM credentials poses a security risk to your AWS account, could lead to excessive charges from unauthorized activity, and violates the AWS Customer Agreement or other agreement with us governing your use of our Services.</p>

  <p>To protect your account from excessive charges and unauthorized activity, we have applied the “AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantine” AWS Managed Policy (“Quarantine Policy”) to the IAM User listed above. The Quarantine Policy applied to the User protects your account by limiting permissions for high risk AWS services.
You can view the policy by going here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCompromisedKeyQuarantine$jsonEditor?section=permissions .</p>

  <p>For your security, DO NOT remove the Quarantine Policy before following the instructions below. In cases where the Quarantine Policy is causing production issues you may detach the policy from the user. NOTE: Only users with admin privileges or with access to iam:DetachUserPolicy may remove the policy. For instructions on how to remove managed policies go here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html#remove-policies-console . In the event of the unauthorized use of your AWS account, we may, at our sole discretion, provide you with concessions. However, a failure to follow the instructions below may jeopardize your ability to receive a concession.</p>

  <p>If you believe you’ve received this note in error, please contact us immediately via the support case.</p>

  <p>PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO SECURE YOUR ACCOUNT:</p>

  <p>Step 1: Delete or rotate the exposed AWS Access Key AKIAX7EGEQ7FT6CLQGWH. To delete IAM User Keys go to your AWS Management Console here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users . To delete Root User Keys go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential .</p>

  <p>If your application uses the exposed Access Key, you need to replace the Key. To replace the Key, first create a second Key (at that point both Keys will be active) and then modify your application to use the new Key.
Then disable (but do not delete) the exposed Key by clicking on the “Make inactive” option in the console. If there are any problems with your application, you can reactivate the exposed Key. When your application is fully functional using the new Key, please delete the exposed Key.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Only rotating or deleting the exposed Key may not be sufficient to protect your account, see Step 2.</p>

  <p>Step 2: Check your CloudTrail log for unsanctioned activity such as the creation of unauthorized IAM users, policies, roles or temporary security credentials. To secure your account please delete any unauthorized IAM users, roles and policies, and revoke any temporary credentials.</p>

  <p>To delete unauthorized IAM User, navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users . To delete unauthorized policies go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies . To delete unauthorized roles go here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles  .</p>

  <p>Unauthorized temporary credentials may have been created for the IAM User deltars-ro with the exposed AWS Access Key AKIAX7EGEQ7FT6CLQGWH. You can revoke temporary credentials by following instructions outlined here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_disable-perms.html#denying-access-to-credentials-by-issue-time . Temporary credentials can also be revoked by deleting the IAM User. NOTE: Deleting IAM Users may impact production workloads and should be done with care.</p>

  <p>Step 3: Check your CloudTrail log to review your AWS account for any unauthorized AWS usage, such as unauthorized EC2 instances, Lambda functions or EC2 Spot bids. You can also check usage by logging into your AWS Management Console and reviewing each service page. The “Bills” page in the Billing console can also be checked for unexpected usage. https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bill</p>

  <p>Please keep in mind that unauthorized usage can occur in any region and that your console may show you only one region at a time. To switch between regions, you can use the dropdown in the top-right corner of the console screen.</p>

  <p>Please take steps to prevent any new credentials from being publicly exposed. See Best Practices of Managing your Access Keys at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html .</p>

  <p><span>Y</span>ou have a mind-shattering headache. You're standing in the aisle of your local CVS, massaging your temples while scanning the shelves for something—<em>anything</em>—to make make the pain stop.</p>

<p>What do you reach for? Tylenol? Advil? Aleve?</p>

<p>Most people, I imagine, grab whatever's cheapest, or closest, or whatever they <em>always</em> use. But if you're scrupulous enough to ask Google for the best painkiller, here's how your friendly neighborhood tech behemoth would answer:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBDQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--692ad5fb57e820714ca1dc70e3b05260aae65913/image-1601262407690.jpg" alt="Most effective painkillers"></p>

<p>Oh thanks Google that's just <em>all of them</em>.</p>

<p>If you're among the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/02/01/majority-of-adults-look-online-for-health-information/">77% of Americans</a> that Google their health problems, insipid answers like this won't surprise you. But we should be surprised, because researchers carry out <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e008932">tens of thousands</a> of clinical trials every year. And hundreds of clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of painkillers. So why can't I Google those results?</p>

<p>And so in the year of our lord 2017 I had a <strong>Brilliant Startup Idea</strong>: use a structured database of clinical trials to provide simple, practical answers to common medical questions.</p>

<p>As a proof-of-concept I tried this by hand: I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIx25J54JifJ8qliGnMBlKWn3PdB5sn852blOBfKfJk/">spreadsheet</a> with every OTC painkiller trial I could find and used <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to run a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386629/">network meta-analysis</a>, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-016-0715-4">gold standard</a> of evidence-based medicine.</p>

<p>The results were pretty interesting, and <em>exactly</em> the kind of thing I was looking for back in the sad sterile aisles of CVS:</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBEZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b560c1e2bdbe33d8ddd1f10436432d3658d62c1b/image-1601347817059.jpg" alt="Most effective painkillers"></p>

<p>A wave of exhiliration washed over me. Here was a problem that</p>

<ol>
<li>Was interesting</li>
<li>Could help people</li>
<li>I knew how to solve</li>
</ol>

<p>A perfect bullseye. After a few hours searching domains I came up with a name for my project: <strong>GlacierMD</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the next nine months I would quit my job, write over 200,000 lines of code, hire five contractors, create a Delaware C-Corp, add four doctors to my advisory board, and demo GlacierMD for twelve Bay Area medical practices. I would spend $40K of my own savings buying clinical trials and paying contractors to enter said trials into the GlacierMD database.</p>

<p>On July 2, 2018, GlacierMD powered the world's largest depression meta-analysis, using data from 846 trials, beating <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext">Cipriani's previous record</a> of 522.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBEdz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f65968deef4b6b7b836a90d2eee15119b5583f8c/image-1601347863747.jpg" alt="GlacierMD's evidence graph for depression treatments."></p>

<p>Choirs of angels sang in my ears. Here I was, living the Silicon Valley dream: making the world a better place through technology.</p>

<p>Two weeks later GlacierMD was dead.</p>

<hr>

<div><p><span>"T</span>hat's an awesome idea," said Carl. "It sounds like something worth working on."
</p><p>
Carl was my boss. We worked at a startup that leveraged autonomous blockchains to transfer money from naïve investors to slightly less naïve twenty-somethings. There are worse gigs.</p></div>

<p>And here was Carl telling me that my startup idea would bring such benefit to humanity that I simply <em>had</em> to quit, his roadmap be damned. I nodded knowingly, feeling the weight of this responsibility resting on my proud shoulders.</p>

<p>"Thanks Carl," I said. "I'll try to mention you when I accept my Nobel."</p>

<p>I quit two weeks later and started coding at a blistering pace. I drew all sorts of inscrutable diagrams with dry-erase pens on my parents' windows. I hired a motley crew of Egyptian contractors to start entering clinical trials into my database. I commissioned a logo, registered my domain, and started obsessing over color schemes.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBFQT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--da9ab4b5da5f08cc26afe10e0531b89321ff5a24/image-1601347898563.jpg" alt="Data extraction portal for GlacierMD"></p>

<p>When I finally finished the MVP I showed it to the head of product at the company I'd just left. I watched him as he watched my demo, waiting for his eyes to melt with the glory of it all. Instead he just sorta shrugged.</p>

<p>"Lots of people make medical claims on the internet," he said. "Why should I trust yours?"</p>

<p>I started babbling about network meta-analyses, statistical power, and p-values, but he cut me off.</p>

<p>"Yeah okay that's great but nobody cares about this math crap. You need doctors."</p>

<p>Goddamnit he was right. If nobody could be bothered with the math, then I was no better than Gwyneth Paltrow hawking <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45426332">vagina eggs</a>. To build trust I needed to get endorsements from trustworthy people.</p>

<p>So I called up some friends, some buddies, some friends-of-friends. "Would you like to be an advisor for my cutting-edge health-tech startup?" I'd ask, while eating Dominos in my parents' laundry room. I'd give them 1% of this extermely valuable, high-growth startup and in exchange I could plaster their faces all over my website.</p>

<p>Four of these doctors agreed. This is called <em>making deals</em> ladies and gentlemen and I was like the lovechild of Warren Buffet and Dr. Oz.</p>

<p>Things are going great. My friends and family all tell me they love the site. Even some strangers on the internet love it. "I know right," I tell them. "So how much would you pay for this?"</p>

<p>"Hahahahahahah," they say in unison. "Good one!"</p>

<p>I forgot that the the first law of consumer tech is <em>nobody pays for consumer tech</em>. But no problemo, I say to myself. This is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> invented ads. I'll just plaster a few banners on GlacierMD and <em>bing bang boom</em> I'll be <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/">seasteading</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiel</a> before <a href="https://burningman.org/">Burning Man</a>.</p>

<p>But then I look at WebMD's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326583/000119312517247147/d391943d10q.htm">10-Qs</a> and start to spiral. Turns out the world's biggest health website makes about $0.50/year <em>per user</em>. That is...not enough money to bootstrap GlacierMD. I'm pouring money into my rent, into my Egyptian contractors, into AWS—I need some cash soon.</p>

<p>What I need are people willing to pay for this thing. What about doctors? Doctors have money, right? Maybe doctors, or practices, or whatever—someone in the medical industry—maybe they would shell out some cash for my on-demand meta-analyses.</p>

<p>So I listened to a few podcasts and became a sales expert. I started cold calling people using scripts from the internet and tried to convince them to sit through a GlacierMD demo.</p>

<p>In the meantime I receive some worrying messages from my Egyptian contractors.</p>

<p>"I think it's time to talk about a raise," one of them says.</p>

<p>"I feel that I have become exceptional at my job," says another. "Please consider a raise or I will stop working."</p>

<p>"Please increase my pay," says the third, including helpful screenshots demonstrating how to give said raise through the Upwork website.</p>

<p><em>Are my contractors unionizing?</em> I wonder. I glance obliquely at my shrinking bank account statement, grit my teeth, and approve the raises. At this rate I'll hit zero in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>But my sales calls start paying off. Miraculously I find some doctors that are willing to talk to me. So I borrow my parents' car and drive out to the burbs to meet a doctor I'll call Susan.</p>

<p>Susan has a small practice in downtown Redwood City, a Silicon Valley town that looks 3-D printed from the Google Image results for <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=main+street&amp;tbm=isch">main street</a></em>.</p>

<p>Susan is a bit chatty (she's a psychiatrist) but eventually I demo GlacierMD. I show her how you can filter studies based on the demographic data of the patient, how you can get treatment recommendations based on a preferred side effect profile, how you can generate a dose-response curve. She <em>oohs</em> and <em>aahs</em> at all the right points. By the end of the interview she's practically drooling.</p>

<p><img src="https://cringle.io/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBFUT09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--927e2748d8adb987b5d491746fcbb3691f186d1b/image-1601347948152.jpg" alt="Comparing the efficacy of two antidepressants over time"></p>

<p><em>Hook, line, and sinker</em> I think to myself. I'm already contemplating what color <a href="https://www.awaytravel.com/">Away bags</a> would look best in the back of my <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Cybertruck</a> when Susan interrupts my train of thought.</p>

<p>"What a fun project!" she says enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Something in her tone makes me pause. "Uh, yeah," I say. "So what would you imagine a product like this—one that could change the very <em>practice</em> of medicine—how much would you pay for such a service?"</p>

<p>"Oh, uh—hmmmm," she said. "I don't know if we can spare the budget here, to be honest. It's very fun...but I'm not sure if our practice can justify this cost."</p>

<p>If you read enough sales books most of them tell you that when people say your product is <em>too expensive</em> what they really mean is your product <em>isn't valuable enough</em>. Susan acted like I was offering her Nirvana as a Service so the conversation has taken quite a wild turn.</p>

<p>"So you don't think this product is useful?"</p>

<p>"Oh sure! I mean, I think in many cases I'll just prescribe what I normally do, since I'm comfortable with it. But you know it's possible that sometimes I'll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies."</p>

<p>"And that isn't worth something? Prescribing better treatments?"</p>

<p>"Hmmmm," she said, picking at her fingernails. "Not directly. Of course I always have the best interests of my patients in mind, but, you know, it's not like they'll pay more if I prescribe Lexapro instead of Zoloft. They won't come back more often or refer more friends. So I'd sorta just be, like, <em>donating</em> this money if I paid you for this thing, right?"</p>

<p>I had literally nothing to say to that. It had been a bit of a working assumption of mine over the past few weeks that if you could improve the health of the patients then, you know, the doctors or the hospitals or whatever would pay for that. There was this giant thing called <em>healthcare</em> right, and its main purpose is <em>improving health</em>—trillions of dollars are spent trying to do this. So if I built a thing that improves health someone should pay me, right?</p>

<p>I said goodbye to Susan and tried to cheer myself up. I had ten more meetings with doctors all over the Bay Area—surely not all of them were ruthless capitalists like Susan. Maybe they would see the the towering genius of GlacierMD and shell out some cash.</p>

<p>But in fact everyone gave me some version of Susan's answer. "We just can't justify the cost," a pediatrician told me. "I'm not sure it's in the budget," said a primary care physician. "It's awesome," said a hospitalist. "You should try to sell this!" <em>Ugh</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><span>S</span>o in July 2018, nine months and $40K after starting GlacierMD, I shut it down. I fired my contractors, archived the database, and shut down the servers. GlacierMD was dead.</p>

<p><em>Make something people want</em>. It's Y-Combinator's motto and a maxim of aspiring internet entrepreneurs. The idea is that if you build something truly awesome, you'll figure out a way to make some money off of it.</p>

<p>So I built something people wanted. Consumers wanted it, doctors wanted it, <em>I</em> wanted it. Where did I go wrong?</p>

<p>Occassionally I like to disconnect from the IV drip of internet …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><blockquote><p>This is an in-depth review of how Synyx GmbH &amp; Co building is using Turing Pi board in combination with GitLab CI and Ansible for their CI/CD needs</p><cite>Author: Karl-Ludwig Reinhard</cite></blockquote></figure><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In my previous&nbsp;article,&nbsp;I explained some cloudy statements about Ansible and Gitlab CI and that we’re going to work with a Turing Pi for that purpose. I already talked about the capabilities of this amazing board and the first steps it takes to get it up and running. Today I’ll go a little bit into details on what benefits we are having when running Ansible scripts in a CI environment and most important where the Turing Pi helps us.</p><h3>What we’re going to build with it?</h3><p>In our project, we have a lot of Raspis and configure them all with Ansible. From time to time we are adding new features and fixing bugs in our Ansible scripts and that makes them more complex. We are using GitLab to review our code, but what is missing is a validation of the syntax and that the code will actually work on production’s hardware. Considering that our team continues to grow, this adds more complexity. So we put 4 Raspberry Pis into a rack and integrated them as a deploy target for our merge requests.</p><h4>When a user opens a merge request, we reboot the machine and run the OS via the network. With that, we can flash the SD card with a fresh Raspbian. After a reboot, we can start our Ansible scripts to test if the merge request is sane.</h4><figure><img src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" alt="" data-src="https://synyx.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rack2-768x534.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><p>With just running an Ansible Playbook for setting up hosts from 0 to 100 we get the following benefits:</p><ol><li>Check if the syntax is correct</li><li>Ensure that all needed files are committed</li><li>Can different configuration flavors still be applied?</li></ol><h2>Why do we need netboot at all?</h2><p>Our goal is to run our Ansible script against a freshly installed Raspbian. We cannot be sure, that the last tested merge request was flawless. The idea is to reboot the node into an NFS based root file system. From there we can flash a Raspbian and reboot into a clean OS. After that, we can apply &amp; test our Ansible scripts. Following this process guarantees, that every merge request gets a clean system without any leftovers from a previous run.</p><h2>Setting up Gitlab CI/runner</h2><p>To be honest&nbsp; – we’re currently stuck with a shell runner. We weren’t able to find a proper working docker image with ansible that doesn’t lack some tooling/libs that are currently required. Building a custom docker image would be possible but for the sake of simplicity, we use a simple shell runner.</p><p>First of all, we need to set up one node as a DHCP/TFTP boot server. Here is a good <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tutorial</a> on how to do this. We recommend to run one of the Turing Pi nodes as a DHCP/TFTP boot server – it’s more reliable than a server placed outside of the board.</p><p>One thing to note: The DHCP server is located behind a NAT router so it does not interfere with DHCP servers in our company network.</p><p>When the server is up and running, we need to set up the Gitlab runner.</p><ol><li>Due to the fact we rely on a shell runner Ansible has to be installed by hand. This can be done with your package manger. Also, install all dependencies that are needed for a successful Ansible run.</li><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Install</a> GitLab CI runner. When asked which kind of runner, choose shell runner.</li><li>Add a custom inventory.<br>You can use your regular inventory and add there your ci host. Then you have to limit your Ansible run with <code><mark>–limit</mark></code> option. If omitted you’ll most probably deploy your prod system with every merge request 🙂</li><li>Add or change <code><mark>.gitlab-ci.yml</mark></code> accordingly:</li></ol><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">stages:
  - test-on-pis
  
test-on-turing-pi:
  stage: test-on-pis 
  script:
    - export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
    - mkdir $HOME/.ssh || true 
    - echo -e "Host 192.168.2.*\nStrictHostKeyChecking no\nUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" &gt; $HOME/.ssh/config
    - ansible-playbook reflash.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5"
    - ansible-playbook initial.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=raspberry"
    - ansible-playbook site.yml -i hostsCI.yml -e "ansible_ssh_pass=Bai9iZaetheeSee5" -e "http_proxy="
  except:
    - master</pre><p>We do some „dirty“ SSH tricks at the beginning. This ensures that Ansible can connect to the systems even when the host keys have changed. That will happen with our setup after we reflashed the system. We tried to do this during an ansible run but weren’t successful.</p><p>Reflashing your Pi is really straightforward when the PXE server is setup. Let’s have a look at some excerpt:</p><pre data-enlighter-language="yaml" data-enlighter-theme="atomic" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--

  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"

  when: root_mnt.stdout_lines[0] != "nfs"

  connection: local</pre><ul><li>• First of all, we check if the current system is already running on an NFS root filesystem. If so we can skip the next two steps. If not we destroy the current boot partition – just write some rubbish on the raw device.</li><li>• Next, we reboot the system.</li><li>• Then we flash the sd card/eMMC with the help of Zcat. We compress our images to save some HD space and be able to transfer them via a wan connection(if needed). The performance impact is negligible. One reboot later and that’s it. We have a freshly installed Raspbian and can apply our Ansible scripts to a fresh system.</li></ul><h3>Two things to note:</h3><ul><li>• We ignore errors when flashing. When the image is missing or similar, we just continue and reboot the system. In most cases, the system will be still accessible</li><li>• I couldn’t get the reboot module working properly. I think the newly flashed system does not have the same remote user and password as when we started the role. With this ugly part, it’s working 🙂</li></ul><p>Be aware that the above script is an excerpt from the main.yml of the corresponding role and is not complete!</p><h3>What we also do</h3><p>After a successful run, we apply some smoke tests. One flavor of our RPis is kiosk systems that start X11 and opens a chromium browser in fullscreen mode. With some „technical creativity“(aka mocking) we ensure that the browser is running. When this is not going to happen, the build fails. Another flavor is used for controlling an industrial actor and its basic functionality is also tested at the end. We do not test every aspect, it’s more of a kind of smoke tests or checks if certain TCP ports are open.</p><p>What we also want to know how our Ansible scripts affect a running system that is not flattened or rebooted on every run. We deploy two node continuously when a merge to master happens. With that, we can also monitor the memory usage on these systems and can identify possible memory leaks or stability issues when running a system longer time. It has served us well as an additional safety net.</p><h2>Why the Turing Pi is ideal for us</h2><p>Compared to our old setup we gained speed and stability of our builds. In the past, we had problems when booting multiple pis in parallel from the network. PIs were stuck in the boot process and didn’t get their kernel via TFTP or couldn’t mount the NFS root reliably. To this day, I’m not sure where I went wrong – I fixed it by throttling the reboots so that the Pis are booted one by one. That slowed down the „build“ significantly.</p><h4>With the Turing Pi we did not encounter any problems booting pis in parallel from the network at the same time. So after testing it a bit I removed the throttle and reduced the build time significantly</h4><p>Another thing we see a lot less stuck Ansible jobs because the network connection is flaky. I got the impression, that working with the network on the PCB is a lot more reliant. We use Turing Pi for two weeks as a replacement for our old „test cluster“ – can’t remember that I had to reset the cluster manually caused by a frozen job.</p><p>Currently, we work most of the time from home –&nbsp; Covid19 case numbers are rising in Germany and it looks like we’ll stay at home for some time. With some VPN and network magic, we can use some nodes as test devices from the remote. In the past, everybody got his „personal“ test pi, had to ensure proper network connection, flash the sd card manually, etc. Yes, you can use Raspbian X86 but some things like accessing Bluetooth or GPIOs cannot properly be tested in a virtual environment.</p><h2>What we’ve learned as a team?</h2><p>In our last review and retro, we talked also about our CI setup. We’ve agreed, that it helps us a lot in our day-to-day business and adds to the quality of our merge requests. For me personally, it is a very good incentive to use more merge requests so the CI pipeline is triggered and I am forced to work more in a clean way. But it takes time to set it up, stabilize some (ugly) parts – but after all the time investment is worth it. Additional tests and reviews improve the quality even in the context of configuring an OS and reduces the number of errors.</p><h2>What we miss with Turing Pi</h2><p>Not much to be honest. Two things would be really awesome:</p><ol><li>Switching the HDMI output from the first node to a different node via i2c</li><li>For flashing EMMc the first slot only can be used. It would be great if you could also use the other slots for flashing as well.</li></ol><p>I think achieving these two points isn’t easy and for us not really pain points 🙂</p><h2>Where we (maybe) want to go</h2><p>Currently, we are deploying our prod systems still from our workstations. Continuos delivery will be a topic for us. But something like „merge on master“ and deploy the prod system instantly is too risky for us. Our Pis are an integral part of our customers. And that’s not the definition for CD(for me :)). Our pis are not easily …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>There are more and more websites / apps / softwares using Darkmode, and it has become a huge design trend over the past years, e.g. see here: <a href="https://mobiteam.medium.com/what-is-dark-mode-and-why-is-it-a-web-design-trend-in-2020-c638b6f22e17">https://mobiteam.medium.com/what-is-dark-mode-and-why-is-it-a-web-design-trend-in-2020-c638b6f22e17</a></p>
<p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>“Dark Mode” needs to be implemented on the hardware side, not the software side.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the idea is to minimize brightness to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save energy</li>
<li>Reduce Eye Strain</li>
<li>Reduce blue light emission</li>
<li>Improve sleep quality</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is lots of research suggesting, that Dark Mode is more of a placebo <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/dark-mode-chrome-android-ios-science">than it actually works</a>. There is already a set of new display technologies being developed that have the benefits of “Dark Mode” without the need of extra software, namley E-Paper technology and RLCD. Those are having several advantages over “old” Display technologies:</p>

<p>Dark mode, blue light blocking glasses, etc. are just part of a bigger trend nameley the shrinking backlight industry in the display industry.</p>
<p>There are some intersting players developing backlight free screens already and in 5-10 years it will be the standard. Also in terms of screen economics, not even mentioning the material and energy savings.</p>
<p>The thing is, that our body/eye has been trained for thousands of years to work with reflective light (to see things/objects through the light reflection of the sun). The screen trend to look directly into backlight over the past decades is very unnatural to our body/vision and <a href="http://www.bluelightexposed.com/#bluelightexposed">caused many problems</a>. We need a screen technology that is very aligned with on how our body is designed and works.</p>
<p>Big players in the display market are realizing this and building alternatives. Big players include Sharp, Lenovo, BOE Technologies, JDI, Flex Lightning, Hisense, ONYX, Dasung etc.</p>
<p>You can read about screen alternatives (like eink and rlcd) here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/h179j5/new_eink_alternative_flexs_optional_front_light/">https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/h179j5/new_eink_alter…</a></p>
<p>PS: There was recently aready a Tablet released with the new RLCD screen technolgoy by BOE-Technologies, check here: <a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/06/11/tablet-with-high-refresh-rate.html">https://boingboing.net/2020/06/11/tablet-with-high-refresh-r…</a></p>

<h2 id="Intro">Intro<a href="#Intro">¶</a></h2><p>In my previous blog post, I discussed how to use Cython to get a more than hundredfold speed improvement on training an adaptive equaliser for optical communications experiments and simulations. The downside to that gain was that the optimised Cython-code was quite unwieldy and contained a lot of boilerplate. Something I was trying to avoid by using Python. Thus making the code much easier to use and adjust for our&nbsp;students.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will investigate several other methods of speeding up numerical Python code and benchmark them against each other. The benchmarks can be found at <a href="https://gitlab.com/Jochen/benchmarknotebooks">this</a> gitlab&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>The methods we are looking at&nbsp;are:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a></strong>
The Numpy module provides an array class together with a lot of numerical functions. It is at the core of almost every numerical and scientific package for Python. Here it is going to be our baseline&nbsp;performance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a></strong> 
Cython is a superset of the Python language which can be compiled to C-code. Ideally, if one eliminates most accesses to Python objects it can achieve almost the same speed as C. However, the more you optimize Cython the more it will look like C and less like Python. We showed in our previous post that it achieves an almost 200-fold performance increase on my system over the numpy&nbsp;version.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a></strong>
Numba is a <span>JIT</span> compiler for a subset of Python and numpy which allows you to compile your code with very minimal changes. In theory it can achieve performance on par with Fortran or C. It can automatically optimize for <span>SIMD</span> instructions and adapts to your system. While numba also allows you to compile for GPUs I have not included that&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran">Pythran</a></strong> 
Pythran is a bit the new kid on the block. It’s an ahead of time compiler for numerical and scientific python that can take advantage of <span>SIMD</span> instructions and OpenMP directives to speed up your code. It allows compiling to C++ and doesn’t need a python interpreter so can be used for prototyping code for e.g. embedded devices. Note that recently it has become possible to use Pythran to compile numpy code within&nbsp;Cython.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a></strong>
Is not a way of speeding up Python code, but instead a different programming language. It was developed with the aim of being a replacement for matlab and has seen a lot of attention lately as it is a dynamic language with familiar syntax for people who know matlab or python with very high performance. I’ve included it here to see how it compares to the other&nbsp;options.</p>
<h3 id="Note-on-optimizations">Note on optimizations<a href="#Note-on-optimizations">¶</a></h3><p>I have not spend the same amount of time as I did for optimizing the cython code on the other methods. I believe that it is generally still a fair comparison, because the all other methods promote that they essentially achieve the speed-gains with very little additional effort. However, if you see that I missed a significant optimisation please create a pull-request to the repostory and I will update the&nbsp;code.</p>
<h2 id="Benchmark">Benchmark<a href="#Benchmark">¶</a></h2><p>We are using the training of an adaptive equaliser as our benchmark program. This is a very common function for modern optical communications systems and we generally want it to be as fast as possible when processing our experimental data. You can find a more detailed discussion on my previous blogpost. Importantly we will be using QAMpy a processing and simulation chain for optical communications, you can find it on github <a href="https://github.com/ChalmersPhotonicsLab/QAMpy">here</a></p>

<h3 id="Simulation">Simulation<a href="#Simulation">¶</a></h3><p>We are going to set up the simulation enviroment using QAMpy first. As previously we are simply simulating a channel with additive White Gaussion Noise (<span>AWGN</span>) and a root-raised cosine pulse-shaping filter. So our adaptive equaliser is only performing matched filtering. However that should not have any influence on the simulation&nbsp;performance.</p>

<div><p>As in my previous post, numpy took about 5.5 s for processing the 100,000 symbols, on my Ryzen 3600 system. We can also see that the adaptive filter improved performance by a factor of 10. 
Generally 100,000 symbols is on the lower end of what we measure and 5 s is quite a wait so we really want to go faster than&nbsp;this.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's now roughly seven or eight years that I'm building dynamic front ends for the web. From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital art wallets</a> to games (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I've seen it all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today, I'd like to share how I'm developing web apps in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-build-processes.">I avoid build processes.</h2>
<p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago. Within the front end development world, transpiling had just become a thing, so we ended up babelifying our builds to use ES6. Our argument back then was that one day, we would be able to push our application's directory structure on a web server and since all browsers would then support the augmented ES6 features, our app would just work! Without a build process. WOW! That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of these old applications now, our technical visions didn't end up becoming reality.</p>
<p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need to write a demo app, I particularly like using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;</code></a>. I love <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact's "no build tools route."</a> too. When I have to set up an actual app, I avoid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. I mainly get frustrated about the myriad ways of configuring them. Some minor thing always ends up being broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreign code. And that's frustrating. Using preact's no build route, finally something like the above is possible:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>import</span> { h, Component, render } <span>from</span> <span>'https://unpkg.com/preact?module'</span>;</span><br><span>  <span>const</span> app = h(<span>'h1'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello World!'</span>);</span><br><span>  render(app, <span>document</span>.body);</span><br><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as they come preconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it's merely using an HTML file as its entry point. To me, that's promising as it assumes a proper directory structure and properly connected files such that maybe one day I can push my app to the web without that build step.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-transpiling.">I avoid transpiling.</h2>
<p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoid transpiling. It's not because I don't like ESNext features, but more because I want to minimize the risk of getting stuck with the transpiler. Hence, I try to avoid using babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don't use Typescript</a>. To me, JavaScript is productive enough. Additionally, for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, no transpilers mean I stopped using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. Instead, I found an excellent library called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that uses JavaScript's template strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it's not breaking ECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-the-new-and-shiny.">I avoid the <em>new</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</h2>
<p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don't feel comfortable or inclined. For example, I never switched to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">react hooks</a>. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecycle methods</a> that I initially know from iOS Objective-C programming are - in my opinion - a beautiful metaphor for writing front end components. And neither did I have any issues with my sites' performance. I would make the switch if I started to have problems. But I don't. The same goes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a framework when I'm already productive with the one I use?</p>
<h2 id="i-test-everything.">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2>
<p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only a few front end developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I ended up doing a lot of testing by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive. But testing front ends has improved dramatically over the years. Not only have the tools been significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how to correctly write front end tests. Finally, we're able to distinguish between functional code and presentational code. For functional code, we now write unit tests. For presentational code, we use snapshot-based testing and integration tests. I'm pleased about tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great for integration tests. I also like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> for unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="i-optimize-for-performance-and-quality.">I optimize for performance and quality.</h2>
<p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software: the more features, the better. I'm not anymore. Instead, I try to develop software that works well for my users. I strive for quality. So I try to measure my build's size. I take proper care about delivering my application, meaning I turn on compression and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>. I care about optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like to check my apps by using tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeed Insights</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2>
<p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on a algorithmic problem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn something new and excel in the process. However, I caught my self often spending many hours on debugging other people's code. Mainly when it's third-party libraries that I included via npm. Once, I thought that using npm packages was a JavaScript developer's superpower. Now, I know that it can also be their curse.</p>
<p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now prefer following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">Peter Hintjens' principles for writing good code</a>. I "use my own work." Meaning, I dare to write seemingly complex code myself. I still won't roll my own crypto or write a date library, but I dare to implement parts of a protocol or build an algorithm. It's not to say that I ditch every npm package and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindful approach towards dependencies and only include them when I truly need them.</p>
<p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of my office, so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I try to stop worrying about eventualities far in the future as I view that as speculation. In cases I have past experiences, I use it to form my decision. For unchartered teritory, I move carefully, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-open-source-to-my-advantage.">I use open source to my advantage.</h2>
<p>I'm building websites since I'm a teenager. And had I open-sourced and maintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I'd be more productive now. Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, I didn't think about still using JavaScript at 29 years of age 😂</p>
<p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like free speech, fairness or certain politics. They're still important virtues for me, but I learned that I could use open source also for building a personal toolset.</p>
<p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it from a user's perspective. It means I'm able to think about a piece of code's interfaces emphatically. Additionally, there's positive peer pressure. I'm not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public, it's going to have a proper README and some docs. And it's going to be tested. Since everybody can see it, I might as well create something I can be proud of.</p>
<p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about building high-quality software. Being anxious about not being able to monetize this particular piece of code has become less of a concern. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me to treat open source packages like my personal toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's my incomplete list of principles. I'm sure there's more than just these. Anyway, I still find some of these points quite controversial. I'm sure they won't work for everyone as all our contexts differ. But working solo as a freelancer, I've found that these principles contribute to me being content about what I'm doing. Hence, I was eager to share them.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear other's thoughts and see if they've taken similar paths. Please reach out! Also, don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter!</p>

          <p>Hey fellow E-Ink enthusiats,</p>
<p>many of you might have heard form the recent Clubhouse buzz. It’s a audio-only social network and got quite a lot of attention in the past months:</p>


<p>I have tried it today for the first time and I’m blown away by the awesome user experience. So how is this related to eink? Well, especially in COVID times we are having more and more screen time and new issues like <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychological-exploration-zoom-fatigue">zoom Fatigue</a> and the like appear. E-ink is (at least partially) about improving the screen ergonomics and healthier display tech for eye strain reduction and eye comfort.</p>
<p>But why not bring this to a new level and have more “audio-only” applications. I could see more work flows being without display. The classical example is a phone call, but it’s more and more coming with WhatsApp audio messages, voice to speek recogntion and the like.</p>
<p>What is the next Clubhouse for X?</p>


<p>Can you imagine having more screen workflows being “screenless”. I think it’s even more natural to use voice and audio than just typing into a screen. Or even better to combine voice, audio and eink. What would be the best ergonomic working station? Eventually even use AI to optimize further?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <p>A <em><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.census.gov%2F2011%2F07%2F20%2Fwhat-are-census-blocks%2F&amp;t=ZDk3YjI4YjkzYWMzN2M4ODcyNzZmMjRiNDA5NGRkNmU1MzQ0Y2JkYix4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611262618">Block</a></em> is the smallest area unit used by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating statistics. As of the 2010 census, the United States consists of 11,078,300 Census Blocks. Of them, 4,871,270 blocks totaling 4.61 million square kilometers were reported to have no population living inside them. Despite having a population of more than 310 million people, 47 percent of the USA remains unoccupied.</p><p>Green shading indicates unoccupied Census Blocks. A single inhabitant is enough to omit a block from shading.</p><p><strong>Update Jan 2015</strong>: <a href="http://tumblr.mapsbynik.com/post/107762841792/nobody-lives-here-map-prints-available">Prints and canvas of the Nobody Live Here map</a> are now available.</p><p><em>Update 2014.05.01</em>: I’ve received a couple questions about Canada.  Just to be clear, this map is of the United States only. It is based on 2010 data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, which for reasons I hope are apparent, does not include data on our friends in the Great White North. For a similar depiction of Canada, see <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSrefoUG.jpg&amp;t=OGIyYmM2NzUxMDViZjU3YWVjNzQzMDMzNTk1Njg4Nzk2YWNhMGI4NCx4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611262618">this map</a> whipped up by Michael Chung.</p><h2>Map observations</h2><p>The map tends to highlight two types of areas:</p><ul><li>places where human habitation is physically restrictive or impossible, and</li><li>places where human habitation is prohibited by social or legal convention.</li></ul><p>Water features such lakes, rivers, swamps and floodplains are revealed as places where it is hard for people to live. In addition, the mountains and deserts of the West, with their hostility to human survival, remain largely void of permanent population.</p><p>Of the places where settlement is prohibited, the most apparent are wilderness protection and recreational areas (such as national and state parks) and military bases. At the national and regional scales, these places appear as large green tracts surrounded by otherwise populated countryside.</p><p>At the local level, city and county parks emerge in contrast to their developed urban and suburban surroundings. At this scale, even major roads such as highways and interstates stretch like ribbons across the landscape.</p><p>Commercial and industrial areas are also likely to be green on this map. The local shopping mall, an office park, a warehouse district or a factory may have their own Census Blocks. But if people don’t live there, they will be considered “uninhabited”. So it should be noted that just because a block is unoccupied, that does not mean it is undeveloped.</p><p>Perhaps the two most notable anomalies on the map occur in Maine and the Dakotas. Northern Maine is conspicuously uninhabited. Despite being one of the earliest regions in North America to be settled by Europeans, the population there remains so low that large portions of the state’s interior have yet to be politically organized.</p><p>In the Dakotas, the border between North and South appears to be unexpectedly stark. Geographic phenomena typically do not respect artificial human boundaries. Throughout the rest of the map, state lines are often difficult to distinguish. But in the Dakotas, northern South Dakota is quite distinct from southern North Dakota. This is especially surprising considering that the county-level population density on both sides of the border is about the same at less than 10 people per square mile.</p><p><em>Update</em>: On a more detailed examination of those two states, I’m convinced the contrast here is due to differences in the sizes of the blocks. North Dakota’s blocks are more consistently small (StDev of 3.3) while South Dakota’s are more varied in area (StDev of 9.28). West of the Missouri River, South Dakota’s blocks are substantially larger than those in ND, so a single inhabitant can appear to take up more space. Between the states, this provides a good lesson in how changing the size and shape of a geographic unit can alter perceptions of the landscape.</p><p>Finally, the differences between the eastern and western halves of the contiguous 48 states are particularly stark to me. In the east, with its larger population, unpopulated places are more likely to stand out on the map. In the west, the opposite is true. There, population centers stand out against the wilderness.</p><h2>::</h2><p>Ultimately, I made this map to show a different side of the United States. Human geographers spend so much time thinking about where people are. I thought I might bring some new insight by showing where they are not, adding contrast and context to the typical displays of the country’s population geography.</p><p>I’ve all but scratched the surface of insight available from examining this map. There’s a lot of data here. What trends and patterns do you see?</p><h2>Errata</h2><ul><li>Due to a cartographic mishap, the Gulf of California was missing from the original version. Though it was quickly fixed, that version keeps popping up across the Internet. It displeases me I see it, yet I’m amused that people keep reposting it without noticing the error. The geography gods judge those people harshly.</li><li>Some islands may be missing on the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmapsbynik.com%2Fmaps%2Fcensus0pop%2F&amp;t=NGE5ZGEyN2NjZjVhNjVkY2JlMWIyMjU3MTczZjJlYWY1OTI0OTRhZSx4ZmVCRFVSUQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A08IjTEwOylSib4KWGzwNdw&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.mapsbynik.com%2Fpost%2F82791188950%2Fnobody-lives-here-the-4-million-census-blocks&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1611262618">hi-res edition</a> if they were not a part of the waterbody data sets I used.</li></ul><h3>::</h3><p>©mapsbynik 2014<br>

<p>Have you felt like this on a tech team? </p>



<p>Getting out of tech debt can feel like a Sisyphean task. It’s not uncommon for organizations to declare code bankruptcy and rewrite <em>working systems</em> from the ground up. As a former enterprise software consultant, I have participated in some of these rewrites. They cost half a million dollars almost automatically. They can cost millions easily.</p>



<p>Something that pricey and frustrating deserves analysis: how do we end up in this situation? How do we measure it? And how do we alleviate, or even better, prevent such a situation?</p>

<h3>First, we have to agree on what we mean by “tech debt.”</h3>



<p>And do to that, we need to confront some misconceptions about what tech debt is and where it comes from.</p>

<h3>Misconception #1: “Tech Debt” = “Code Shittiness”</h3>



<p>This is funny, I’ll grant, but it’s not super helpful, for a few reasons.</p>



<p>First of all, we have to agree what we mean by “bad code,” and when we haven’t done that, developers adjudicate “bad code” based on their personal perspective. I have watched developers sink literal months into completely restructuring working, maintainable code because it didn’t match their personal architectural preferences. This is not tech debt: this is one developer making a cavalier choice about the business’s resources. This is code <em>renovation</em>, not code maintenance.</p>



<p>Second of all, we tend to equate “bad code” to “code written by bad developers.” This is <em>also</em> not accurate—there’s plenty of illegible, hard-to-maintain code written by thoughtful programmers who were under constraints (more on that in <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/03/25/pearconf-talk-the-technology-and-psychology-of-refactoring/">this talk</a> about the technology and psychology of refactoring). Since no one thinks of themselves as a “bad developer,” they also don’t think of their code as an accrual of tech debt as often as it is—which is, always.</p>



<p>That’s right: all code incurs tech debt. Which brings us to:</p>



<h3>Misconception #2: Once you build a feature, it’s free. </h3>



<p>I don’t love comparing software projects to physical construction projects because it results in <em>a lot</em> of false equivalences. But it works in two cases: ticket estimation, and maintenance.</p>



<p>The work is not finished on a house after you build it. The building needs maintenance. The pipes wear out and you have to replace them. A hurricane rips the roof off and you have to replace it. A window gets broken and you have to replace it. The bigger the building, the more maintenance it needs. That’s an amount of work that you put into the building <em>outside</em> of renovations (the corollary for our pet refactoring projects) or adding new wings to the building (our corollary for adding new features—which, by the way, will <em>also</em> need to be maintained).</p>



<h3>Every software feature adds <strong>maintenance load.</strong></h3>



<p><strong><span>maintenance load</span></strong> – how much effort your development team spends to keep the existing features running the same as before. <strong>This</strong> is a more useful metric for technical debt than code shittiness. Maintenance load is a function of the age of the project and the practices used to build it. The unit: ongoing developer effort. Let’s talk about some maintenance load growth rates I’ve seen in my career.<sup>1</sup></p>



<h3>Yikes case: maintenance load growth of 1 dev per 18 months.</h3>



<p>If a team doesn’t write tests, doesn’t document how to use the features they wrote, and primarily employs an <strong>agglutinative</strong> coding style that values adding features by stapling them onto the existing code base, they tend to need one developers’ worth of effort focused <em>only</em> on maintenance for every 18 months this code base has been growing.<sup>2</sup> </p>



<p>I called this the “yikes case,” but it’s super common—not because all developers suck, but because…</p>



<ol><li>Up until ~2012, that was standard practice on software teams, especially young ones (young <em>teams</em>, not young <em>people</em>). It often still is. So any code written before 2012 probably did this.</li><li>These practices don’t really bite you until either a) your code base gets big enough that no individual person can understand it all or b) you experience your first <em>churn event</em> (the person who knows how this works leaving the team). By the time these practices cause a major problem, it’s too late: they’re already all over the code base.</li><li>Code stewardship is a whole, <em>difficult</em> skill that is <em>completely </em>separate from writing feature code, which is what most developers are a) trained to do and b) rewarded for. Developers are neither prepared nor incentivized to test, document, or communicate, and they’re also not empowered to rethink or remove features. I just made a <em>lotta</em> claims. We’ll come back to this later.</li></ol>



<p>The point is, if you’re working on a yikes-style code base that’s 4.5 years old, you would need 3 members of your team just to maintain it. I don’t mean clean it up. I mean hang on at the current level of maintenance, with the thing in roughly its current state, keeping things working.</p>



<h3>Average case: maintenance load growth of 1 dev per 24-30 months.</h3>



<p>Suppose the devs wrote some tests. They did some cursory documentation, but not everything is documented, and some of the docs are out of date. Occasionally something got rethought or removed. This team’s maintenance load is growing more slowly than the yikes team. They still add one full time developers’ worth of maintenance load every 2ish years. Once again, this isn’t to <em>grow</em> the feature set. This is just to keep the current one working. So in a code base like this that’s 10 years old, 4-5 devs are <em>just</em> on maintenance.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Woah, Chelsea. Your maintenance load estimate is bigger than the size of my team. Your number estimates are way too high.”</p><cite>– You, probably</cite></blockquote>



<p>Listen, maybe your team is running circles around the average case and totally on top of their maintenance load, and you don’t even need to be reading this. That’s awesome, I’m so happy for you! I wouldn’t count on it, though.</p>



<h3>Signs you shouldn’t count on it:</h3>



<ul><li>Your team has explicitly agreed with product to “take on” technical debt to get something done</li><li>The product has features that just straight-up don’t work, and y’all’ve all accepted it</li><li>There are apps, repos, or features that the whole team won’t touch, or will only go in nervously and change, like, one feature flag before dashing out like a child who hears a creak in an abandoned house. If these things ever <em>really</em> break, your team agrees, y’all’re screwed.</li></ul>


	<div>
		<figure>
							
										<figcaption>If your team sees this when they look at your repo, no, the maintenance load is not under control.</figcaption>
					</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>This isn’t a normative judgment on the conditions of your team. It’s not <em>wrong</em> to add a kludge that fills an urgent need for your constituents.<sup>3</sup> It’s not <em>bad</em> to put a <code>wontfix</code> label on a feature that no one wants. Abandoned houses in the code base are often the result of someone leaving the team without passing on their knowledge—not the mistakes of the current team.</p>



<p>But what these occurrences tell me is that your team is at its <strong>maintenance limit</strong>. Here’s why:</p>



<ul><li>Fixing the kludge would bring <em>down</em> the maintenance load.</li><li>Deleting a broken and unused feature would bring <em>down</em> the maintenance load.</li><li>Figuring out what’s happening in the abandoned house would bring down maintenance <em>anxiety</em>, if not specifically <em>load.</em></li></ul>



<p>We’ll come back to the abandoned house. These other two things? They <em>definitely</em> have a positive return on investment—and, as a product grows and ages, a <em>high</em> return on investment. Why would you not invest money in something with a known, high ROI? Because it’s money you don’t have. These symptoms tell me that the team <strong>doesn’t have more resources </strong>to spend on maintenance than they’re already spending. Your load is, at best, <em>right</em> at the rim of what your team can address. Realistically, though, it’s probably above what your team can address.</p>

<p>And the thing is, unaddressed maintenance load, over time, begets <em>more</em> maintenance load. For the same reason that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/it-is-expensive-to-be-poor/282979/">it’s expensive to be poor</a>, it costs more dev effort to not address the issues that siphon off your dev effort.</p>



<h3>Losing control of your maintenance load</h3>



<p>If maintenance load outstrips maintenance limit by enough, or for long enough, you get fires, outages, and breakdowns. The team spends a lot of time on call and ends up stressed out. They’re trying to write new features while keeping the existing product duct taped together.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting here that if your maintenance load is equal to the number of developers you have, you’re probably still above your maintenance limit. The reason for this is that developers usually want to make stuff, and while they’re applying duct tape to things, they’re not making stuff. When your developers start saying “I can’t remember the last time I wrote meaningful code,” you’re at risk of losing them to another team where they’ll hope to contribute to constituents’ experience. </p>



<p>That’s called <strong>churn</strong>—losing developers who know your product and replacing them with developers who don’t know your product. This is a <em>massive</em> source of maintenance load, because it causes <strong>context loss</strong>: when all the knowledge that the leaving developer had, but didn’t document, effectively evaporates. This is where abandoned houses come from, and this is one of the reasons that losing a dev can realistically cost the organization, all told, several times the outgoing dev’s annual salary. There’s a way to regenerate lost context, but it’s <em>expensive.</em> We’ll get there later.</p>

<p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-acquires-rad-game-tools">acquired RAD Game Tools</a> recently, which is another event in the worrying trend of an increasingly centralized game industry.</p>
<p>RAD Game Tools may be the most prolific game middleware company. Just watch for the "Bink" logo when starting up games and notice how widespread it is, to get an idea.</p>
<p>My goal with this article is to inspire some consideration as to where our industry is going, and what we should do as employees, business owners, and creators.</p>
<p>Note that I don't feel the need to present the argument for 3rd-party game engines, because I think it's already the default choice in most peoples' minds. The benefits do not need to be stated, because they are obvious. I also don't want to bash the big U engines' technology, which is no doubt good. However, even if it was perfect for every project (it isn't!), I think we should try our best to not sell our industry to a small number of companies.</p>

<p>Adobe and Autodesk are great examples for the software industry's natural tendency to become monopolized. Once one software product becomes successful enough, the owner gains the power to buy their competitors, as well as adjacent software.</p>
<p>While it may be convenient as a user to have access to a suite of creative tools, there's little stopping the company from changing their business model in a way <a href="https://www.change.org/p/adobe-systems-incorporated-eliminate-the-mandatory-creative-cloud-subscription-model">you find unacceptable</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games is positioning themselves to be in a similar place as these companies. From a business perspective, it is an excellent strategy. However, I believe it harms our industry at large.</p>
<p>When you use a 3rd party tool, you are at mercy of their scheduling and priorities. While the source code is available, it may become unfeasible to modify later on, or they may close parts of the source to gain competitive advantage over other engines. If you own your own technology, you can make the appropriate decisions for your business. Using the major engines isn't without costs.</p>

<p>When more people rely on an off-the-shelf tool to perform a task, there is less incentive to understand how that tool is created, and even how it functions.</p>
<p>Programmers who are intimately familiar with C and C++, and are used to managing their own memory, and having a good understanding of underlying processor architecture, are still very much in demand. The simple competitive edge that is had by having better performing games, that can render more, is enough to see that lower-level programming is still valuable.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that C++ will be the language of choice for AAA studios for at least the next decade. If you disagree, I doubt you are very familiar with the majority of AAA development. Even at studios which use Unreal, C++ is required to make new Blueprint nodes, or underlying changes to the engine. Unity is written largely in C++, and AAA studios pay extra for access to that code.</p>
<p>However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find strong C/C++ programmers, for three major reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schools are increasingly teaching higher-level languages like Python or Java instead of C</li>
<li>Unity is taking over the hobbyist game development market, which essentially requires the use of C#</li>
<li>Wide industry trends towards higher-level languages. This comes from a lot of different angles: people claim e.g. garbage-collected languages have no performance trade-off (they do, and that matters to games, a lot), most languages made today are higher level (Zig and Rust being notable exceptions), and there's a general discouragement of new programmers to learn C simply because they hear it's too hard</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if companies are increasingly using higher-level dynamic languages, <em>someone</em> still has to implement the runtime of those languages, which are largely written in C or C++ as well.</p>
<p>Would you rather have an industry where skilled, expert programmers were available at every company, or one where a select few companies hold those valuable assets? I prefer working at a company where programmers are unafraid of making completely new systems tailor-made to serve the game and business needs, unencumbered by an ours-vs-underlying engine code perception that discourages modification.</p>

<p>Building your own 2D paint program is not comparable to building your own game engine. With paint programs, you can create the same 2D image in more or less the same way, and have the result be identical across programs. Game engines do not function this way! The way you create games, and the way the game runs on end-user hardware are fundamentally different across different engines. Different performance, editors, APIs, feature-sets, etc.</p>
<p>This may be harder to recognize from an artist's perspective, where their main product, 2D/3D assets, are more or less plug-and-play across engines. (This is not actually true, because artists should be aware of their assets' impact on performance, which will widely vary with different engine technology).</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is that building your own paint program is probably unnecessary (though <a href="https://opentoonz.github.io/e/">professional animation companies</a>, for example, find customizing tools is necessary), whereas building your own game engine <em>is</em> often necessary.</p>
<h2 id="disjoint-feature-sets">Disjoint feature-sets</h2>
<p>Detailed analyses will reveal great differences between different engines. In-house engines often sport bespoke systems for each product. These will be more tightly integrated than any 3rd party feature could be. Only the features that the game actually needs are present, which reduces bloat and some types of maintenance burden.</p>
<p>There are games that would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOtxjOLst2k">fighting the engine</a> more than be helped by it. The following games are heavily reliant on custom engine technology:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Game</th>
<th>Reason</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Dreams</td>
<td>Better UGC via <a href="https://www.mediamolecule.com/blog/article/siggraph_2015">non-triangle-based renderer</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Man's Sky</td>
<td>Widespread use of procedural generation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rayman: Legends</td>
<td>Rock-solid high-definition 2D</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, these are just some games I think are particularly good examples. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74">CUSTOM GAME ENGINES: A Small Study</a> to get an idea how many studios opt to create custom engines.</p>
<p>Good engines tend to be built with a style of game in mind. Unreal Engine has a clear lean towards low-player-count single and multiplayer action and shooting games. Dig in to the Character and Controller source code and you'll find hard-coded fields that only make sense in these types of games.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean you can't make whatever you want in the engine, but it does mean that the engine is influencing what you make and how you make it. Our tools change what we make, and how we make it. For example, if No Man's Sky licensed out their engine, developers using it would be incentivized to make procedurally generated open-world games.</p>

<p>Major industry trends are often influenced by collective opinion. This means that your opinions and actions do have an impact, especially if you can prove to others that they are valuable.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineers">Software engineers</h2>
<p>Develop your lower-level skills as much as possible. Try to learn more about the machine instead of relying on increasing levels of abstraction. You may find it is rewarding to know as much as you can about these machines that have fundamentally changed how the world works. Low-level knowledge gives you much better ideas of the possibilities available.</p>
<p>Over time, you will gain a sense for how an overall technology stack "feels". For example, I think the Unreal Engine feels rigid and heavyweight. Pay attention to these feelings, and you'll find you have tastes for certain styles of tools and methodologies. Game engines can have great feature sets, but terrible development feel, and I believe that feel can change what you're willing to create with that tool.</p>
<p>Try not to support companies using the major 3rd-party engines with your expertise. This might not be an option when starting your career, but as you get a stronger resume you will have more options.</p>
<h3 id="building-an-engine">Building an engine</h3>
<p>I've <a href="https://macoy.me/blog/gamedev/ThinkTwiceBeforeUsingGameEngines">written before</a> about the things you should consider when deciding what technology to use.</p>
<p>The internet has an especially negative view towards anyone who claims to be building a game engine. Ignore these people, for these reasons (at least):</p>
<ul>
<li>They do not know your situation, the problems you are trying to solve, what you are passionate about, etc.</li>
<li>They likely have invested serious time into their decision (likely using a big-U engine), so they will partially be validating their own decision by putting down yours</li>
<li>They likely are not experienced developers, simply because there are way fewer professional game developers than hobbyists commenting on internet posts. Everyone tries to sound like an authority online, while hiding their true credentials</li>
<li>People and studios successfully build engines frequently!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're one of those people always discouraging engine-making, please try to imagine a world where one size doesn't fit all, because that's the one we are in.</p>
<p>The best thing for some hobbyists to do may be to write their own engine, if only for the huge amount of knowledge gained. For example, if you know how underlying skeletal animation works, you will likely not need any tutorial to figure out a 3rd party engine's animation suite, because the features all operate on those fundamental concepts. You may find you don't need all those features engines provide to make <em>your</em> project. A 2D game would vastly underutilize an engine like Unreal, which is designed for cutting-edge 3D games.</p>
<p>Even as an indie developer, developing a game without any existing "engine" is a viable strategy - <a href="https://gist.github.com/raysan5/909dc6cf33ed40223eb0dfe625c0de74">see again</a> how many hugely successful indie games use custom tech. If you write the game using only the lower-level libraries like OpenGL or SDL, your game will be easier to port (especially on long time scales; Unity projects from two years ago will already require you to make changes to run on the newest version), be less bloated, and may generally just make you happier to work on.</p>
<h2 id="designers-artists-etc.">Designers, artists, etc.</h2>
<p>Recognize the value of your existing proprietary engine, if you have one. For example, artists frequently request switching engines at my current company, without …</p></article></div>

                    </figure>

                <section>
                    <p>Cassandra is a popular, tried-and-true NoSQL database that supports key-value wide-column tables. Like any powerful tool, Cassandra has its ideal use cases - in particular, Cassandra excels at supporting write-heavy workloads, while having limitations when supporting read-heavy workloads. Cassandra's eventual consistency model and lack of transactions, multi-table support like joins, subqueries can also limit its usefulness.</p><p>However, using Cassandra as a metadata database for an object storage system introduces significant complexity resulting in data integrity and performance issues at scale - particularly if one wants to use their object store as a primary storage system. Object storage needs are far simpler and different from what Cassandra is built for.</p><p>Because the implications of employing Cassandra as a object storage metadata database were not properly understood, many object storage vendors made it a foundational part of their architecture - unfortunately it keeps them from ever moving past simple archival workloads into the modern workloads that define the future of object storage (AI/ML, analytics, web/mobile applications).</p><p>Let’s explore why in a little more detail.</p><ol><li>Cassandra was never designed to manage file or object storage metadata and it is predictably weak in this regard. It is <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/2.2/cassandra/dml/dmlTransactionsDiffer.html">not ACID compliant</a>. It does not have the rigidity to prevent partially successful writes, dupes, contradictions and the like. Cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys, and consequently does not offer consistency in the ACID sense. Further, there is no capacity to roll back transactions in the event of a failure. <p>While Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, it trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance. </p></li><li>Cassandra is categorized as an AP system in CAP. Meaning it trades Consistency for Availability and Partition tolerance. When employing Cassandra as a metadata database for an object store, you can either be fast or consistent - but not both at the same time. <p>Cassandra’s tunable consistency is a compromise, not a feature. Any setting other than <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html">QUORUM or ALL</a> means you are at risk of reading stale data. It is important to apply this consistency setting for both read and write operations in addition to the object data operations performed outside of it. </p><p>In the object storage world, the implication is that you can be good for archival use cases (write once, read very infrequently) or you choose a different architecture. </p></li><li>Similar to the consistency problem, durability guarantee is also a tradeoff between performance and correctness. The storage engine’s default <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/storage_engine.html">commit log</a> is set to sync periodically every 10 seconds. This means you will lose up to 10 seconds worth of latest updates in the event of power failure. The only reasonable way to make Cassandra durable is to use the synchronous batch mode committer which comes with a performance penalty. </li><li>Cassandra’s high-availability guarantee is not suited for erasure coded object stores. With a replication factor of 3 and consistency quorum of 2, Cassandra can only tolerate a single node / drive failure within a replication group. Increasing the replication factor and quorum consistency to 5 or higher serves only to make the meta performance go from bad to worse. Unlike replication, erasure coding can tolerate multiple servers and drives failures in a distributed system. Even if you have configured the erasure code setting to 6 parity (any 6 nodes may fail) in a 16 node setup, you are still limited by the weak link, i.e Cassandra’s replication factor. The ops team is often unaware of these high-availability surprises until it is too late.</li><li>Object storage systems organize the data in a tree structured hierarchical namespace. Since Cassandra does not support a hierarchical key namespace, you will have to build a tree data model on top for each directory prefix and also maintain a flat list for direct lookups without directory walk. Atomically updating multiple tables with batched commit log and full read / write quorum is slow and prone to &nbsp;corruption.</li><li>While objects themselves are immutable, the object storage system is mutable. When you add, remove, overwrite objects and its metadata, apply policies, collect metrics, grant session tokens and rotating credentials, the metadata is always mutating. Cassandra is not designed to handle this level of metadata mutation and definitely not for the primary storage workloads. Long term archival use cases where the objects are large (GBs in size) and infrequently accessed, will work - other use cases will not..<p>The reason is that Cassandra's log structured storage system quickly appends new writes to the end of the log file, but delays the deletes and overwrites with a tombstone marker. Vacuuming these tombstones is an expensive operation, because the actual delete operation is applied by copying the SSTables to a new table sieving the stale entries in the process. This operation has to be performed on all the nodes simultaneously. If you delay vacuuming, excessive tombstones will result in increased read latencies, memory GC pauses and failed queries. Some object storage vendors use an additional Redis database to offload Cassandra’s pressure. Using two databases to manage an object stores metadata is hardly elegant and introduces additional points of failure. &nbsp;</p><p>The biggest gotcha? You won’t see these problems until you are deep into production and it is too late.</p></li><li>Small objects (KB to MB in size) will fill up the metadata drives dedicated to Cassandra much sooner than the data drives. Also small object workloads exacerbate Cassandra’s limitations, because they are sensitive to latency and consistency issues. &nbsp;Some vendors store small objects entirely inside Cassandra to address this problem. At this point, you are merely looking at an S3 proxy on top of Cassandra database. <p>This too is a bad practice. </p><p>If you use your object store for large objects and employ erasure coding and use Cassandra as your data store for small objects and use replication - you have introduced a non-trivial SLA problem. In this approach, data is protected by different guarantees. Given that drives die all the time, the probability of serving an old object or a corrupted object goes up considerably. </p><p>As noted above, your metadata database is now the weak link. Availability, consistency and durability guarantees are only as good as the weakest link. If the weakest link employs replication (three copies) you can only withstand one-node or one drive failure before losing data.</p><p>A counter argument might be to replicate five copies. The result is a massive performance hit and you can still really only withstand two-node or two-drive failure. </p><p>In using replication for small objects and erasure coding for large objects you also undermine the efficiency gains associated with EC. If you only use erasure code for large objects (likely a small percent of your overall object pool) you don’t gain much but increase your exposure considerably.</p></li><li>Employing Cassandra as your metadata database for an object store also introduces a troublesome Java dependency. This in turn can result in bloatware and memory management issues. Cassandra taxes the JVM memory management with constant large scale metadata allocation and mutation resulting in memory exhaustion and garbage collection pauses. </li></ol><p>The obvious takeaway is that it is a lot more complicated to operate a Cassandra cluster than a properly designed object storage system. Cassandra is built for a different purpose and object-storage meta-data is not one of them. The areas where Cassandra struggles are the areas that are core to a performant, scalable and resilient object store.</p><p>The last point is of note - object storage is a natural fit for blob data and that is why Erasure Coding is so effective and efficient. Cassandra is designed for replication. When you use that model for metadata it breaks the object store’s erasure coding advantage (or at the very least makes it brittle and prone to breakage).</p><p><strong>Bottom line.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<p>In a <a href="https://tychoish.com/post/a-common-failure/">recent post</a> I spoke
about abandoning a previous project that had gone off the rails, and I've been
doing more work in Common Lisp, and I wanted to report a bit more, with some
recent developments. There's a lot of writing about learning to program for
the first time, and a fair amount of writing about lisp itself, neither are
particularly relevant to me, and I suspect there may be others who might find
themselves in a similar position in the future.</p>
<div id="my-starting-point">

<p>I already know how to program, and have a decent understanding of how to build
and connect software components. I've been writing a lot of Go (Lang) for the
last 4 years, and wrote rather a lot of Python before that. I'm an emacs user,
and I use a Common Lisp window manager, so I've always found myself writing
little bits of lisp here and there, but it never quite felt like I could do
anything of consequence in Lisp, despite thinking that Lisp is really cool and
that I wanted to write more.</p>
<p>My goals and rational are reasonably simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm always building little tools to support the way that I use computers,
nothing is particularly complex, but it'd enjoy being able to do this in CL
rather than in other languages, mostly because I think it'd be nice to not
do that in the same languages that I work in
professionally. <a href="#professional-decisions" id="id1">[1]</a></li>
<li>Common Lisp is really cool, and I think it'd be good if it were more widely
used, and I think by writing more of it and writing posts like this is
probably the best way to make that happen.</li>
<li>Learning new things is always good, and I think having a personal project to
learn something new will be a good way of stretching my self as a
developer. Most of my development as a programmer has focused on</li>
<li>Common Lisp has a bunch of features that I really like in a programming
language: real threads, easy to run/produce static binaries, (almost)
reasonable encapsulation/isolation features.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="on-learning">

<p>Knowing how to program makes learning how to program easier: broadly speaking
programming languages are similar to each other, and if you have a good model
for the kinds of constructs and abstractions that are common in software, then
learning a new language is just about learning the new syntax and learning a
bit more about new idioms and figuring out how different language features can
make it easier to solve problems that have been difficult in other languages.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, if you already feel confident and fluent in a programming
language, learning a second language, is really about teaching yourself how to
learn a new language, which you can then apply to all future languages as
needed.</p>
<p>Except realistically, "third languages" aren't super common: it's hard to get
to the same level of fluency that you have with earlier languages, and often
we learn "third-and-later" languages are learned in the context of some
existing code base or project4, so it's hard to generalize our familiarity
outside of that context.</p>
<p>It's also the case that it's often pretty easy to learn a language enough to
be able to perform common or familiar tasks, but <em>fluency</em> is hard,
particularly in different idioms. Using CL as an excuse to do kinds of
programming that I have more limited experience with: web programming, GUI
programming, using different kinds of databases.</p>
<p>My usual method for learning a new programming language is to write a program
of moderate complexity and size but in a problem space that I know pretty
well. This makes it possible to gain familiarity, and map concepts that I
understand to new concepts, while working on a well understood project. In
short, I'm left to focus exclusively on "how do I do this?" type-problems and
not "is this possible," or "what should I do?" type-problems.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">

<p>The more I think about it, the more I realize that when we talk about "knowing
a programming language," inevitably linked to a specific kind of programming:
the kind of Lisp that I've been writing has skewed toward the object oriented
end of the lisp spectrum with less functional bits than perhaps average. I'm
also still a bit green when it comes to macros.</p>
<p>There are kinds of programs that I don't really have much experience writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>GUI things,</li>
<li>the front-half of the web stack, <a href="#front-ends" id="id2">[2]</a></li>
<li>processing/working with ASTs, (lint tools, etc.)</li>
<li>lower-level kind of runtime implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's lots of new things to learn, and new areas to explore!</p>
</div>
<div id="notes">

<table id="professional-decisions">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>There are a few reasons for this. Mostly, I think
in a lot of cases, it's right to choose programming languages that are well
known (Python, Java+JVM friends, and JavaScript), easy to learn (Go), and
fit in with existing ecosystems (which vary a bit by domain,) so while it
might the be <em>right</em> choice it's a bit limiting. It's also the case that
putting some boundaries/context switching between personal projects and
work projects could be helpful in improving quality of life.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table id="front-ends">
<colgroup><col><col></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="#id2">[2]</a></td><td>Because it's 2020, I've done a lot of work on "web apps," but
most of my work has been focused on areas of applications including
including data layer, application architecture, and core business logic,
and reliability/observability areas, and less with anything material to
rendering web-pages. Most projects have a lot of work to be done, and I
have no real regrets, but it does mean there's plenty to learn. I wrote <a href="https://tychoish.com/post/theres-no-full-stack">an
earlier post</a> about the
problems of the concept of "full-stack engineering" which feels relevant.</td></tr>

		<p>Privacy is a human right, when so much of our life is lived online. In my opinion, the two most evil companies on the planet with a blatant disregard for privacy because it is so fundamental to their business model are: Facebook (and by extension, WhatsApp and Instagram) and Google. A common argument against the need for privacy that I have definitely heard in my family is “but I have nothing to hide”. Well, neither do I and yet so does everyone. Does anyone really appreciate searching on Google for a vacuum cleaner and then seeing photos of vacuum cleaners follow them around all over the web for months afterwards? But I digress: I made a conscious decision to gradually rid myself of Google (Facebook was easier: just delete the app) to the extent possible.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time researching alternatives to each of Google services, and the list below tabulates what I have settled on. Importantly, I have reached the conclusion that viable (and often superior) alternatives exist. Nothing in life is free: one can pay with one’s privacy or with cash. It is no surprise this that most of these below are paid services. Personally, I am more than happy to support businesses where I know what I am paying for and my data is not being pilfered to create some Frankensteinian advertising profile on me.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://ref.fm/u14223513">Fastmail</a> (email, contacts, and calendar): I have been using their email service for over a year now. They are a privacy-respecting email service based out of Australia. They’ve actually been around for a very long time: I remember a college friend in early 2000s (back when they were Fastmail.fm) showing me a cool feature to send a (fake) <em>email undelivered</em> response to an email. I believe they don’t have have that feature in their present-day incarnation. These days my most-used Fastmail feature is their ability to create an unlimited number of email aliases. I can create a new email address for every untrustworthy website and if I start receiving spam on an alias, not only do I know which website was the culprit behind it, but I can simply delete the alias and move on. Another favorite: the ability to block remote images (and as opposed to delivering them over a proxy server — see HEY below) which makes for a pleasant 90s-like (remember mutt?) text-only webmail interface. They have a high quality iOS app with both email and calendar. The service is mature and it has all standard email features (filters, forwarding, IMAP/POP, 2FA etc.). One situation where Fastmail beats Gmail is the ability to send emails from MATLAB or R, or from a cron script running on my own hosted domain: inevitably, these were rejected as “low quality” on Gmail. Well, I am not too keen on letting an AI make that decision for me. Unlike Gmail, Fastmail doesn’t hold immediate push notifications hostage for the native Mail app either.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more difficult task was to then go to all the places where I had signed up my Gmail and then replace that with my Fastmail address.</p>
<p>Yes, I do realize that the moment someone sends me an email from Gmail to my Fastmail (or when I respond to them), I am effectively enabling that same advertising profile. But we have to start somewhere and one can only hope that enough people will switch over from the dark side.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>: I mean, have you looked at Google search results lately? Once upon a time they used to be the 10 blue links company with one prominent and easily-identified, textual advertisement at the top. Contrast that with the situation now: it is impossible to find the organic result one wants amongst a sea of distractions and posers (ads cleverly disguised to resemble results). Admittedly, this Google service was the most difficult to be weaned away from, partly because when I tried DDG in the past, the results were less than spectacular. But I think the tide has turned now: DuckDuckGo is a viable and formidable competitor (remember when Google was just that against Altavista?) with two clear benefits: they have no intention to build an advertising profile on their users and there is a clearly demarcated ad at the top followed by organic search results. I am to understand that their results are based on Bing’s index. I would estimate that my average rate of going to Google when DDG can’t find an answer is 1 in 200, which is remarkable!</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.awstats.org/">AWStats</a>: This was easy. I just removed all Google Analytics code from my own domains. I cannot be, in good conscience, an enabler of that (creating advertising profiles based on which webpages a person visits) which I myself oppose.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>: Again, for someone who is 100% on the Mac/iOS bandwagon this is an easy one to accomplish. Of course, I have 1Blocker installed. The recent builds of Safari have this oddly satisfying Privacy Report where one can see how many of these creepy ad-trackers were blocked on a webpage and sometimes it is truly enlightening as to what the real business mode of some of the “free” websites is. For work, where we still use GSuite, I have isolated Gmail etc., into the Chrome browser. Firefox is an excellent alternative to Safari, especially for those not on Mac/iOS.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little Snitch</a>: A nifty little firewall for macOS to both see which apps are phoning back home (and where) as well as block any culprits from doing so. Bonus: they also sell another app called Micro Snitch that alerts the user whenever the camera or microphone are in use.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Apple Maps</strong>: This one is yet another example of a disappointing v1 that has now matured into a viable alternative. Maps is one area where my transition away from Google’s offerings is <em>not</em> complete: I still use Waze regularly mainly for their crowdsourced annotations (crashes, slowdowns, construction, etc.) which are unmatched on any other maps platform.</p>
<p>7. <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a>: This is definitely the new kid on the block. From the folks at Basecamp who have been writing software and books for over 20 years now, this is their “weird” interpretation of what email should be. It’s a bit pricey, no doubt, but what I did like was that I was able to get an OG email address <em>firstinitial lastname</em> @hey.com. HEY deserves a blog post of its own (coming soon).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have taken the first steps in a journey that is likely to be a thousand miles long. By documenting my experiences here, I hope others can learn about these first-class alternatives.</p>

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In trying to understand how aggression works, as well as aggressive emotions like anger, I decided to go to the animal literature.  Human psychology research is all too prone to being determined by researchers’ preconceptions, and we all have a lot of firsthand experience and personal agendas when it comes to theorizing about human behavior. It’s easier to get some distance when thinking about animals; we have less stake in any particular theory of how animal emotions work.  It’s also easier to set up experimental conditions with animals that would be hard to do ethically with humans, like keeping them in confinement and exposing them to stressors.</p>

<p>What the mammal literature says about aggression is that it splits neatly into discrete types.  Researchers disagree on exactly how many clusters there are, since there are inevitable judgment calls in defining taxonomies. And the pattern is somewhat different depending on species.  But one very consistent finding is that there <em>are</em> qualitatively different types of aggression.  They are governed by different hormones, activated in different situations, and seem to involve different subjective experiences.</p>

<p><strong>“Defensive Aggression”/”Defensive Rage” – Cortisol, Substance P</strong></p>

<p>A certain cluster of behaviors in mammals can be called “defensive aggression”, “affective defense,” or “defensive rage”. These behaviors are reactions to pain or immediate threat, whether that threat comes from a member of the same species, a member of a different species, or an inanimate object.</p>

<p>Defensive aggression is associated with negative emotions like fear and anger. It is aversive; a rat will learn not to push a lever that stimulates its brain in the same region that stimulates defensive aggression.  It is also associated with cortisol (the “stress hormone”), substance P (involved in pain perception), cholecystokinin (associated with panic), all suggesting that it is a reaction to frightening and painful situations.</p>

<p>Defensive aggression in some species seems to involve qualitatively different and “milder” types of attack (less likely to cause injury) than other types of aggression.  It is also prompted by the same types of situations and same regions of brain stimulation associated with fleeing, hiding, and submission signals (like baring the belly to get an opponent to stop attacking.)  And animals engage in defensive aggression reflexively when hurt even when there is no visible attacker; they’ll “attack” inanimate objects or the air, as though “letting off steam”.  Speculatively, these details suggest that defensive aggression is something of a reflexive “lashing out” when an animal is hurt or scared, not very well optimized to injure or intimidate an opponent, and have more in common with other self-preservation behaviors (like fleeing, hiding, or submitting) than with other types of aggression.</p>

<p><em>“Affective Defense”/“Defensive Rage” in Cats</em></p>

<p>“Affective defense” in mammals typically involves flattening of the ears, lowering of the body, drawing in the head, pupillary dilation, piloerection, hissing, and stiffening of the tail. It is triggered by either a conspecific or a member of another species who is perceived to be a threat.[18]</p>

<p>In cats, “defensive rage” behavior includes ear retraction, piloerection, back arching, pupillary dilatation, vocalization, unsheathing of the claws, and paw strike.  It occurs when a cat is threatened by either a member of the same or different species. Stimulating the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is generally a pain center, elicits defensive rage behaviors in cats.[21]</p>

<p>Various compounds associated with pain and stress, as well as acute ethanol intoxication, can affect the “defensive rage” response.</p>

<p>Blocking substance P, a substance involved in pain response, in cats reduces the defensive rage response to stimulation in the medial amygdala and medial hypothalamus.[22]</p>

<p>Ethanol enhances defensive rage responses in cats, while it reduces predatory attacks.[23]</p>

<p>Cholecystokinin, a neuropeptide and digestive hormone which causes nausea and induces panic when administered to humans, potentiates the defensive rage response in cats.[24]</p>

<p>Naloxone reduces the threshold for inducing defensive rage in the cat by brain stimulation; opioid receptor agonists block defensive rage.[57]</p>

<p>Defensive rage in cats appears to be inhibited by the medial hypothalamus.  Medial hypothalamus lesions make cats extremely defensive – they spit and claw in the presence of humans, they’ll run from a dog and fight if attacked.[48]  However, olfactory bulbectomy doesn’t affect defensive aggression in cats.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Dogs</em></p>

<p>The septal region in the brain is involved in inhibiting defensive aggression in dogs.  Septal lesions make dogs more “overexcitable, baring their teeth, and attempting to bite when handled.”[48]</p>

<p><em>Cortisol-Related Aggression in Hamsters</em></p>

<p>Syrian and Siberian hamsters are more aggressive in the winter (short-day condition) than the summer, despite their testes being smaller in the winter.  The increased aggression appears to be mediated by elevated cortisol, downstream of melatonin signaling.  In primates as well, seasonal rises in testosterone don’t always correlate to increased aggression, and exogenous T doesn’t always increase aggression. Just as in male humans, there is no correlation between testosterone levels and aggressive behavior.[33]</p>

<p>However, amygdala lesions suppress shock-induced fighting in hamsters.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Marmosets</em></p>

<p>As with cats and opossums, stimulating the marmoset ventromedial hypothalamus elicits aggressive responses, chiefly short attacks and vocal threats, as well as flight responses.[27]</p>

<p>Female marmosets attack intruders; the magnitude of the aggressive response correlates positively with testosterone level immediately after the attack.[92]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Mice</em></p>

<p>Defensive aggression in mice seems to be inhibited by the septal region of the brain and enhanced by the olfactory bulb, unlike hamsters and gerbils who do not have an olfactory bulb-dependent aggression response.[48]</p>

<p>Mice who have had their olfactory bulb removed do not fight back when attacked or exhibit fighting behavior after electric shocks. Peripheral anosmia does not cause this response, indicating that its effect on aggression is not due exclusively to the fact that it is necessary for smell.[48]</p>

<p>Septal lesions in mice enhance defensiveness; struggling, biting, and escaping.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Rabbits</em></p>

<p>Septal lesions increase defensive responses (like foot thumping) to human experimenters in rabbits.[48]</p>

<p><em>Defensive Aggression in Rats</em></p>

<p>Defensive biting in rats is different from attack biting; it is usually targeted at the snout, while attacking rats bite their opponent’s back; and defensive biting is seen <em>more</em> often against human hands or tools than against rats.  Defensive biting only occurs during or immediately after the defending animal has been hurt, and only when escape is impossible. Defensive biting also does not involve piloerection, while offensive biting always does.[4]</p>

<p>Defensive aggression is specifically selected against when rats are domesticated.</p>

<p>233 wild-caught rats were selected for “tameness”, that is, lower rates of aggressive behaviors towards human handlers, or “aggression”, that is, higher rates of aggressive behaviors towards human handlers, over 8-10 generations.  [1]</p>

<p>There was no difference in testosterone levels between tame and wild rats of both sexes; however, aggressive rats had significantly higher serum cortisone levels than wild rats, in both sexes.  Aggressive rats had significantly larger startle responses to …</p></article></div>

<p>Tesla (TSLA) has not given up on its dream of manufacturing cars by creating the entire body of the vehicle with a single-piece casting. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just opened up a little bit about this on Twitter, “With our giant casting machines, we are literally trying to make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made,” he said.</p>



<p>Just like metal or plastic toy cars are a complete body diecast, Tesla is trying to bring the same concept to real-world car manufacturing. Tesla’s success in this methodology will further advance the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/23/model-y-giga-casting-structural-battery-innovations-battery-day-part-1/">single-piece Giga Casting revolution</a> the automaker has brought with the introduction of the Model Y electric SUV.</p>

<p>The following video shows how toy car shells are carved out of a single piece of wood or metal, the phenomena Elon Musk is trying to import from the toy industry to the cars. Btw, this method used for toy cars is not new, the design and production seen in this video are dated back to 1965.</p>

<p>Last year, I <a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/patent-unibody-casting-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered a Tesla patent</a> that shows how the company envisions a giant unibody casting machine that would create the entire shell of the car (exoskeleton) in one go. When Tesla launched the Model Y and Elon Musk showed the single-piece rear and front underbody castings on Battery Day, some skeptics said that the unibody production concept was now dead.</p>



<p>But with the latest tweet by <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, Tesla did not stop at just two single-piece diecasts for new Model 3 and Model Y production, Tesla is still pursuing the idea of a monocoque Tesla car.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> is expected to begin production at the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-austin/">Gigafactory Texas</a> later this year that will mark the beginnings of the first Tesla exoskeleton. But the Cybertruck body is a stainless steel sheet folded to form the low-poly shape that this unique electric pickup truck has. </p>



<p>Making a unibody Model S, X, 3, Y, or a new car that looks normal will need an even bigger <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/09/11/tesla-fremont-factory-drone-video-shows-the-model-y-gigacast-machines-roadrunner-magic-cube/">Giga Casting machine than the ones we saw</a> at Tesla’s Fremont car factory (also currently operational at Giga Shanghai, see below photo).

<p>Those machines are giant Idra presses customized to create <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Tesla Model Y</a> underbody castings but what Elon Musk is talking about is an even bigger machine. A glimpse of this concept can be seen in the following blueprint illustration taken from Tesla’s patent of a giant unibody casting machine.</p>

<p>A machine this big can make the current Giga Casting machines look small. One thing to remember is that Tesla has not yet gotten approval on this patent (<a href="https://www.xautoworld.com/tesla/patent-unibody-casting-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get full patent pdf and details on XAuto</a>). After further fine-tuning, Tesla might file another patent or re-apply after changes, the important thing is Tesla and Elon Musk are not going to abandon this goal just because of an unapproved patent.</p>



<p>Although it is not clear when Tesla will be able to achieve the goal of creating an entire car using a giant casting machine but the future of automotive manufacturing has become more interesting.</p>

      <p><em>2019, October 11, 00:16:</em> <br>
I finish the cold frozen pizza that I made hours before but forgot to eat, finally write the report, press submit on the Google security bug submission form, and see the classic, <code>Thanks! We received your report.</code> message. That feeling is hard to beat.</p>

<p>I just submitted a bug, using which, I could simply send a link to someone, and when they click on it and visit my website, I could <strong>steal their YouTube watch history</strong>, the <strong>links to watch all of their unlisted videos</strong>, their <strong>Watch Later playlist</strong>, the list of <strong>videos they’ve liked</strong>, and more. It was pretty damn cool.</p>

<p>How was this possible? Let’s go back in time a little bit.</p>

<p><em>Already made some progress? Skip ahead to <a href="#chapter2" target="_self">Chapter 2</a>, <a href="#chapter3" target="_self">Chapter 3</a>, or <a href="#chapter4" target="_self">Chapter 4</a>!</em></p>

<h4 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: <br>Your special playlists you never created</h4>

<p>This issue requires a little bit of understanding about the inner-workings of YouTube. Most importantly, about these four interesting playlists:</p>

<p>Since YouTube is made up of videos, a bunch of internal stuff in YouTube is made up of <strong>playlists</strong>. Everybody has a few of them, even if they have never created one. I knew about these from previous research I have done (<em>by previous research, I just mean trying every feature and trying to understand how they work</em>), before finding this bug. Let’s look at these playlists one-by-one because they will be important later.</p>

<p><strong>The Watch History playlist:</strong></p>

<p>At the time of finding this bug, every YouTube user had a playlist with the ID <code>HL</code>, which stands for “History List” (I assume). This list contained every video you previously watched on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>The Watch Later playlist:</strong></p>

<p>You have probably seen the little <code>clock</code> icon everywhere on YouTube, which when pressed, adds the video to your “Watch Later”. This is also just a special playlist internally, with the ID <code>WL</code>.</p>

<p><strong>The Liked Videos playlist:</strong></p>

<p>This is a tricky one. At the time of finding the bug, I was a bit confused about how this works, so I had to use a little bit of guessing. All I knew, that it was constructed by somehow modifying your channel ID, which is a 24 char long string, and can be found by going to your channel page, and looking at the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"</span><span>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>"</span>
<span>-&gt;</span> <span>channel_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a bit of trial and error, and by looking at the playlists of my testing/personal accounts, I figured out a way to “guess” the special “Liked Videos” playlist. You just had to replace the first 3 characters of the channel ID with <code>LLD</code> or <code>LLB</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// one of them will be the “Liked Videos” playlist of the given channel</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>“</span><span>LLDvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>”</span><span>LLBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>And finally, the most important, the Uploads playlist:</strong></p>

<p>This special playlist contains <strong>all of your videos</strong>. It has everything in it, regardless of the video’s privacy setting. So all <code>Public</code>, <code>Unlisted</code> and <code>Private</code> videos you have ever uploaded, are in your special “Uploads” playlist.</p>

<p>At the time of finding the bug, the same guessing thing had to be used as for the “Liked Videos” playlist, but this time first 3 characters of the channel ID had to be <code>UUD</code> or <code>UUB</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// one of them will be the “Uploads” playlist of the given channel</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>“</span><span>UUDvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
<span>“</span><span>UCBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>”</span><span>UUBvX9uEO0a3fZNCK12MAgug</span><span>”</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, if you don’t want to do any of that, you can just go to the channel’s page, click the <code>Videos</code> tab, and click <code>Play All</code>. But only if that button is visible, which is unfortunately not always the case.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the details about how these playlists have changed since 2019, and how they work today at the time of writing this post, you can check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/xdavidhu/136c7dfa9247e4883c1e4dc7a77350e6">this Gist I made</a>.</p>

<p>So now you know about these special playlists every YouTube user has. Now, you might think that we should just open for example someone’s “Uploads” playlist like you would open any other playlist, and simply leak all of their unlisted videos:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// how to steal someone's unlisted videos (very easy!!)

1. Open https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=[victims-uploads-playlist]
2. Profit!?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. These playlists are special in another way too, which is that <strong>different users will see different videos in them</strong>. If the channel owner opens his/her “Uploads” playlist, she will see all of her videos, regardless of the privacy setting. If an attacker tries to open the victim’s “Uploads” playlist, <strong>only the <code>Public</code> videos will be shown</strong>, any other <code>Unlisted</code> and <code>Private</code> videos the victim has will just not be there.</p>

<p>As an attacker, we can clearly see that these playlists can contain very sensitive information about the users. We would like to steal these. But unfortunately, they seem to be well protected…</p>

<h4 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: <br>The Embedded Player and it’s API</h4>

<p>If you have a website and want to have a little YouTube player inside it, there is an app for that. And it’s called the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube IFrame Player</a>. Embedding this player into your website is quite easy, you just have to copy some HTML code with an <code>iframe</code> tag, and paste it into your site’s source:</p>

<p><img src="https://bugs.xdavidhu.me/assets/posts/2021-01-18-the-embedded-youtube-player-told-me-what-you-were-watching-and-more/embedded-player.png" alt="Screenshot of an empty webpage with an embedded YouTube player"></p>

<p>But today websites are rarely that simple, so you might wonder, what if I want to dynamically create a YouTube player with JavaScript? What if I want to automatically pause the video? These problems would seem quite hacky, or even impossible in some cases, due to the rules of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same-origin Policy</a>, and other protections modern browsers provide.</p>

<p>Thankfully, YouTube has a solution for this as well, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube Player API</a>. This API allows you to just add a JS library to your site, and then simply create/modify/control the YouTube players on your site however you’d like, using JavaScript. For example, if you want to pause a video, you can just call <code>player.pauseVideo()</code>.</p>

<p><em>Hm..</em> This is pretty interesting, but how does it work? The answer might be obvious if you have previously worked with cross-origin (iframe) communication. The YouTube player uses the browser’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage">PostMessage API</a>, which allows different origins (in our case your site and the YouTube iframe), to send each other little messages over a secure channel. So the YouTube player has a <code>postMessage</code> listener where it listens to commands, and the JS library you put into your site sends messages to it when you want to perform some action, like pausing the video. Actually, the YouTube player is talking a lot, even if you don’t ask it anything. It immediately tells the JS library on your site if anything happens with the player. This makes it possible for your site to add event listeners, which get called when for example the user skips into a currently playing video.</p>

<p>Let’s see a quick example of how this communication works under the hood:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this postMessage is sent from your site to the iframe under the hood when you call “player.playVideo()”</span>
<span>-&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>{</span><span>"</span><span>event</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>command</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>func</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>playVideo</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>args</span><span>"</span><span>:[],</span><span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>channel</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>widget</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

<span>// the iframe sends a lot of stuff back, here are some examples</span>
<span>&lt;-</span> <span>{</span><span>"</span><span>event</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>infoDelivery</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>info</span><span>"</span><span>:{</span><span>"</span><span>playerState</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>currentTime</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>duration</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1344</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoData</span><span>"</span><span>:{</span><span>"</span><span>video_id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>M7lc1UVf-VE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>author</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>""</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>title</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>YouTube Developers Live: Embedded Web Player Customization</span><span>"</span><span>},</span><span>"</span><span>videoStartBytes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoBytesTotal</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoLoadedFraction</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playbackQuality</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>unknown</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>availableQualityLevels</span><span>"</span><span>:[],</span><span>"</span><span>currentTimeLastUpdated_</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1610191891.79</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playbackRate</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>mediaReferenceTime</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>videoUrl</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7lc1UVf-VE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playlist</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>null</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>playlistIndex</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>},</span><span>"</span><span>id</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"</span><span>channel</span><span>"</span><span>:</span><span>"</span><span>widget</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just a reminder, I was often confused about this, but the “under-the-hood” commands I just showed an example of are sent <strong>by your site</strong>. By “under-the-hood”, I just mean that developers usually include YouTube’s library, to make communication easier, and that library simply abstracts the details away, so you can just call <code>pauseVideo()</code>, without worrying about anything else. But of course, if you would want, you could manually send these <code>postMessage</code>s to the player, via plain old vanilla JavaScript, and it would work in the exact same way as using the fancy JS library. So just think of it as an abstraction layer, which you have full control of.</p>

<p>If you want to see what <code>postMessage</code>s a page receives, you could just add an event listener to the page which prints every message to the console:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// listen for all “message” events and log them to the console:</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>message</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>){</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>)})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so we can play and pause the player with JavaScript. That’s nothing crazy, but it’s cool. Is there anything else we can do? Yes, there is. Actually, if you read the documentation, there is a bunch of stuff we can do using this Player API. Let’s see some of them that might look interesting to us:</p>

<p><strong>The <code>player.getPlaylist()</code> function:</strong></p>

<p>If you want to embed a playlist into your site, you can use the <code>player.loadPlaylist(playlist_id)</code> method of the library to load a playlist into an existing embedded player. After this, you could call <code>playVideo()</code>, and start playing the first video, after which, the next one from the playlist will automatically start playing, and so on. So we have playlist support.</p>

<p>Now, what if you want to embed a playlist into your site, but want to know what videos are in it? There is a <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Retrieving_playlist_information">function</a> for that as well. Calling <code>player.getPlaylist()</code>, on a player that has a playlist currently loaded, will return <em>an array of the video IDs in the playlist as they are currently ordered</em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>player</span><span>.</span><span>getPlaylist</span><span>()</span>

<span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>KxgcVAuem8g</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>U_OirTVxiFE</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>rbez_1MEhdQ</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>VpC9qeKUJ00</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"</span><span>LnDjm9jhkoc</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>BQIOEdkivao</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>layKyzA1ABc</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>-Y9gdQnt7zs</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good to know..</p>

<p><strong>The not-really deprecated <code>player.getVideoData()</code> function:</strong></p>

<p>If you look at the raw <code>postMessage</code> communication, often you can see an object named <code>videoData</code> being sent by the iframe to the page. This object contains a bunch of stuff about the currently playing video, …</p></div></div>

<p>Here's how to stop being so darn precious about your blogging: <strong>The third time you use an idea in a conversation, you have to blog about it.</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why</a></h2>
  <p>People often wonder what to blog about. You can get really fancy with Google keyword research and content calendars and the like. It's too complicated for me, and often leads to the kind of impersonal, SEO-driven blogposts that are slowly ruining the web.</p>
  <p>We need a simple, authentic heuristic to decide. Let's think about the upper and lower bounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's possible to blog too much — nobody wants you to broadcast every waking thought.</li>
    <li>But it's more likely that we are just <em>not blogging enough</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What's obvious to you is often not obvious to others. How often do you speak with someone and casually mention something that is new to them?</p>
  <p>Pretty often.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png" alt="xkcd 1053">
  </p>
  <p>It's natural to want to hold off publishing our insights and discoveries until the magical right time when it all clicks together in one beautiful, perfect essay that springs forth fully formed from our foreheads, making us famous and showing the world how smart we are.</p>
  <p>We want it so much we end up <strong>never writing it</strong>.</p>
  <p>This is how the world misses out on so much of our unique voices, taste, and perspectives.</p>
  <p>The Three Strikes Rule is designed as both a filter (for passing thoughts) and a prompt (for you to write more).</p>
  <p><strong>To stop being so precious</strong> about your blog.</p>
  <p><strong>To share ideas</strong> more openly and freely with your readers.</p>
  <p><strong>To <a href="https://www.swyx.io/create_luck/">Create Luck</a></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>To create one reference</strong> for that bunch of links you always end up searching for when you write or answer questions.</p>
  <p>And, quite honestly, <strong>to write shorter blogposts</strong>. Nobody has time to read the 3,000 word preamble to your magnum opus. It's a blog, not a physical book — you can return over time to expand it if it's worth it (like <a href="https://www.swyx.io/LIP">this</a> or <a href="https://www.swyx.io/how-to-name-things/">this</a>).</p>

    <p>Sidenote: Some people call these "blogs that grow over time" a <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden">digital garden</a>. The mental masturbation crowd prefer <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten</a> because it sounds foreign. It doesn't matter what you call it, it matters that you do it and grow it.</p>

  <h2 id="how"><a href="#how">How</a></h2>
  <p>Let's say we accept that "the 3rd time we reference an idea in a conversation, we have to blog about it". What does that really mean?</p>
  <p>I take an expansive view of what "ideas" and "conversations" means.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ideas</strong> includes great talks, good books, useful concepts, obscure names, handy definitions, copied-and-pasted code snippets, historical facts, surprising charts, and even blogposts by other people. (Yes, you can blog about other blogs. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-power-of-lampshading/">Like this</a>. Why not?) Sometimes the idea will be your own, most times it will be your takes on others'.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversations</strong> include in-person, on Zoom, on Twitter, wherever you communicate and exchange ideas.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The first time</strong> you refer to an idea, you probably just learned about it. It might be a fad; you may never find the idea useful again. Let it go.</p>
  <p><strong>The second time</strong> you refer to the idea, you should be taking note. Ideas are things we find useful in our day-to-day conversations, and there's probably a good amount of our readers who would too. But it might <em>still</em> fade away, so we hold off on it. It still needs to <strong>prove its usefulness</strong>.</p>
  <p>By <strong>the third time</strong> you refer to an idea, it's no longer a coincidence. It's a pattern. You're increasingly likely to refer to it again in future. It's marinated in your head for a bit, and you've likely gained some experience explaining it to others. It's also not so old that it may have lost relevance. It's time to write it down <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">to save keystrokes</a>.</p>
  <p>Do I <em>literally</em> write everything down after the 3rd time? No, sometimes the "three strikes" becomes the "five strikes" or the "ten strikes" rule, mostly out of laziness. But I know I <em>should</em>. With this rule, I find that I blog more and people still get value out of the core idea.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In case you were wondering... yes the "reference counter" on the Three Strikes rule itself got up to about 8 or 9 before I wrote this post. 🙈</p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="delivery"><a href="#delivery">Delivery</a></h2>
  <p>Following this rule will dramatically increase the volume of your output. There's then the question of how to deliver these high frequency things. There are a few methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tweet it out</li>
    <li>Dump them in a github repo (<a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">like this</a>)</li>
    <li>Split your blog from "only having essays" mode to having both "essays" and "notes". Publish separate RSS feeds for them.</li>
    <li>Buffer them up for a "grab bag post" like <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/what-ive-been-reading-183.html">Tyler Cowen</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personally, I am exploring doing this with a <a href="http://swyx.transistor.fm/">daily podcast</a>. See what works for you.</p>
  <p>If you're worried that people will think you're too noisy, you probably shouldn't.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"You’ll worry less about what people think about you when you realize how seldom they do." - David Foster Wallace, <em>Infinite Jest</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>I'd love for you to share great ideas more freely.</strong> Great ideas deserve to be shared, and your readers will appreciate it.</p>

      <p>I’ve released a new thing! Here it is:</p>
<p><a href="https://three-elements.hmans.co/"><img src="https://three-elements.hmans.co/three-elements-logo.jpg" alt="three-elements logo"></a></p>
<p>It’s a library that provides a <strong>Web Components layer for building Three.js applications</strong>. Wait, what? Okay, it lets you build something like this:</p>

<h2>Hey, isn’t that like…?</h2>
<p>What three-elements is doing isn’t entirely new, so how does it compare to other libraries in this space?</p>
<p>It might remind you of <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>, but unlike that library, it operates on a much lower level, providing what is just a super-thin wrapper around the Three.js API. Unlike A-Frame, three-elements requires you to have at least a basic understanding of how Three.js works; in turn it grants you much more immediate control over Three.js, adding just a thin veneer of convenience (see below) and then getting out of your way.</p>
<p>three-elements also doesn’t think of itself as a <em>framework</em>; beyond the built-in ticker with its callbacks, it doesn’t offer any sort of scaffolding for your code, but instead aims at integrating with existing web frameworks (of which there are so, so many) as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>three-elements might also remind you of <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber">react-three-fiber</a>. And rightfully so, considering it’s borrowing many of its core concepts – but of course it’s not a React library! If you ever wanted to use something similar to react-three-fiber, but didn’t want to commit to React, three-elements is for you. (And, yeah, you can also totally use it with React, too.)</p>
<h2>Using with a framework (or not)</h2>
<p>three-elements provides a set of Custom Elements and doesn’t care what framework you pair it with. Its elements are fully responsive; changes to attributes will automatically be applied to the wrapped Three.js scene objects. (Open this page in your browser’s DevTools and play around with the DOM a bit to see what this means!)</p>
<p>You can pair three-elements with React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, Elm, Imba, Lit-Element or any other framework you prefer, as long as it creates, updates and removes DOM elements. Build full games using jQuery? Sure, why not!</p>
<h2>Bonus Goodies</h2>
<p>In an attempted effort to reduce boilerplate in your projects, three-elements provides a small amount of convenience functionality that are useful in most Three.js projects.</p>
<p>It provides a full <a href="https://three-elements.hmans.co/guide/ticker-events.html">Ticker</a> that lets you run per-tick code like you’re used to from the big game engines. It has support for late updates, and will soon allow you to add your own fixed- or variable ticker events (eg. for animations or physics.)</p>
<p>three-elements also has the beginnings of a simple render pipeline whose most noteworthy features right now are <a href="https://three-elements.hmans.co/advanced/optimized-rendering.html">Optimized Rendering</a> and <a href="https://three-elements.hmans.co/advanced/stacked-scenes.html">Stacked Scenes</a>. The goal here is to provide a simple, but solid render pipeline that will work for 80% of all projects out there, but is easy to opt-out of in case you want to go crazy with your own setup.</p>
<p>three-elements also hooks into DOM events and makes <a href="https://three-elements.hmans.co/guide/input-events.html">handling input events super easy</a>. Want a clickable mesh? Just set its <code>onclick</code> attribute, and it’ll just work; all the raycasting and such that you would otherwise have to do yourself is already taken care of. (I think this is one of three-elements’ coolest features, and I definitely want to use the fact that every 3D objet is also a real HTML element for some other super-cool stuff in the future, like tabindexes and accessibility. Yup! 3D objects with ARIA attributes! Let’s do this!)</p>
<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
<p>I’ve just pushed version 0.2.0 of three-elements. It’s the first version that feels stable enough to let other people play with it. It’s still early days, so definitely expect some bugs as well as a whole bunch of missing or broken features. Remember, if you ever feel stuck or encounter something that doesn’t work, remember that you can always drop down into imperative code and interact with your objects directly if need be. (But seriously, when you find a problem, please <a href="https://github.com/hmans/three-elements/issues">open an issue</a>!)</p>
<p>I’m using three-elements in a real, big project – in fact, I have extracted it from that – so development will continue at a brisk pace, but I’m also looking forward <strong>so much</strong> to see what you will build with it! (If you have done so, please don’t hesitate to get in touch via <a href="https://twitter.com/hmans">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/ybuUjFM">Discord</a>!)</p>

    <article>
        
        <small>2021-01-18</small>
        <p>I recently <a href="https://changelog.com/posts/petal-the-end-to-end-web-stack">wrote about the PETAL stack</a> on Changelog.com and as I haven’t really had a chance to really get my hands dirty with it I decided that my next lab project should use it. So I set it up as a public repo and added the missing components manually by following some guides. You can <a href="https://github.com/lawik/pubd/commits/master">see the commits</a> or follow along.</p>
<p>So I used Phoenix 1.5.6 that I had already installed. The Phoenix docs should cover installation for you. My projects is called pubd, we’ll see if I get it go anywhere in that case that’ll be separate posts. I ran <code>mix phx.new pubd --live</code> to set up the Phoenix boilerplate project and that lead to <a href="https://github.com/lawik/pubd/commit/859d61827ed4d049863aeb4a2d1d726eb382ace0">this commit</a>. The <code>--live</code> flag indicates that it should give us LiveView.</p>
<p>The next part was based on <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2020/12/21/optimizing-user-experience-with-liveview">Chris McCord’s article about Alpine</a> on Dockyard.</p>
<p>So I ran these commands to install Alpine.js:</p>

  <div>
  
  <div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd assets
npm install alpinejs</code></pre></div>
  </div>


  <div data-file="assets/js/app.js">
  <p>assets/js/app.js</p>
  <div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// .. after the app.scss import
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>Alpine</span> <span>from</span> <span>"alpinejs"</span>;
<span>// .. in the let liveSocket configuration, after params
</span><span></span><span>dom</span><span>:</span> {
    <span>onBeforeElUpdated</span>(<span>from</span>, <span>to</span>) {
        <span>if</span> (<span>from</span>.<span>__x</span>) {
        <span>Alpine</span>.<span>clone</span>(<span>from</span>.<span>__x</span>, <span>to</span>);
        }
    },
},
</code></pre></div>
  </div>

<p>It lead to <a href="https://github.com/lawik/pubd/commit/f32030522b9c9ad22ec7464b9603a71a1100f61f">this Alpine installation commit</a> and afterwards I decided to verify that I could successfully invoke Alpine and added <a href="https://github.com/lawik/pubd/commit/918be370917b8d8813bb78b519836d4ed0853b9c">this other Alpine verification commit</a>.</p>
<p>Alpine was fairly straight-forward. Tailwind CSS was a bit more involved as that has much more dealings with preprocessing and the JS tooling. I followed the Phoenix 1.5 parts from <a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/adding-tailwind-css-to-phoenix">this guide by Pragmatic Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than restate their very nice tutorial here which feels rude I want to offer you two options. Either you work through the above tutorial and gain all that related context they so kindly included. Or you work through <a href="https://github.com/lawik/pubd/commit/812c99bd94403800bac656bbb016c893d5d5ae81">my commit diff</a>. Either way you should end up with a working Tailwind CSS install.</p>
<p>My approach included removing the default Phoenix styles which of course made the default application quite ugly. I couldn’t be bothered to fix that and instead I just wanted to make sure Tailwind was doing its thing. A commit for my test is <a href="https://github.com/lawik/pubd/commit/de8eeee5244506f9c323508da39568beb7577a58">also available</a>.</p>
<p>Now with these installed you should be able to get going with working in this stack. Assuming you know a bit about Elixir and Phoenix you should be quite capable of learning LiveView. And when that won’t suffice you have Alpine.js. If you need visual tools, you should have good use out of Tailwind, or so I hear. I’ll link their docs here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html">The Elixir language guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html">The Elixir documentation on Hex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.5.6/Phoenix.html">The Phoenix documentation on Hex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">Alpine JS GitHub docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs">Tailwind CSS docs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I genuinely look forward to digging into more work with this stack. I’ve heard plenty of hype for Tailwind CSS and the way they use classes looks utterly wrong to me so far. So it should be a novel challenge for my sensibilities. Maybe I’ll hate it? Alpine truly seems to follow the Tailwind concept, so that’s similarly noisy. Maybe that’s all good pragmatism. I hope to find out.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hadn’t seen a guide for setting up the PETAL stack so I figured I’d put one out there. Bare-bones as it is.</p>

          <article>

            <div><p>This is probably one of the biggest worries of those starting in the area of data science, learning/refreshing math</p></div><div>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eSHYWGTtQvBTy5I3iWspyw.jpeg" width="800" height="418">Image by DataSource.ai</p></div><div><p>Letâ€™s be honest, most people didnâ€™t do very well in math in school, maybe not even in college, and this is very scary and creates a barrier for those who want to explore this discipline called data science.</p></div><div><p>A few days ago I published a post in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/study-plan-for-learning-data-science-over-the-next-12-months-8345669346c1?gi=baf9ab7eeb05"><strong>Towards Data Science</strong></a><strong> </strong>and right here on our blog called <strong>â€œ</strong><a href="https://www.datasource.ai/en/data-science-articles/study-plan-for-learning-data-science-over-the-next-12-months"><strong>Study Plan for Learning Data Science Over the Next 12 Months</strong></a><strong>â€�</strong>, where I gave some quarterly recommendations and made an emphasis on studying mathematics and statistics for this first quarter, and from which I received many questions about exactly which materials I recommended. Well, this post answers those questions. But before that, I want to give you a context.</p><p>Leaving aside the factors or reasons that have led most people to hate math, it is a reality that we need it in data science. For me, one of the biggest shortcomings I found in mathematics was its lack of applicability in the real world, I didnâ€™t see a reason for intermediate and advanced mathematics, such as multivariate calculus. I confess that in school and college I didnâ€™t like them for that reason, but I always did well and got good scores and averages above the majority (especially in statistics). But I still didnâ€™t see how I could use a derivative or a matrix in the real world. I finally ended up as a software engineer and once I entered the world of data science I was able to make the connection between mathematics, statistics, and the real world.</p></div><div><p>On the other hand, it is important to clarify that we do not need a masterâ€™s degree in pure mathematics to do data science projects. As I mentioned in previous posts there is a big debate in the community about how much math we need to do a good job as data scientists.</p></div><p><strong>We could say that data science is divided into two major fields of work: research and production<br></strong><br>
</p><div><p>By <strong>research</strong>, we mean the part of research and development, which normally takes place within a large company (usually a tech company), or which has focused on cutting-edge technological issues (such as medical research). Or it is also an area that is developed within universities. This sector has very limited job offers.Â&nbsp;</p></div><ul>
<li>The great advantage is the deep knowledge of algorithms and their implementations, as well as being a person capable of creating variations of existing algorithms, to improve them. Or even create new machine learning algorithms.Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>The disadvantage is the unpractical nature of their work. It is a very theoretical work, in which often the only objective is to publish papers and is far from the business use cases in general. For reference on this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kw9xk7/d_has_anyone_else_lost_interest_in_ml_research/">I recently read this post on Reddit</a>, I recommend you read it.</li>
</ul><div><p>By <strong>production</strong>, we refer to the practical side of this discipline, where youâ€™ll use generally and in your day to day job libraries such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, and others. These libraries operate like a black box, where you enter data, you get an output, but you donâ€™t know in detail what happened in the process. This also has its advantages and disadvantages, but it certainly makes life much easier when putting useful models into production. What I donâ€™t recommend is to use them blindly, where you donâ€™t have the minimum bases of mathematics to understand a little of their fundamentals and that is the objective of this post, to guide you and recommend you some valuable resources to have the necessary bases and not to operate blindly those libraries.</p></div><div><p>So if you decide to focus on Research and Development, you are going to need mathematics and statistics in depth (very in-depth). If you are going to go for the practical part, the libraries will help you deal with most of it, under the hood. It should be noted that most job offers are in the practical side.</p></div><div><p>Well, after the previous remarks, it is time to define which are the specific topics needed to have an initial basis in mathematics for data science.Â&nbsp;</p></div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Linear Algebra</strong>: This subject is important to have the fundamentals of working with data in vector and matrix form, to acquire skills to solve systems of linear algebraic equations, and to find the basic matrix decompositions and the general understanding of their applicability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Calculus:</strong> Here it is important to study functional maps, limits (in case of sequences, functions of one and several variables), differentiation (from a single variable to multiple cases), integration, thus sequentially building a foundation for basic optimization. It is also important here to study gradient descent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Probability theory</strong>: Here you should learn about random variables, i.e. a variable whose values are determined by a random experiment. Random variables are used as a model for the data generation processes we want to study. The properties of the data are deeply linked to the corresponding properties of the random variables, such as expected value, variance, and correlations.</li>
</ul><div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: these subjects are much deeper than what I just mentioned, this is simply a guide of the subjects and resources recommended to approach mathematics in the field of data science.</p></div><div><p>Now that we have a better idea of the path we should take, letâ€™s examine the recommended resources to address this topic. We will divide them into basic, intermediate, and advanced. In the advanced ones, weâ€™ll have resources focused on deep learning</p></div><div>
<p><strong>Basics</strong>: in this first section of resources weâ€™ll recommend the mathematical basics. Mathematical thinking, algebra, and how to implement math with python.</p></div><p><strong>Price: Free<br></strong><br>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Learn how to think the way mathematicians do â€” a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.</p></div><div><p>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics â€” at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box â€” a valuable ability in todayâ€™s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.</p></div><p><strong>Price: $46.99 usd<br></strong><br>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Artificial Intelligence has gained importance in the last decade with a lot depending on the development and integration of AI in our daily lives. The progress that AI has already made is astounding with innovations like self-driving cars, medical diagnosis and even beating humans at strategy games like Go and Chess. The future for AI is extremely promising and it isnâ€™t far from when we have our own robotic companions. This has pushed a lot of developers to start writing codes and start developing for AI and ML programs. However, learning to write algorithms for AI and ML isnâ€™t easy and requires extensive programming and mathematical knowledge. Mathematics plays an important role as it builds the foundation for programming for these two streams. And in this course, weâ€™ve covered exactly that. We designed a complete course to help you master the mathematical foundation required for writing programs and algorithms for AI and ML.</p></div><p><strong>Price: $47.99<br></strong><br>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: You can learn a lot of math with a bit of coding!</p></div><div><p>Many people donâ€™t know that Python is a really powerful tool for learning math. Sure, you can use Python as a simple calculator, but did you know that Python can help you learn more advanced topics in algebra, calculus, and matrix analysis? Thatâ€™s exactly what youâ€™ll learn in this course.</p></div><p><em>This course is a perfect supplement to your school/university math course, or for your post-school return to mathematics.<br></em><br>
</p><div><p>Let me guess what you are thinking:</p></div><ul>
<li>
<em>â€œBut I donâ€™t know Python!â€�</em>Thatâ€™s okay! This course is aimed at complete beginners; I take you through every step of the code. You donâ€™t need to know anything about Python, although itâ€™s useful if you already have some programming experience.</li>
<li>
<em>â€œBut Iâ€™m not good at math!â€�</em>You will be amazed at how much better you can learn math by using Python as a tool to help with your courses or your independent study. And thatâ€™s exactly the point of this course: Python programming as a tool to learn mathematics. This course is designed to be the perfect addition to any other math course or textbook that you are going through.</li>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: Matrix Algebra underlies many of the current tools for experimental design and the analysis of high-dimensional data. In this introductory online course in data analysis, we will use matrix algebra to represent the linear models that commonly used to model differences between experimental units. We perform statistical inference on these differences. Throughout the course we will use the R programming language to perform matrix operations.</p></div><div><p>Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should …</p></div></article></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378071300_14862"><div><div><p>An increasingly familiar analysis begins with a vague tale involving rising dissatisfaction with elites, spiralling inequality, and growing political instability. The “twist” is that this describes not a modern Western society, but republican Rome. These comparisons often tend to be shallow, and therefore potentially misleading; is there anything to be learned from them? To answer this question, I turned to the book <em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny</em> by Edward J. Watts.</p><p>The key lessons I took from Watt’s narrative could be summarised as follows.</p><p>First, the high degree of social cohesion in early Roman Republic — the critical advantage that helped them defeat their rivals  — was the result of the main source of prestige being not wealth but honours, which were completely controlled by the Republic. Elites competed for such honours by providing services to the state, thereby channelling ambition into pro-social causes. Such a system was probably possible for two reasons. First, the elite was generally small and completely based in the city of Rome. Second, it was composed of wealthy landowners among whom there was little variation in wealth. These two factors taken together probably meant that the only way to rise in status was to obtain the honours granted by state service. </p><p>Second, once Rome began to expand, wealth began to increase due to the spoils of foreign conquest and later the gains from trade. Such wealth began to make the honours bestowed by the state seem somewhat quaint. But aspirant politicians also began to use this wealth to promote themselves, such as by hosting larger gladiator games. Such self-promotion was then leveraged to win offices. This new channel of self-promotion reduced the ability of the state to first require some pro-social efforts in order to obtain an honour. Before, you could only acquire honours by doing the state some service. Later, you could really only acquire honours by first acquiring wealth. </p><p>Once wealth was used to lock-in power, power was used to lock-in wealth. This positive feedback loop eventually incurred a populist backlash, the energies of which were used by successive politicians to undermine the system, to introduce dynastic politics, and eventually to establish an autocracy. </p><p>For a political system to avoid the descent into demagoguery, it needs to prevent a positive feedback loop forming between wealth and power. While the strength of that feedback loop varies across the West, it still seems to pose difficulties in many countries. Eliminating it either requires a reduction of inequality, or else creating a mechanism to prevent people from using wealth to influence the rules and processes regarding the selection of political elites.</p><p>But breaking this loop alone cannot create a cohesive society. For that, a social reward along the lines of the Roman honours system could be useful. In the below essay, I speculate about some ideas for how this idea could be implemented in a modern society. It involves creating a bottom-up selection process in small groups. Safeguards against nepotism or dominance by the wealthy could be overseen by a group that has no monetary wealth and/or children, as such a group would not have the ability and/or incentive to favour their children.</p><p>To understand how I came to take these lessons from the book, read on.</p></div><h3>Introduction</h3><div><p>The ghost of the Roman Empire looms over any discussion on the fate of societies. In the last decade, the course of events has causes the number of comparisons to rise. Trump tried but failed to be a Caesar-like figure in wielding populist sentiment like a weapon against democratic norms. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, compared the 2015 European migration crisis to the <em>Völkerwanderung</em> that heralded the end of the Western Roman Empire. </p><p>But does the story of the very different Roman society actually have lessons for our own? To answer this question, I turned to <em>Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny</em> by Edward J. Watts, Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego. It outlines in detail the events that led to Rome transitioning from essentially a highly cohesive aristocracy to the oligarchic autocracy founded by Augustus. The story starts not when Rome was at its most extensive, but when it was most cohesive — for it was this cohesion that enabled the rapid expansion that would come later. </p></div><h3>A Demonstration of Roman Social Cohesion</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378124246_16527"><div>

He won his first encounter with the Romans but at a cost of between one-sixth and one-half of his most highly trained soldiers. Despite being victorious, he could not continue to sustain such losses. Even worse for Pyrrhus, he couldn’t win the allegiance of any significant Roman allies in the south of Italy, and the Romans had no difficulty in replacing any killed or injured soldiers. He therefore needed to negotiate with the Romans. </p><p>His strategy for this negotiation included lenient terms and expensive presents. The Romans were initially close to accepting this offer but ultimately rejected it as the humiliation of defeat could have put Roman hegemony over Italy at risk, resulting in more threats in the future. </p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610378124246_25603"><div>

Noting that the Roman interlocutor, Fabricius, was relatively poor, Pyrrhus decided to offer Fabricius “so much silver and gold that he would be able to surpass all the Romans who are said to be most wealthy.” Fabricius refused the offer and Watts recounts his reply as follows:</p><blockquote><p><em>Fabricius, we are told, responded to Pyrrhus by informing him that his assumption was incorrect. Though he did not possess great material wealth, Fabricius told Pyrrhus, he did hold the highest offices in the state, he was sent on the most distinguished embassies, he was called upon to publicly express his opinions on the most important issues, and he was praised, envied, and honored for his uprightness. The Roman Republic, he continued, provided everyone who goes into public service with honors more splendid than any possession. It also regularly made an account of the property of Romans and could easily find anyone who had become wealthy dishonorably. What good would it do, Fabricius supposedly concluded, for him to accept gold and silver when this would cost him his honor and reputation? How could he endure a life in which he and his descendants were wealthy but disgraced?</em></p></blockquote><div><p>Pyrrhus did not win and eventually left Italy for good. But the above example illustrates an interesting point. Fabricius valued honour over possessions and wealth. And more importantly, wealth could not be used to purchase honour.</p><p>Because honour could only be attained by public service, the energies of the most ambitious Romans were channelled towards the common good. According to Watt, “Romans of the third century instead judged each man’s merit by the offices he held, the honors he earned, and whether his achievements equaled those of his ancestors.” This meant that the “Republic dictated what sort of service an individual gave, it determined what sorts of rewards he would receive, and it paid these rewards out in a form of social currency that it alone controlled.”</p><p>The system of honour included a series of offices known as the <em>cursus honorum</em>, where at a given age one was eligible to be elected to a certain post only if one had completed a previous position. The first step involved serving 10 years in the military. After this position and on becoming 30 years of age, one was eligible to run for the position of quaestor (thereby becoming deputy to a provincial governor or a financial administrator). This would last for one year. After this and on reaching 36, one could have served as an aedile. After being an aedile or a quaestor, and being at least 39 years old, one could have run to be a praetor.</p><p>Quaestors, aediles, and tribunes were all elected by the popular assembly and the <em>concilium plebis</em>. After being a praetor and attaining the age of 42 years old, one could have run for the consul position which was perceived as the peak of a career. Again, this position lasted for one year. Consuls and praetors were both elected by the <em>comitia centuriata</em>, which in practice was dominated by the wealthy.</p><p>This system lay within a constitution that seemed to balance the influence of the plebeians and the patricians. Interestingly, it was one where the Senate, made up of former high office holders, only had advisory power in theory but in reality exercised a great deal of informal influence and deference such that little happened without their approval. In a similar discordant fashion, the <em>concilium plebis</em> where the plebeians were represented had a great deal of power in theory — after 287 BC it could unilaterally make laws which bound all Romans — but it rarely exercised this prerogative, partly due to influence from wealthy plebeians. </p><p>This divergence between theory and practise would prove to be a vulnerability later …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here’s a thing I don’t see appreciated enough about Rust: <code>loop</code>.
I know I don’t think about it all that much,
but pretty much every time I use it I feel a bit of satisfaction.</p>

<p><code>loop</code> is just an unconditional loop:
it loops forever, or until you write <code>break</code>, or <code>return</code>.</p>

<p>Most languages don’t have it.</p>

<p>Instead, loop constructs usually have some kind of termination condition,
your <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops.
Apparently <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sather">Sather</a></em> has an unconditional <code>loop</code> keyword like Rust.
I only know this because a programming language historian mentioned it <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906#issuecomment-4240501">on the bug tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Why do I love <code>loop</code>?</p>

<p>Because it frees me from thinking about how to end a loop
before I’ve even started writing it.</p>

<p>Many problems are easy to recognize as ones that require a looping solution:
I quickly realize, “I have to do something multiple times”.</p>

<p>Sometimes that loop just involves iterating over a container of things,
one at a time.
That’s easy to recognize as a <code>for thing in things { }</code> situation.
Other loops have more complex conditions though.
Often when I’m solving a looping problem,
I will know one or some of the steps I intend to do in a loop,
but will not envision the complete solution ahead of time.</p>

<p>So I just write</p>



<p>and start coding what I do know needs to happen,
and work from there.</p>

<p>For some reason this feels great.</p>

<p>Once I have solved my looping problem,
there will be a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> somewhere in there,
or multiple <code>break</code>s and/or <code>return</code>s.
Maybe it makes sense to convert it into a <code>while</code> loop,
maybe not. But there’s not a great need
for <code>while</code> when you’ve got <code>loop</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>return</code>.
Do readers really need to know the loop termination condition
before reading what happens in the loop?
Or, in languages with <code>do { } while (…)</code> loops,
after the very end of the loop?
I don’t know,
but writing the termination condition
naturally wherever it “wants” to live in the loop
seems reasonable to me.
One does though need to be considerate of
their readers by keeping the loop body a readable length.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, a small project I’m working on right now
contains 2 instances of <code>loop</code>, 2 of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/while_let.html"><code>while let</code></a>,
and 8 of <code>for … in</code>;
no standard <code>while</code> loops.
And I think the <code>loop</code> loops read better than if I had
tried to convert them to <code>while</code> loops.</p>

<p>Here’s one example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>async_channel</span><span>::</span><span>unbounded</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>FsThreadContext</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>block_on</span><span>(</span><span>rx</span><span>.recv</span><span>())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"recv"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>msg</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>context</span><span>);</span>
            <span>},</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Shutdown</span><span>(</span><span>rsp_tx</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>context</span><span>.shutdown</span><span>();</span>
                <span>rsp_tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"send"</span><span>);</span>
                <span>break</span><span>;</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the other:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>header</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>line</span><span>.truncate</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>line</span><span>.is_empty</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"broken frame header"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>[</span><span>..</span><span>line</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>];</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>==</span> <span>FRAME_BODY_MARKER</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>header</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s common in C-like languages to write an unconditional loop
with <code>while (true) { }</code>.</p>

<p>I’m steeped enough in Rust that I don’t know if writing <code>while (true) { }</code>
brings others the same satisfaction as I get from <code>loop { }</code>,
but I suspect not: it looks and feels just like a tiny bit of a hack.
And if I go into writing a loop by first writing <code>while …</code>
then I am immediately presented with the question,
“while <em>what</em>?”,
and sometimes I just don’t want to think about that yet.</p>

<p>Besides <em>feeling</em> good,
there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">a technical reason that Rust has <code>loop</code></a>:
it helps analyze control flow.
With it, the compiler can trivially know that any code
after the loop is unreachable.
In Rust at least this is important for type checking.
This kind of analysis <em>is done</em> in other languages,
but by my recollection they sometimes actually
special case <code>while (true) { }</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the differences in how Rust
treats <code>loop</code> vs. <code>while true</code> <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=010dce12fdd4c0818322717e161a2f91">on the playground</a>.
Run it and check out the warning the compiler
issues; try to alter the example as suggested in the comments.</p>

<p>Bonus Rust trivia:
did you know that <code>loop</code> is an expression,
with the same type as its <code>break</code> statements,
and the result of <code>loop</code> can be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html#break-and-loop-values">assigned to a value</a>?</p>

<p>I did not!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">issue on the bug tracker</a> appears
to be the only remains of the design discussion around <code>loop</code> in Rust,
though it is insightful to the designers’ original thinking.
The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/weekly-meetings/2012-03-06.md">meeting minutes</a> where it was approved
just say there was consensus to add it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Unconditional loops are unconditionally awesome"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

<p>To see how it works, let’s go through this step by step.
The comment after each instruction shows the current values of <code>(x, y)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x ^= y # =&gt;                      (x ^ y, y)
y ^= x # =&gt; (x ^ y, y ^ x ^ y) = (x ^ y, x)
x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that this is really just using the properties derived earlier.</p>

<p>The fundamental insight here is that having <code>x ^ y</code> in one register and <code>x</code> in the other, allows us to perfectly reconstruct <code>y</code>.
Once <code>x ^ y</code> is stored (instruction 1), we can just put <code>x</code> into the other register (instruction 2), and then use it to change <code>x ^ y</code> to just <code>y</code> (instruction 3).</p>

<h3 id="application-2-finding-the-missing-number">Application 2: Finding the Missing Number</h3>

<p>Let’s finally solve the problem posed in the beginning of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are many straightforward ways of solving this, but we did set out to do it using XOR.</p>

<p>From the XOR trick we know that having a sequence of XOR statements means we can remove all duplicated arguments.
If we just XOR all values in the given list, however, we cannot apply this trick because there are no duplicates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code>A[n - 2]</code> is the last index of a list of <code>n - 1</code> elements.</p>

<p>What we can do additionally is to also XOR all values between 1 and n:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n ^ A[0] ^ A[1] ^ ... ^ A[n - 2]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will give us a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All values in the given list now appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.
This means that we are left with the missing value, which happens to be exactly what we were looking for in the first place.</p>

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># XOR of all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># XOR of all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>^=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just looking at the code, this seems to be a difficult to understand algorithm.
When knowing how the XOR trick works, however, it becomes fairly trivial.
I think that also shows why it is unreasonable to expect this solution in an interview: It requires knowledge of a very specific trick but not much algorithmic thinking beyond that.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the next application, let me follow up with two remarks.</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-this-beyond-integers">Generalizing this beyond integers</h4>

<p>While we worked on integers from 1 to n so far, this is not required.
In fact, the previous algorithm works in any situation where there is (1) some set of potential elements and (2) a set of elements actually appearing.
The sets may only differ in the one missing element.
This worked out nicely for integers because the set of potential elements just corresponds to the elements from 1 to n.</p>

<p>One could imagine applications where the elements are not integers from 1 to n:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The set of potential elements are <code>Person</code> objects and we ought to find the <code>Person</code> missing from a list of values</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are all nodes in a graph and we are looking for a missing node</li>
  <li>The set of potential elements are integers in general (not necessarily from 1 to n) and we want to find a missing integer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-instead-of-xor">Arithmetic operators instead of XOR</h4>

<p>If the algorithm still seems a bit magical – which I hope it does not – it might help to think about how one could achieve the same result using arithmetic operators.
This is actually fairly straightforward:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_missing</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span><span>):</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

  <span># Add all the values from 1 to n
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span># Subtract all values in the given array
</span>  <span>for</span> <span>value</span> <span>in</span> <span>A</span><span>:</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>-=</span> <span>value</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We add all potential integers and then subtract the ones actually appearing.
The solution is not as nice because one would need to handle overflows and because it requires the type of the elements to support <code>+</code>, <code>-</code> with certain properties.
It, however, has the same logic of elements canceling each other out because they appear a certain number of times (once positive, once negative).</p>

<h3 id="application-3-finding-the-duplicate-number">Application 3: Finding the Duplicate Number</h3>

<p>Here’s where it gets fun: We can apply the <em>exact</em> same solution to a similar interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n + 1</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is <strong>duplicated</strong>. Find this duplicated number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s think about what happens if we just apply the exact same algorithm as in the previous solution.
We would get a sequence of XOR statements where elements appear as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

    <p>There are a whole bunch of popular interview questions that can be solved in one of two ways:
Either using common data structures and algorithms in a sensible manner, or by using some properties of XOR in a seemingly hard to understand way.</p>

<p>While it seems unreasonable to expect the XOR solutions in interviews, it is quite fun to figure out how they work.
As it turns out, they are all based on the same fundamental trick, which we will derive in a bottom-up way in this post.
Afterwards we will look at a bunch of applications of <em>that XOR trick</em> ™, such as solving this popular interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array of n - 1 integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except one number, which is missing. Find this missing number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there are a number of straightforward ways to solve this problem, but there is also a perhaps surprising one using XOR.</p>

<h3 id="xor">XOR</h3>

<p>XOR is a logical operator that works on bits.
Let’s denote it by <code>^</code>.
If the two bits it takes as input are the same, the result is <code>0</code>, otherwise it is <code>1</code>.
This implements an <em>exclusive or</em> operation, i.e. exactly one argument has to be <code>1</code> for the final result to be <code>1</code>.
We can show this using a truth table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Most programming languages implement <code>^</code> as a bitwise operator, meaning XOR is individually applied to each bit in a string of bits (e.g. a byte).</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p>since</p>
<div><div><pre><code>0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because of this, we can apply XOR to anything, not just booleans.</p>

<h3 id="deducing-some-useful-properties">Deducing Some Useful Properties</h3>

<p>We can derive a bunch of properties from the previous definition.
Let’s go through them one by one, and then compose them to solve the interview questions previously mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="xor-and-0-x--0--x">XOR and 0: <code>x ^ 0 = x</code></h4>

<p>If one of the two arguments to XOR is <code>0</code>, then the remaining argument is the result.
This directly follows from the truth table by checking the rows where <code>y = 0</code>, namely the first and third row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="xor-on-the-same-argument-x--x--0">XOR on the same argument: <code>x ^ x = 0</code></h4>

<p>If the two arguments are the same, the result is always <code>0</code>.
Again, we can convince ourselves that this is true by inspecting the truth table.
This time we have to check the rows where <code>x = y</code>, i.e. the first and last row.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>1</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Intuitively, this means that if we apply XOR to the same arguments, they cancel each other out.</p>

<h4 id="commutativity-x--y--y--x">Commutativity: <code>x ^ y = y ^ x</code></h4>

<p>XOR is commutative, meaning we can change the order in which we apply XOR.
To prove this, we can check the truth table for both <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>x</code></th>
      <th><code>y</code></th>
      <th><code>x ^ y</code></th>
      <th><code>y ^ x</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>As we can see, <code>x ^ y</code> and <code>y ^ x</code> always end up with the same value.</p>

<h4 id="sequences-of-xor-operations">Sequences of XOR operations</h4>

<p>By combining all of this, we can deduce the central insight behind everything that is about to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The XOR trick</strong>: If we have a sequence of XOR operations <code>a ^ b ^ c ^ ...</code>, then we can remove all pairs of duplicated values without affecting the result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commutativity allows us to re-order the applications of XOR so that the duplicated elements are next to each other.
Since <code>x ^ x = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>, each pair of duplicated values has no effect on the outcome.</p>

<p>Let’s go through an example of this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>  a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b     # Commutativity
= a ^ a ^ b ^ b ^ c     # Using x ^ x = 0
= 0 ^ 0 ^ c             # Using x ^ 0 = x (and commutativity)
= c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because <code>^</code> is a bitwise operator, this will work regardless of what kind of values <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are.
This idea is really at the heart of how XOR can be used seemingly magically in many situations.</p>

<h3 id="application-1-in-place-swapping">Application 1: In-Place Swapping</h3>

<p>Before we solve the problem of finding the missing number, let’s start with this simpler <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/">problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swap two values x and y in-place, i.e. without using any helper variables.</p>

<p>It turns out that one can easily solve this problem using the following three XOR instructions:</p>



<p>That seems a bit mysterious.
Why do we end up swapping <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> if we do this?</p>

x ^= y # =&gt; (x ^ y ^ x, x)     = (y, x)
</code></pre></div></div>

      <li>once because they were in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The missing value appears exactly once:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we XOR all of this, we essentially remove all values that appear twice, thanks to the XOR trick.

<p>Coded up, it looks something like this:</p>

  <li>The duplicated value appears three times:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>twice because it was duplicated in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All other values in the given list appear twice:
    <ul>
      <li>once from taking all the values between 1 and n</li>
      <li>once because they were unique in the original list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As previously, all the duplicated elements cancel each other out.
This means we are left with exactly what we are looking for: the element that was duplicated in the original array.
This element appearing three times, combined with XOR, reduces to that very element:</p>


<p>All other elements cancel each other out because they appear exactly twice.</p>

<h3 id="application-4-finding-two-missingduplicate-numbers">Application 4: Finding Two Missing/Duplicate Numbers</h3>

<p>It turns out we can take this even further.
Consider the following, slightly more difficult, problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given an array <code>A</code> of <strong>n - 2</strong> integers which are in the range between 1 and n. All numbers appear exactly once, except <strong>two</strong> numbers, which are missing. Find these two missing numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As before, the problem is completely equivalent when looking for two <em>duplicated</em> numbers, instead of two <em>missing</em> numbers.</p>

<p>And I am sure you guessed it, but we will stick with what worked before and start exactly the …</p></article></div>

<p>Recently I've been reading about the theory of 1,000 True Fans.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a> founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_(editor)">Kevin Kelly</a> came up with it 12 years ago.</p><p>In an essay titled <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 True Fans</a>, Kevin says that if you want to have a successful business, all you need are 1,000 True Fans, each paying you around $100 a year.</p><p>1,000 x $100 = a yearly salary of $100,000.</p><p>Not bad at all!</p><p>Now, I think there's a lot of truth to Kevin's theory. But when it comes to numbers, he's a little off.</p><p>Based on my experience, to have a truly sustainable business, you need 2,450,000,000 True Fans.</p><p>That's it!</p><p>That's the magic number.</p><p>Once you hit 2,450,000,000 True Fans, you can rest easy.</p><p>But they have to be True Fans. They have to <em>really love</em> what you're doing.</p><p>For instance, nearly all of my 2,450,000,000 True Fans spend hours on my site â€“ every single day!</p><p>Eat your heart out, Kevin.</p><p>Even if each fan only paid me one cent a year, I'd still easily be making enough to get by.</p><p>But in my case, each of them make me a full $23!</p><p>That means that by having just 2.45 billion True Fans, I make $56 billion dollars a year.</p><p>Maybe that doesn't sound so great to you. But for me, it's been a <em>game-changer</em>.</p><p>Every time I log into my Stripe account and see $4.7 billion coming in every month, I feel a huge wave of relief. I know that I'll be able to handle the mortgage and finally pay off my student loan.</p><p>And, of course, I feel a wave of gratitude â€“ not just to my close-knit community of 2.45 billion True Fans, but also to the 500 million early adopters of my product. I couldn't have done it without those trailblazers.</p><hr><p>So if there's just one growth hack I'd recommend to indie hackers or creatives starting out along the long, hard road to financial independence, it would be this:</p><p><em>Try get at least two billion people to really love what you're doing.</em></p><p>A lot of people may try to tell you that having just 100, or even 1,000 True Fans will get you to where you need to be.</p><p>They're wrong.</p><p>You'll only be able to be <em>truly </em>comfortable once you get to 2,450,000,000.</p><p>That might seem like a big number now. But just wait until you have 31.4% of the world's population using your product on a regular basis.</p><p>Once you get there, I'm betting you'll remember that time, not long ago, when you read these words of advice and thought 'Hey...this growth hack is crazy, but <em>it might just work!</em>'</p><hr><p>Thanks to Louis Barclay (<a href="https://twitter.com/louisbarclay">@louisbarclay</a>) for allowing me the opportunity to write this guest post on the <a href="http://cloak.ist/">Cloakist</a> blog.</p>

        <p><em>Stale Bot’s</em> are a type of automated bot on Github, which locks issues which are “stale” (as in have no recent activity). This seems like a helpful tool at first, but in reality it’s terrible for all parties involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular has a popular repository</a> on github which receives hundreds of issues every day. They use the stale bot to lock old issues, which have no activity in order to reduce the amount of issues in the repository. On the surface the Stale Bot is doing great work, reducing the number of active issues in the repo, but in reality it’s a bit insane.</p>
<h2 id="Maintainer’s-perspective"><a href="#Maintainer’s-perspective" title="Maintainer’s perspective"></a>Maintainer’s perspective</h2><p>Issues are being automatically locked, new users can’t add to issue so they create a duplicate issue, or even worse, just don’t report that the issue still exists!</p>
<h2 id="User’s-perspective"><a href="#User’s-perspective" title="User’s perspective"></a>User’s perspective</h2><p>A user of Angular will <em>Google</em> the error text and will usually find the corresponding github issue. But more often than not, the issue is locked, by the heroic <em>lock bot</em>. So they have a few options, continue searching for another more recent (less SEO’d issue) OR either create another issue, effectively duplicating the bug.</p>
<p>If they decide to create a duplicate issue, it will often not be linked it to the original issue… Now there are 2 issues duplicating the same bug in the Angular repo, so what did “Stale Bot” achieve?</p>
<p>Well the stale bot has had the following effects on the repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce the metric of <em>Open Issues</em> in github</li>
<li>Made duplicate issues far more likely</li>
<li>Increased friction of users reporting that the issue still exists</li>
<li>Ultimately decreased the quality of the software, as the issues don’t accurately reflect reality</li>
</ol>
<p>For a moment, imagine that Stack Overflow did this. If there’s no interaction on a question, then the question should be locked… Well questions that don’t get consistent interaction are inevitably duplicated, or not updated with correct information, or people get frustrated and don’t ask the question again.</p>
<p>The best repo’s in my opinion, don’t prevent users from contributing to older issues. This gives a much better user experience, as friction to contribute to issues is much lower. It also lets the maintainers ensure that old issues aren’t needlessly duplicated. Finally, the community feels like the maintainers actually care about their input, which doesn’t feel that way when an automated <em>stale bot</em> locks and closes your inactive issue without any input from a human…</p>

            <h3>You're using TABs in a wrong way</h3>
        </p>

        <p>
            https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html
        </p>

        
        

        
        
        
        

        
        <p>Tabs or spaces? I'm sure you have a strong opinion on this subject, as probably everyone. Can we summarize the arguments for each side?</p>
<p>Advantages of TABs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using TABs means the source code uses less space. Each 4 bytes (2 bytes if you're a Ruby programmer, or sometimes 8 bytes) is compressed to 1 byte, so we're efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inserting TAB is faster than inserting few spaces. People often would feel stupid when they'd try to hit 4 spaces to add an indentation to a new code block. Also, navigation across the file is faster with TABs. Why hit <code>left</code> <code>left</code> <code>left</code> <code>left</code> when you can just use one <code>left</code> key to go backwards an indentation level?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's more flexible. You can use 2-character indentation if you want. You can later switch to 4-character indentation if you'd like. If you give your code to a co-worker that uses 8-character indentations per block, this won't be a problem, because TABs can abstract the presentation layer of the source code; you can use an editor option to modify the view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TAB is a character that is <em>made for</em> indentation. It has no other purpose. So why use something else instead?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's impossible to make a mistake in indentation, I mean it's impossible to half-indent a line. You either indent or don't, the outcome is binary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what do we have for SPACEs? I think I see just one advantage of using SPACE:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code looks the same, no matter the application or device you're using.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why are people still using SPACEs when it's clear that TABs are simply superior? Let's see how TABs behave on a few examples.</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_01.png" alt="tabs01"></p>
<p>In the example above we have a comment that is aligned with TABs. Current setting is 4-characters per TAB. What happens when we'll switch this setting to 8-characters per TAB?</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_02.png" alt="tabs02"></p>
<p>So I guess that arguments number 3 and 5 go out of the window. Can we debug it and see what is happening? Let's look at this again with more details; again, 4-character TAB setting:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_03.png" alt="tabs03"></p>
<p>And 8-character TAB setting:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_04.png" alt="tabs04"></p>
<p>So we see here that with 8-character TAB setting we have a superfluous TAB character in the second comment. So using TABs doesn't give you any separation of the presentation layer from the structure layer, because now we have to change our structure in order to have a desired look.</p>
<p>Another example. 4-character TAB setting:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_05.png" alt="tabs05"></p>
<p>8-character TAB setting, clearly the indentation is broken:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_06.png" alt="tabs06"></p>
<h2 id="how-to-fix-this">How to fix this?</h2>
<p>Actually you can't solve this by using TABs alone. You have to reinforce them with spaces. Use TABs only until the first non-whitespace character in the line. For the rest of your indentation needs, use spaces. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_07.png" alt="tabs07"></p>
<p>This way the 8-character TAB setting (like in the image above) works correctly, the 4-character TAB setting works correctly and 2-character TAB setting works correctly as well:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_08.png" alt="tabs08"></p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_09.png" alt="tabs09"></p>
<p>So remember, next time you're going to wonder why you shouldn't use TABs in situations like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_10.png" alt="tabs10"></p>
<p>is because after changing TAB setting you might end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://anadoxin.org/blog/youre-using-tabs-in-a-wrong-way.html/tabs_11.png" alt="tabs11"></p>
<p>Using spaces liberates you from such problems. Also you don't need to hit space 4 times in order to do indentation, because you can still use the TAB key. You also don't need to move through the file by using cursors alone, you can use <code>ctrl+cursor</code> key to skip whole words and all whitespaces at once.</p>
<p>The downside is that everyone will need to use your indentation level. Don't like 2-character indentation? Tough luck, try another codebase.</p>
<p>So the ultimate solution? Use TABs <em>and</em> spaces ;). This way you'll get the best of both worlds: flexibility and freedom on whatever TAB setting you'd like to use, and persistent look across all applications and devices.</p>

    <div>
                <p>Some sneakily cool features made it into the JuliaCall v0.17.2 CRAN release. With the latest version there is now an <a href="https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall#installation">install_julia</a> function for automatically installing Julia. This makes Julia a great high performance back end for R packages. For example, the following is an example from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffeqr/index.html">diffeqr</a> package that will work, even without Julia installed:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>install.packages("diffeqr")
library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
&nbsp;
lorenz &lt;- function (u,p,t){
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  c(du1,du2,du3)
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(lorenz,u0,tspan,p)
fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
sol &lt;- de$solve(fastprob,de$Tsit5(),saveat=0.01)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Under the hood it's using the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/">DifferentialEquations.jl package</a> and the <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML stack</a>, but it's abstracted from users so much that Julia is essentially an alternative to Rcpp with easier interactive development. The following example really brings the seamless integration home:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>install.packages(diffeqr)
library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
degpu &lt;- diffeqr::diffeqgpu_setup()
&nbsp;
lorenz &lt;- function (u,p,t){
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  c(du1,du2,du3)
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(lorenz,u0,tspan,p)
fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
&nbsp;
prob_func &lt;- function (prob,i,rep){
  de$remake(prob,u0=runif(3)*u0,p=runif(3)*p)
}
ensembleprob = de$EnsembleProblem(fastprob, prob_func = prob_func, safetycopy=FALSE)
sol &lt;- de$solve(ensembleprob,de$Tsit5(),degpu$EnsembleGPUArray(),trajectories=10000,saveat=0.01)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>This example does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automatically installs Julia</li>
<li>Automatically installs DifferentialEquations.jl</li>
<li>Automatically installs CUDA (via CUDA.jl)</li>
<li>Automatically installs ModelingToolkit.jl and DiffEqGPU.jl</li>
<li>JIT transpiles the R function to Julia via ModelingToolkit</li>
<li>Uses KernelAbstractions (in DiffEqGPU) to generate a CUDA kernel from the Julia code</li>
<li>Solves the ODE 10,000 times with different parameters 350x over deSolve</li>
</ol>
<p>What a complicated code! Well maybe it would shock you to know that the source code for the diffeqr package <a href="https://github.com/SciML/diffeqr/blob/v1.1/R/diffeqr.R">is only 150 lines of code</a>. Of course, it's powered by a lot of Julia magic in the backend, and so can your next package.

			<p>In which we wonder if Monopoly, the board game<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">1</a></sup>, is trying to establish a monopoly amongst retail board game space.</p>

<p>I first noticed this when I went to an F1 race at the Paul Ricard racing circuit back in July 2018. Given the quality of the racing there, utterly mundane, it’s not surprising I was looking for more interesting things to photograph. So I wandered into the gift shop, as you can usually find <em>something</em> of curiosity in those type of places.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2021/monopolys/ricard.jpg"></p>
<p>Even the box art and cover photo are terrible.</p>

<p>Buy. Sell. Negotiate. Win!</p>

<p>Who doesn’t want to play a version of Monopoly based on the Paul Ricard circuit? A track that hadn’t been used in twenty five years, was relegated to being a test circuit, then fell out of use due to testing restrictions being tightened, was only just back on the calendar, is based in the south of France miles from anywhere of interest, featured utterly boring racing, and was about as welcoming and as comfortable as a quarry?</p>

<p>It turns out that these Monopoly franchises are a thing. It’s almost like the owners of the game name and play mechanics are trying to, er, get some sort of hold on the board game retail space at the cost of far more enjoyable board games…</p>

<p>So I started to see more of these, and I started to collect photos of these rather than ever buying a copy because, well, I’ll get to that.</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2021/monopolys/monopolys.jpg"></p>
<p>Not quite a monopoly</p>

<p>Trying to collect photos of these things appears to be a pointless endeavour as not even the Monopoly Fandom page knows how many of them exist<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>. A good guess might more than 3,500 and less than 10,000<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">3</a></sup>. That is mostly down to, I imagine, there being a lot of variations based on any town or city that has enough vanity to create their own version. There’s a Lausanne version as seen in the above photo. Lausanne!</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Is Designed To Suck</strong></p>

<p>That’s the entire point of the game, to demonstrate the inequality in land/property monopoly<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">4</a></sup>. It’s about as enjoyable to play as a version of Snakes and Ladders that has no snakes or ladders. It’s purely luck based, another point of the mechanics, and is often played with “house rules” that drag the experience out over a number of hours rather than keeping it to less than twenty minutes of hate<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You roll the dice, you move your piece, you buy (or someone else buys) the property you land on. Repeat until all players but one go bankrupt. There’s literally no strategy in this game. None: <code>10 ROLL; 20 BUY OR PAY; 30 GOTO 10;</code></p>

<p><strong>These Things Are Everywhere</strong></p>

<p>Wander into your local tourist office and chances are high you will find one. Brick-and-mortar stores selling a miscellany of stuff might stock a handful, and if they have a dedicated games section they will probably have a dozen. Visit a dedicated board games store and the chances are high you won’t find any at all, not even the original version. What does that say?</p>

<p>Here’s one from the tourist office in the village:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2021/monopolys/vaud.jpg"></p>
<p>None of this makes sense!</p>

<p>Thankfully they didn’t go as local as having a version for the village because that would be stupid. And look at the price: 69.- CHF. Board games are not cheap in Switzerland but you can buy games like Wingspan, Azul, Catan, Root, Ticket to Ride, etc, for 50.- CHF or so in most board games stores.</p>

<p>What’s interesting about nearly all of the variations I find is that they must be some sort of licensed / franchised version of the game as the style of the box, board, font, chap in the top hat, are all clearly the same as the original version we are all familiar with. So it’s not like these are rip-offs - the owners of the various copyrights are in on this.</p>

<p><strong>So How Much Do These Things Actually Cost?</strong></p>

<p>I assumed nobody was creating these things because they are engaging board games, and more likely because they can make a tidy profit, so I started doing some Googling to find out how much it costs to create these custom variations.</p>

<p>I did find one site<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">6</a></sup> but it doesn’t seem to be affiliated with the rights holders of Monopoly since some of the artwork / fonts / branding are off - It turns out that you <em>can’t</em> copyright the mechanics of a game, so the mechanics of Monopoly are in the public domain, but you can copyright the various names, artwork, style, characters, etc. Since nobody wants to buy a copy of Monopoly that looks like a cheap(er) knock-off the official looking versions are the ones taking up all the retail space.</p>

<p>Anyway, this company sent me a quote which was 100 games for about 45.- CHF per game, 500 for about 15.- CHF per game, 2,500 for 9.- CHF, and so on. Pretty profitable if you sell them for 69.- CHF and can manage to shift the lot?</p>

<p>They don’t seem to be affiliated, as I said, so I searched a bit more and found another site<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">7</a></sup> that then led me to <em>another</em> site<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">8</a></sup> that looked to be more like what I was searching for - custom Monopoly variations with all the style and artwork of the well known one. So I submit their “contact us” form to get a quote. As I put nonsense information in most of the form I doubt they will get back to me.</p>

<p><strong>This isn’t Quite a New Thing</strong></p>

<p>While wandering around a games museum, in La Tour-de-Peilz<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">9</a></sup> of all places, we discovered a small exhibition on the history of Monopoly. They had some of the early copies of the game, which wasn’t interesting - I mean, the board hasn’t really changed in almost ninety years.</p>

<p>What they did have though was a couple of early variations:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2021/monopolys/old_monopoly_variations.jpg"></p>
<p>Early Swiss Monopoly variations</p>

<p>That’s Anti-Monopoly (II) - “The small business against the big monopoly”, Monopoly du Bataillon 9 - some sort of war version (from 1945) that is clearly Swiss given it references the Loterie Romande, and even Chomageopoly - chômage being the thing the [Swiss]French call unemployment benefit. How that works as a version of Monopoly I have no idea.</p>

<p>It should be said that I am in no way against expansions and extensions to board games - just have a look at my Catan shelf:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2021/monopolys/catan.jpg"></p>
<p>Sheep for wood?</p>

<p>However, all of these change the game in some way - new rules, different board layouts, more players, different mechanics. The Monopoly variations all seem to be exactly the same game with just the artwork changed, and there are <em>thousands</em> of them.</p>

<p><strong>Full Circle</strong></p>

<p>I decided to stop shooting photos of these things after finding this one (bottom) a couple of months ago, as it seems the mechanics have come full circle much like the board layout itself:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2021/monopolys/quick.jpg"></p>
<p>Does the ten minutes include setting up the board?</p>

<p>That’s right, “A Monopoly that ends in less than 10 minutes!”.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s just a curious observation. Monopoly is a shit game, stop buying it. If you absolutely must buy it, get that less than 10 minute version as seen above.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Social media sucks. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are designed to turn your precious free time into money. What we see as a nice way to stay in touch with our friends, in reality are just many hits of dopamine stimulating precise spots in your brain, leading to you spending more time on the platform consuming ads.</p><p>But what if I told you that there is a huge ad-free social network out there, not governed by a central authority, full of great people and completely free to use? This place is called the fediverse. Well, it's not really <strong>a</strong> place, it's many places.</p><h2>What is the fediverse?</h2><p>At its core, the fediverse is a mesh of interconnected nodes on the internet, all communicating in the same language. Every instance on the fediverse implements the <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a> protocol, which allows it to talk to other instances on the network. The phrase "Fedi" comes from "federated", meaning that content on the network is shared and accessible by anyone.</p><p>There are many different software projects for the fediverse out there. If you like the concept of Twitter, you could take a look at <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, a microblogging-platform for the fediverse. There's also <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>, a federated clone of YouTube (PeerTube recently <a href="https://framablog.org/2021/01/07/peertube-v3-its-a-live-a-liiiiive/">released support for peer2peer live streaming support</a>, like what?! 🤯). You like instagram? <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> got you covered. Of course, there are many other services worth mentioning, so feel free to dig around a bit! As mentioned, the great thing about the fediverse is that all of these services are connected with each other. If I signed up for an account on a mastodon instance, I can subscribe to your posts on Pixelfed, and vice versa. If I want to get notified about your videos on PeerTube, I can just go ahead and follow your account and comment on your videos.</p><blockquote><p>"This all sounds great, but why should I bother?"</p></blockquote><p>Let me give you 6 reasons why the fediverse is far superior to all other social media platforms out there, and why you should consider signing up for an account on one of the many instances of the fediverse.</p><h2>Reason 1: It's decentralized</h2><p>Regular social media platforms like Facebook have a <strong>single point of failure</strong>. If their servers go down, your content goes down with it. Content on the fediverse on the other hand is scattered around many instances, which means it is very resilient. If your instance dies, you can move to a new instance. This goes hand in hand with the next reason.</p><h2>Reason 2: It can't be censored</h2><p>You probably heard that the Twitter-account of Donald Trump recently got compromised by the owners of the platform. I don't want to engage in any political discussions, but the main flaw with this is the violation of <strong>freedom of speech</strong>. Even if everything someone says is controversial nonsense, it is still in his good right to express his thoughts.</p><p>On the fediverse, a scenario like this would certainly not happen, given its decentralized nature. Some instances still moderate their content, meaning that if someone posts inappropriate content, it might get blocked. The twist here is, if that person disagrees with the rules of the instance, he is free to join another instance.</p><h2>Reason 3: Free as in freedom</h2><p>There's this saying, criticizing modern software projects:</p><blockquote><p>"If it's free, you're the product"</p></blockquote><p>This is not true in all cases. "Free" can be understood in two ways.</p><p><strong>"Free as in beer"</strong> means that something might seem free at first glance (E.g. Free beer at Oktoberfest), but in the end you often leave with less than you came with. In the case of beer, you often buy another beer after the first free one. Therefore, even though you think you've saved the money for one beer, in reality bought an extra beer. In the case of proprietary software, it's a similar story. While you think that a service is free, you give up your privacy and get monetized with ads.</p><p><strong>"Free as in freedom"</strong> on the other hand means that you won't get "screwed over" like this. Most, if not all of the software for the fediverse is <strong>free and open source software</strong> (FOSS). If you don't like how a certain feature works, <strong>you are completely free to change it</strong>. You can look at the source code and propose changes to the main project, or launch your own spin of that product.</p><p>Since everyone can openly look at the source code, it is <strong>audited</strong> by many people, including security experts. This vastly improves the security and stability of the product. If the developers would do shady things, they will most certainly get called out by people, as soon as that code enters the main repositories. Proprietary (closed sourced) platforms like Facebook and Twitter can not be audited. The owners can do whatever they want, including spying on their users, or collect and sell the data of their users.</p><h2>Reason 4: It respects your privacy</h2><p>Since the software on the fediverse is audited by a lot of people, you can be almost 100% certain that joining an instance will not collect any of your personal data. If you are still concerned about your privacy though, you can still be part of the network by launching your own instance, with your own rules. There are tutorials out there, explaining how you can set up a small instance for a very cheap price on your local network.</p><h2>Reason 5: It's all about the community</h2><p>I used to spend a lot of time on "regular" social media platforms. From personal experiences, these platforms are all about promoting yourself and building up your follower count. Connecting with your friends is of little importance. In the eye of some people, you are not worthy to talk to if the amount of followers or likes-per-post didn't exceed a certain threshold.</p><p>It has now been about 5 months since I created <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@garritfra">my mastodon account</a>. Talking to people on the fediverse is a completely different experience compared to Facebook or Twitter. Almost everyone I talked to is a polite, grounded person, willing to engage in constructive and fun discussions. I met many people who disagree with my views, but instead of leaving a comment saying that this post sucks, all of them took the time to express their alternative opinions. Every member of the fediverse wants to drive the network forward, which is reflected in their posts.</p><h2>Reason 6: There's an instance for everyone</h2><p>Whether you're into Gaming, Painting, or Spanish dancing music, there is an instance for you. If it isn't, you are free to create one and promote it to people of that niche. You won't loose the social aspect by launching your own instance, since you are still available to other people on the network. If you just want to get started with the fediverse, I recommend that you check out one of the many <a href="https://instances.social/">lists of mastodon instances</a>. If you like instagram and want to stay in a familiar environment, take a look at <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>, and join an instance from the list they provide.</p><p>I myself am a person who cares a lot about free and open source software, therefore my choice of instance was <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a>, a mastodon instance geared towards awesome like-minded people.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This post has generated some interesting discussions on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25820646">Hacker News</a>.</p><p>This is post 005 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post, consider<!-- --> <a href="https://donate.slashdev.space/">buying me a coffee</a>!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>T</span>he beachfront narrows to an ocherous ribbon, belted by blue, above and below. After a while, a handful of shearwaters appear in the air above the <em>Cat Balou</em>. The birds flash around us; like knife-thrower tricks at a circus. Diving through the water, each is crowned in a diadem of bubbles. The shearwaters come from Antarctica, like the humpbacks, and also Siberia, South America, and Japan; they arrive in Australia, where they often die in large numbers from exhaustion. Such bird deaths, en masse, are known as â€œwreck events.â€� A single wreck event used to happen every ten years or so—the result of irregular, rough weather overtaxing the birdsâ€™ reserves—but flock-wide collapses occur almost biennially now, the feathered bodies washing up on the tideline, emaciated with hunger. Their prey are vanishing from the migration route as oceans warm. These shearwaters fly away, to where? I wish I could write <em>These birds leave in the direction of exquisite fortune, to live long, robust lives</em>.</p>

<p>From the cutwater, and either side of the boat, the watchers squint in all directions, and still there are no whales. A few people have given up, withdrawing to the lower deck for a rallying snack. I nurse a cup of instant soup, freckled with rehydrated corn and carrot, warming my hands. The light changes, the ocean turns waxy. Little slaps, notches and gloss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œThe whale who will come soon,â€� a boy begins, in the rising pitch of hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œThe whale <em>that </em>will come soon,â€� a man—I suspect, his father—corrects, not unkindly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we wait and the tour meanders on, I ponder whether the pronoun choice isnâ€™t, in fact, more than a semantic niggle. Designating a whale as â€œthatâ€� is distancing and turns the animal, grammatically, into an object. â€œWhoâ€� is personifying and brings the whale into a closer nexus with the speaker by implying it possesses human qualities. Australian newspapers, I think, use â€œthatâ€� for animals. (On returning to shore, I will go to <em>The Associated Press Stylebook </em>to clarify: the stylebook stipulates â€œwhoâ€� is appropriate only where an animal has been given a personal name, and it offers this example: â€œThe dog, <em>which </em>was lost, howled,â€� . . . â€œAdelaide, <em>who </em>was lost, howled.â€�) No doubt other languages have more middle-ground pronouns for animals—something between â€œthingâ€� and â€œkin.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go back up on deck to find the swell has lifted, shortening the depth of our perspective: the <em>Cat Balou </em>is dropped and raised. Water hammocks heap into hummocks, then fall back again. Clouds overhead loose bright patches to blow across the expanse, as if someone had unleashed a stash of foil Mylar blankets, the kind used for hypothermia. The effect is cyclically sedating and awakening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You believe you could step off the boat and walk for days. Things go on like this for a long while. Then Ros gets on the loudspeaker. â€œ<em>Whaleeey</em>,â€� she calls out, across&nbsp; the sun-blown sea. â€œ<em>Whaleeey whale! Here, whaleeey whale! </em>â€�</p>
<blockquote>We come to whales to be drawn out into the world, and yet the unpeopled sea is also a state of mind—an inner space.</blockquote>
<p><span>W</span>e come to whales to be drawn out into the world, and yet the unpeopled sea is also a state of mind—an inner space. Our smallness, set against this sublime sea, is connected to the notion that not all the thoughts within us are accessible, that there are thoughts, in some sense, <em>exterior to the self</em>. Vast feelings that slide, beyond command, beneath the wakeful tending of our days. The pleasure is that we are mysterious, even to ourselves. The fabulist ocean, this inscrutable outer space whales return from, in a metaphorical sense, enchants us with our own inward enigmas. Many throughout history have figured the sea analogous to the human unconscious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud most notably made popular the expression â€œoceanic feelingâ€� to account for convictions of limitlessness and eternality that might lead to an inclination for religious observance. Freud connected this belief to the irrecoverable sensations of being a baby—before an infant is aware of its separateness, when the contours of the self are blurred. A bygone time when, Freud claimed, each of us felt at one, with every surrounding object and phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itâ€™s often forgotten that Freud began his professional life as an aspiring naturalist with a passion for aquatic environments. Freudâ€™s college drawings are of the nerves in crayfish and lamprey. He studied under the Darwinist Karl Claus, and undertook fieldwork at a zoological research station in Trieste, on the Adriatic Sea, attempting to identify testicles in eels. Later, the concept of oceanic feeling came to Freud through correspondence with the dramatist Romain Rolland, a mystic who described himself as a member of an â€œantique species,â€� and whose work with eastern religions in the early twentieth century sought to explain the appeal of pious temperaments. After Freud, the ocean came to denote unbounded inner space, whether that sense of limitlessness formed around a spiritual consciousness or otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What ocean is this, that I have begun to call a <em>mare incognitum</em>? <em>Mare incognitum</em>—undisclosed sea. An imaginary place. Also, a mentality cast upon the globe. The purpose of this creation? The <em>mare incognitum </em>stands in for the unconscious, the unexamined interior. DÃ©jÃ&nbsp; vu, inner visions. Misreadings, mishearings, the ineffable. What fruits in dreams. Slips of the tongue and free associations. A place where subcurrents of pain are metabolized, and from which erotic desire and creativity supposedly spring. Intuitions: alien, animal, sordid, and stray. All of this has a sealike texture. Doesnâ€™t it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that the unconscious can be envisaged as a sea has its own history. It owes its existence to narratives about what the ocean represents in the Western tradition and the twentieth century, narratives addressing how human mentality functions, and whether an individualâ€™s sense of self, separate from her or his community, is even interesting to plumb (or decorous to expose). It is a trope composed in art, worship, literature. How does a space as boundless and ungraspable as â€œthe seaâ€� come to seem personal and intimate? It took a long time before I came to realize that the processes by which the sea was turned into a metaphor for a personâ€™s unconscious were neither natural nor private. I belong to these narratives—maybe you do too. I pick up whatever thing a dream washes onto my shoreline and turn it over to look, hoping for the shimmery incandescence of pearl shell and fearing, instead, the exposure of a writhing, unspeakable underside—an impulse unmentionable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question I am left with is: What will it mean for our inner lives—those of us who cannot disavow the ocean as a psychological motif—if the twenty-first-century sea turns out to be not full of mystery, not inexplicable in its depths, but peppered with the uncannily familiar detritus of human life? How will we delight in a feeling of unboundedness, in the apparent limitlessness, the unknowable space of our unconscious, if the real ocean demolishes its symbolic history?&nbsp;</p>
<p>An emotional landscape, it turns out, can also begin to acidify. Something hard to quantify, I suspect, disappears from the palette of human experience, from how we articulate our selfhood to one another, and from our relationship to our own private, inner depths, when we encounter evidence of the oceanâ€™s despoliation. Much fascinating scientific work is being done on how animals are learning to navigate the changing worldâ€™s new behavioral demands, but less is dedicated to how human cultures are adapting; how our language and imagination is corroded, and in what deficit of narrative and nature we seek for fresh expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without notice, weâ€™re off. The engine strains, and the prow of the boat tilts back, hit by slab after slab of spray. It becomes necessary to unlock your knees to take the impact and bounce of each wave, as when surfing—and itâ€™s excellent fun. No one can juggle a camera or binoculars now: weâ€™re all gripping to any available railing with both hands. A woman near me pukes a spectacular mustardy arc over the side. The womanâ€™s daughter looks on alarmed, from within the clutched tent of the waterproof jacket she has borrowed from her mother. She canâ€™t detach herself from clinging to a fire extinguisher, buckled to the exterior of the cabin (the only anchor point sheâ€™s been able to locate). I give her a grin, and my lip catches on a dry eyetooth, studding in the cold. All knuckles whiten. Seawater griddles the windows, glistens the boat. Whole-head smiles sweep through the group, like the beams from beacons atop dozens of crazed lighthouses. â€œWhoop!â€� yells a man in a Sea Shepherd sweater, his hair whipped up on end. â€œ<em>Whooop</em>,â€� retort people on the portside, louder. There are whales, there are whales! If this is being announced on the speaker, Rosâ€™s voice is lost to the drag of air.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Humpbacks? Yes, humpbacks. Now visible, white like little teeth. Are the whales leaping? Leaping! How many? Three? Four whales? We are gaining on them! Three. They are white, and also black, chrome blue, and mineral gray. Will the skipper slow the boat? At that very thought, the engine modes down and the reek of exhaust pulls over us, thick as a quilt. The fumes dissipate, and the whale-watching tour motors forward at a more moderate speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are putting on their sunglasses and taking off sweaters and lens caps. Weâ€™re jostling around the bow to watch the whales in the distance, salt air high in our nostrils. Homunculus whales at this interval, erupting from a patch of ocean without pattern. Gradually the boat homes in on them, and we can see the humpbacks sending up great crescents of salt water, slamming their bulk, over and over, against the seaâ€™s surface. I want to describe it as beautiful, …</p></article></div>

<article>
  <p>Go has plenty of useful builtin functionality for safe, concurrent and parallel code. However neat those features may be, they cannot write your program for you. As is the case for many languagges, the most important morsels of knowledge are not in the features of the language, but in the well-known <em>patterns</em> that compose those features into solutions that can address frequently reoccurring problems. I’m relatively new to using Go as my daily bread-and-butter language and recently encountered a useful pattern that I thought worth sharing. I’m told that at Palantir it is called the <em>tickler</em> pattern.</p>

<h2 id="the-tickler-pattern">The Tickler Pattern</h2>

<p>The tickler pattern addresses a very particular scenario:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have a service processing requests of some kind and looping forever,</li>
  <li>Calling the service should not block the caller,</li>
  <li>You optionally want to bound the amount of parallelism in the service, i.e. how many requests are processed at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The crux of the pattern will look as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <code>list.List</code> will represent the service’s internal queue,</li>
  <li>We’ll have the service loop forever, waiting for a signal to reconsider the contents of the queue,</li>
  <li>When a new request is enqueued, this signal is sent,</li>
  <li>When the service completes the work for a request, this signal is also sent,</li>
  <li>A semaphore puts a limit on the number of in-flight requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at the code and discuss these steps in more detail. We begin with our types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Dummy request -- usually some Protobuf/Thrift struct</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Request</span> <span>int</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Service</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>mu</span>         <span>sync</span><span>.</span><span>Mutex</span>
    <span>queue</span>      <span>*</span><span>list</span><span>.</span><span>List</span>
    <span>sema</span>       <span>chan</span> <span>int</span>
    <span>loopSignal</span> <span>chan</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll use a channel to represent a bounded semaphore. This is perfectly idiomatic in Go, although you could also use <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/semaphore"><code>sync.Semaphore</code></a> for this if you really wanted to. One of our explicit requirements for the kind of solution we wanted was that the caller shall never block when making a request. This requirement is met by the fact that we will always first enqueue a request, leaving its processing to be done asynchronously. Note that my solution will not provide a way to retrieve a response for the request.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>EnqueueRequest</span><span>(</span><span>request</span> <span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>error</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>mu</span><span>.</span><span>Lock</span><span>()</span>
    <span>defer</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>mu</span><span>.</span><span>Unlock</span><span>()</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>PushBack</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Added request to queue with length %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>Len</span><span>())</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>tickleLoop</span><span>()</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We acquire a mutex for our queue since we will have multiple goroutines accessing it concurrently. We enqueue the request and then notify the loop. The last part is explained in a bit. Now that we have a way of adding requests, we can work on the code to handle the requests. Since this is a service, we’ll have it loop forever waiting for new work to be done. This is also where the loop signal comes into play:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>loop</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"Starting service loop"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>select</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>loopSignal</span><span>:</span>
            <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>tryDequeue</span><span>()</span>
        <span>case</span> <span>&lt;-</span><span>ctx</span><span>.</span><span>Done</span><span>()</span><span>:</span>
            <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Loop context cancelled"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>return</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our <code>loop</code> method will have the service loop until the <code>Done()</code> channel on a context that we pass in is fulfilled. This will allow us to shut down the service gracefully at the end of our program, or in case an error occurs. More importantly, we wait for the <code>loopSignal</code> to tell us to <em>reconsider the queue</em>. This signal is sent on one of two occasions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When a new request is enqueued,</li>
  <li>When we finish processing a request.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can convince yourself that these are the only two events in the lifetime of our service at which it is necessary to consider the queue. If the service’s queue is empty, enqueuing a new request tells the service to look at this new request. If a request is enqueued but it cannot be handled right away because we’ve reached the limit on the parallelism we configured, the only time this will change is when a request completes processing, i.e. when the semaphore is replenished by one token.</p>

<p>Let’s now look at <code>tryDequeue</code>, which is called whenever the loop is “tickled”. Its unconfident naming stems from the fact that when <code>tryDequeue</code> is called, we:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Don’t know whether the queue has any requests at all, since the signal could have originated from having finished processing the last in-flight request,</li>
  <li>Don’t know whether we have sufficient resources if there is a request in the queue.</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>tryDequeue</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>mu</span><span>.</span><span>Lock</span><span>()</span>
    <span>defer</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>mu</span><span>.</span><span>Unlock</span><span>()</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>Len</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>select</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
        <span>request</span> <span>:=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>dequeue</span><span>()</span>
        <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Dequeued request %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>request</span><span>)</span>
        <span>go</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>process</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
        <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Received loop signal, but request limit is reached"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>dequeue</span><span>()</span> <span>Request</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>element</span> <span>:=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>Front</span><span>()</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>queue</span><span>.</span><span>Remove</span><span>(</span><span>element</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>element</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We check for the first case of uncertainty by testing the length of the queue. If we know we have work to do, we need to check if the semaphore has sufficient slots to allow for the request to be handled. Because our semaphore <code>sema</code> will be a buffered channel, we know that if the semaphore has no slots left, sending it a new token (the integer <code>1</code>) will block, or in this case trigger the default case. If we’ve reached our limit on parallelism, we simply punt on handling this request until the loop is tickled anew. The <code>dequeue</code> function is a little helper that takes care of the nasty business of popping an element from the queue, which is made to involve type casting because of Go’s lack of generics.</p>

<p>If a request passes the demanding tests of the <code>tryDequeue</code> function and is elected for processing, we take care of it in the <code>process</code> method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span><span>request</span> <span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defer</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>replenish</span><span>()</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Processing request %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>// Simulate work</span>
    <span>&lt;-</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>After</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Duration</span><span>(</span><span>rand</span><span>.</span><span>Intn</span><span>(</span><span>500</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>Millisecond</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>replenish</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>&lt;-</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Replenishing semaphore, now %d/%d slots in use</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span><span>),</span> <span>cap</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sema</span><span>))</span>
    <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>tickleLoop</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s really more interesting is the <code>replenish</code> function. This function has two responsibilities. First, it frees a slot in the semaphore so that a new request may be handled. Second, it tickles the loop to inform it that it’s a good time to consider the request queue again, in case there are requests that were blocked on other requests completing first. If you recall, this is the second of two cases in which the request queue must be reconsidered.</p>

<p>Let’s also lift the veil of mystery on the <code>tickleLoop</code> function. It simply makes a non-blocking send to the <code>loopSignal</code> channel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span><span>)</span> <span>tickleLoop</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>select</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>loopSignal</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>struct</span><span>{}{}</span><span>:</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we tie everything together in the constructor of our service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>NewService</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span> <span>requestLimit</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span><span>Service</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>service</span> <span>:=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>Service</span><span>{</span>
        <span>queue</span><span>:</span>      <span>list</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>sema</span><span>:</span>       <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>requestLimit</span><span>),</span>
        <span>loopSignal</span><span>:</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>struct</span><span>{},</span> <span>1</span><span>),</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>go</span> <span>service</span><span>.</span><span>loop</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>service</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We construct <code>loopSignal</code> as a buffered channel with one free slot. If the service’s loop is currently waiting for a value from the channel, a single send will tell it to reconsider the queue. If it is currently considering the queue but a request completes processing, we need to “enqueue” a signal so that when it exits <code>tryDequeue</code> and re-enters the context of the <code>select</code> statement, it knows to immediately reconsider the queue. The <code>sema</code> semaphore is a channel with sufficient buffering for the number of concurrent processing slots we wish to allow for the service. My <code>NewService</code> constructor starts the loop right away, but you could also make <code>Loop</code> a public method and do this outside of the constructor.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>A brief demonstration of our service in action is due:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>cancel</span> <span>:=</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>WithCancel</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Background</span><span>())</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>We create a cancellable context for the service that we use to signal the service to terminate its loop. For this demonstration, I bound the parallelism to three requests. The infinite loop at the end simulates running the service forever. Running this code produces the following output (out of many possible variations):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/headline.jpg" alt="The 4 steps to write a technical book"></p><p>For some people, publishing a book represents a dream, or lifelong goal, whereby they share a particular experience or subject matter expertise.</p><p>In narrative books, behind every story, there is a moral that is often hidden and not always easy to understand. With more “technical” books, it is different ― as it goes beyond simply sharing. More specifically, writing a technical book means being a point of reference with regard to a particular topic. When diving into a technical book, your reader will likely want to explore the “What if…” and “How do you…” questions.</p><p>Let’s start at the beginning. Sharing a product you have spent time, energy, and money on is rewarding. At least for me, it was! In December 2018, I published my first technical book (and definitely not my last) titled <a href="https://masteringmonero.com/">Mastering Monero</a> through <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/">Amazon Self Publishing</a> and alongside a <a href="https://masteringmonero.com/#credits">team of great people</a>. It was exciting to receive early feedback from readers who praised both the content and writing style.</p><p>On the other hand, it was an intense and difficult journey. Writing a book is not easy and takes time ― a lot of time. I spent many days (and even some nights) imagining, refining, and rewriting the content without the help of a publishing house. Along with all this, I had to think about other aspects, such as marketing.</p><p>In an effort to help aspiring writers, I thought it might help to write an article with some essential tips for your journey. By following a few simple steps (some that were initially ignored by me), you will be able to enjoy a little more of the crazy adventure you are going to face: writing your first technical book!</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we will discuss:</p><ul><li>Choosing Your Idea: What Do You Want to Write About?</li><li>Selecting the Audience: How Do You Want to Write It?</li><li>Writing the Table of Contents or Outline</li><li>Contacting Potential Publishers</li></ul><h2 id="choosing-your-idea-what-do-you-want-to-write-about">Choosing Your Idea: What Do You Want to Write About?</h2><blockquote><p>“If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.” – Toni Morrison</p></blockquote><p>“I have an idea…I’m going to write a book about X.” If that is what you thought this morning after a delicious breakfast and/or good coffee, I will stop you there. Any content, especially a technical book, requires a degree of expertise on the topic being discussed.</p><p>When writing a technical book, not only will you be showing an in-depth knowledge on the topic(s) discussed, you will also need to be able to convey complex information in a way that is easy for your readers to understand. Being able to explain complicated topics in a way that even your grandparents can understand shows your mastery of the particular subject matter being discussed.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/1_idea.jpg" alt="Choosing Your Idea"></p><p>Writing about areas of focus that you know intimately ― after having spent weeks, months, or even years studying ― will make the writing process faster and easier, since you will not have to do as much research. In addition, your writing will present you as a subject matter expert.</p><p>In some instances, you will find that while explaining a topic, you may have to research the subject matter in a bit more detail. This supplemental research and its supporting material will be beneficial to expanding your own knowledge base and helping set a basic, foundational understanding for your reader.</p><p>When considering a topic to write about, ask yourself about other books related to your subject matter that might already exist. Also, you should ask yourself why you should be the person to write about this topic. These are important questions that you should consider at the onset of your adventure. You might be hesitant, but determination counts for a lot!</p><p>If you just want to write your “dream book” and commercial success is not a major concern to you, then go ahead and just write whatever you would like! There is nothing wrong with this approach. Many authors begin by writing about the topic(s) that interest them most. The experience of writing your first book is invaluable, whether you sell 10 copies or 1,000 copies!</p><h2 id="selecting-the-audience-how-do-you-want-to-write-it">Selecting the Audience: How Do You Want to Write It?</h2><p>Without an <strong>audience</strong>, you have no perspective on the problem your book is solving other than your own experience. It is true that you should always try to solve your own problems first, but to be successful, you have to solve other people’s problems in the process. If you are not solving someone’s problem with your book, they will not buy it.</p><p>Put more simply, you will not have anyone to sell your book to. Sure, you can put your book up for sale on your website or on Amazon. It might sell a few copies, but having an audience that you can identify is critical to the success of publishing a book.</p><p>You do not necessarily have to write for a large market ― your audience does not have to be in the millions to get a book deal. What matters is that there should be enough potential buyers to make the book profitable for you and the publisher.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/2_public.jpg" alt="Find the right audience"></p><p>It is important to keep in mind that the audience sets the method of communication through which you will share your experience and knowledge. Unless, as an example, you are a university professor with tenure, avoid creating a purely academic and theoretical book. Otherwise, you readers will freak out!</p><p>Remember that you are not a professor, so ignore the idea of writing something like a university textbook. Getting a textbook adopted for a course is a rarity. For a textbook, most publishers will not engage with you unless you are a professor or a researcher with a PhD who is an expert in a specific field.</p><p>In your writing, be sure to give practical examples with solutions. When considering computer scientists, researchers, and engineers, they are looking for current information and knowledge that can be applied now to solve problems. It is fine to include relevant theory in a book for this audience, but keep it short and simple. Remember: write content that someone can use immediately.</p><h2 id="writing-the-table-of-contents-or-outline">Writing the Table of Contents or Outline</h2><p>A good way to start writing content is to sketch out your book. Your proposal should include a summary paragraph of the content, a definition of your intended audience, a statement of need and potential, and a tentative outline of the chapter title.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/3_write.jpg" alt="Writing Outline"></p><p>This is what a potential editor wants to see. In addition to this, many will want to see the preface and a sample chapter just to assess your writing ability and style. The entire exercise will provide you with a proposal to solicit publishers, but it will also reinforce your ideas.</p><p>Another important tip: Do not reinvent the wheel. Find as many other books and articles on your topic as possible and generate a list of them. Be comprehensive and scroll through (if not completely read) all of these sources.</p><p>Make a list of things you do not explicitly want to cover and reference the list of things you do not like about other books. Avoid the urge to start writing about elements of a topic you initially think are interesting unless you believe them to be relevant to your project.</p><p>For example, if a book is about the Bootstrap framework, you might not need an introduction to the history of HTML or how DNS works. On the other hand, an introduction to CSS and style rules might be a good section to include in your book.</p><p>When you have completed enough research to develop your ideas, you can use an outline to develop a draft of your proposal. As you write and review, you will continue to fill in details, add transitions, and present your acquired understanding of the subject matter.</p><p>Once you have completed a draft, let it sit for a few days before reading it again. This simple trick gives you a more unbiased view of your writing, and you will likely discover gaps you initially overlooked and improvements to be made.</p><p>Keep in mind that this is an outline of work and not a contract. As you continue your research, you may decide to organize the final proposal differently and even eliminate some information and add new sections.</p><p>If you follow the traditional model of publishing a book (i.e. with a publishing house), this section is for you. Once you have a specific topic for a book and a decent amount of content, it is a good time to talk with a publisher.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/technicalbook/4_publish.jpg" alt="Publish your technical book"></p><p>Take a look at books on the market that are similar to what you are writing to find out the names of publishers interested in your topic. Then, go to their website and contact an editor at the publisher to get a book proposal form. Publishers generally ask the same questions, though in different order.</p><p>A good proposal generally includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Your idea</strong> ― Provide a brief overview of the subject matter and how you want to discuss it. Be sure to write a summary built on top with all the key chapters. As always, it does not matter if you change this later. This just helps make your idea more concrete for the people who will be reviewing it.</p></li><li><p><strong>The market</strong> ― You need to explain to them why your book is a good idea. Speculate a bit about the potential market and communicate why you are the best possible author to write the book. Your goal is to convince publishers about your idea! Including years of experience and some events that have shaped your career might help too!</p></li><li><p><strong>A writing example</strong> ― To write a book, you need to show the publisher that you can write properly. Since editors will base their opinion on your sample, avoid grammatical errors or simple typos. From your text, they should be able to tell how interested you are in potentially publishing a book with them!</p></li></ul><p>In addition to what you have included in your cover letter, most will want to know how you might market it (e.g., blogs, websites, radio). And by “How you might market it?”, I mean that it will primarily be up to you to promote your book.</p><p>Send your proposal along with a cover letter to potential publishers. There are many, especially small ones like <a href="https://oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a>, <a href="https://nostarch.com/">NoStarch</a>, and <a href="https://packtpub.com/">Packt</a>. I will write an article later regarding the top publishers that I think have great potential.</p><p>When in communication with a publisher, <strong>never accept rejection</strong>. When faced with rejection, another secret is that it often has …</p></div></div>

    <h5>Posted on January 13, 2021 by Olivier Goffart and Simon Hausmann</h5>
    
  <p>
    With <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a>, we are creating a GUI toolkit. We chose
    Rust as the implementation language for our runtime library, and we want to make the same library usable from different
    programming languages. We believe programmers in all languages need to build GUIs - powered by the same runtime library.
    Rust, with its Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is an excellent choice.<br> In
    this article we look at how to expose an idiomatic C++ API from our Rust library.
  </p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>

    <p>Initially we chose to start with support for three languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rust</b>: Because it's our implementation language.</li>
        <li><b>C++</b>: It's a low level language that we're familiar with, and is still one of the most established languages
            in the embedded device space.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript / TypeScript</b>: Because it's a very popular dynamic language.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/diagrams.png"></p><p>The Rust library (also known as a crate) is split into two parts, the shared implementation crate and a thin idiomatic
        API crate.
    </p>
    <p>For JavaScript we use <a href="https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon">Neon</a> to expose an API. Neon enables us
        to conveniently write JavaScript APIs and create an NPM package.</p>
    <p>The C++ part is a bit more challenging.</p>

<h3 id="expose-idiomatic-cpp-api-through-ffi">Expose an Idiomatic C++ API through Rust FFI</h3>

    <p>We decided to keep the C++ API only in the header files. This is because, unlike with Rust, there's
        no widely adopted C++ equivalent of Cargo, to help with downloading and building dependencies. If we want to ship
        binaries, then we have to maintain ABI compatibility, which is difficult in C++.<br> This way, we can also keep the
        C++ binding as lightweight as possible: for performance and memory footprint.
    </p>
    
    <p>Rust cannot expose a C++ API: structures can only be exported using a C representation (<code>#[repr(C)]</code>) and
        <code>extern "C"</code> functions. This means that we cannot expose Rust features like traits, generics, or
        destructors even if they have a C++ equivalent.
     </p>
     
    <p>The Rust ecosystem provides a few helper crates to make the job easier:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen"><b>cbindgen</b></a>: This helper crate automatically generates C/C++
            header files based on the <code>repr(C)</code> structure and the <code>extern "C"</code> functions. We use
            cbindgen to generate internal header files only. It's very helpful to avoid manually writing some unsafe error-prone
            boilerplate. 
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp">The <b>cpp</b> crate</a>: This
            helper crate is useful when calling C++ libraries from Rust, and we make use of that. However it is not suitable for
            exposing a C++ API from Rust. (Note: Olivier Goffart happens to be the maintainer.)
        </li>
                
        <li><a href="https://cxx.rs/">The <b>cxx</b> crate</a>: This would be a safer way than cbindgen to ensure that the
            interface between C++ and Rust is correct. While it could be useful, cbindgen already get us a long way. So
            we don't use it for now.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>To build the correct shared library we use Cargo. The resulting library exports C mangled symbols. We ship
    a set of C++ header files that provide the C++ API and use the C functions behind the scenes. For convenience,
    we provide a CMake integration that ties together the library linkage and includes path setup. </p>

<h3 id="slices-vectors-strings">Slices, Vectors, and Strings</h3>

    <p>
    In FFI, passing a basic integer works out of the box. But what about more complex data types, like a 
    Rust slice or a string? Well, most classes like Rust's String, Vec, or slices are not <code>#[repr(C)]</code>,
    so we can't use them directly. While we could use these classes with an indirection, every simple call may need to go
    through a non-inline function boundary. So we would need to convert types, which means re-allocating memory.</p>
    <p>So instead of sharing code, we implemented data structures using <code>#[repr(C)]</code> and a stable ABI, so
        that they can be accessed directly from C++ and Rust, or any low-level language.</p>

   <p>For the slice we create a structure that holds a pointer and a size:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Slice&lt;'a, T&gt; {
    ptr: NonNull&lt;T&gt;,
    len: usize,
    phantom: PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a [T]&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Slice&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> can be dereferenced to <code>&amp;'a [T]</code>.
    In C++, cbindgen generates the following snippet:


</p><pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct Slice {
    T *ptr;
    uintptr_t len;
};
</code></pre>

<p>We tell cbindgen to generate that code in a <code>cbindgen_private</code> namespace, and we wrap it an interface
similar to <code>std::span</code>.</p>

<p>We use strings and vectors to pass data between the engine and the user's code. This results in
    shared ownership where we want to avoid unnecessary copying of data. Our API is property based
    with setters and getters, therefore we implement shared ownership through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"></a>Implicit sharing / Copy-on-write. </p>

<p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/sharedvector.png"></p><pre><code>#[repr(C)]
struct SharedVectorHeader {
    refcount: atomic::AtomicIsize,
    size: usize,
    capacity: usize,
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct SharedVector&lt;T&gt; {
    inner: NonNull&lt;SharedVectorInner&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}


/// These functions are called from the C++ constructor
/// and destructor
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_allocate(
    size: usize, align: usize) -&gt; *mut u8 { /*...*/ }
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
    ptr: *mut u8, size: usize, align: usize) { /*...*/ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Rust, the <code>impl Clone</code> and <code>impl Drop</code> make sure to increment
and decrement the atomic reference count and call the destructors. Similarly, in C++, we implement
copy constructor and destructor for the same purpose. Note that we still need to call the Rust
allocator function via the exposed C interface.</p>

<p>Now we can write a wrapper in C++:
(<a href="https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps/blob/master/api/sixtyfps-cpp/include/sixtyfps_sharedvector.h">full file</a>)
</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct SharedVector {
  SharedVector() : inner(nullptr) {}

  SharedVector(const SharedVector &amp;other)
    : inner(other.inner)
  { if (inner) ++inner-&gt;refcount; }

  ~SharedVector() {
     if (inner &amp;&amp; (--inner-&gt;refcount) == 0) {
        for (auto it = begin(); it &lt; end(); ++it)
            it-&gt;~T();
        cbindgen_private::sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
            reinterpret_cast&lt;uint8_t *&gt;(inner),
            sizeof(SharedVectorHeader)
                + inner-&gt;capacity * sizeof(T),
            alignof(SharedVectorHeader));
     }
  }
  SharedVector &amp;operator=(const SharedVector &amp;other)
  { /*...*/ }

  const T *begin() const { /* ... */ }
  const T *end() const { /* ... */ }
  void push_back(const T &amp;value) { /* ... */ }
  // ... more vector-like API

private:
  // (SharedVectorHeader is generated by cbindgen)
  cbindgen_private::SharedVectorHeader *inner;
};
</code></pre>


    <p>Right now these types, such as <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a>, are within the internal <code>sixtyfps-corelib</code>
        crate, and re-exported for Rust users through the public <code>sixtyfps</code> crate.  If there is demand for it, we may consider moving them into a
        smaller public crate with its own release schedule.</p>


<h3 id="destructors">Destructors</h3>

    <p>It's important to note that <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a> have destructors in C++.
        We can't pass instances by value in <code>extern "C"</code> functions, because the calling conventions are different
        for arguments or return types with C++ destructors; not supported by C. Therefore we can only pass them by pointer
        or reference.
    </p>

    <p>If we want to add a C++ destructor, constructor, or any member functions to types directly exported by cbindgen to our public API, 
        we use 
        <code><a href="https://docs.rs/cbindgen/0.16.0/cbindgen/struct.ExportConfig.html">cbindgen::ExportConfig</a>::body</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cbindgen_config.export.body.insert(
    "MyStruct".to_owned(),
    "    inline MyStruct(); inline ~MyStruct();".to_owned()
  );
</code></pre>

    <p>
    Then we implement <code>MyStruct::MyStruct</code> and <code>MyStruct::~MyStruct</code> in a manually
    written header file, by either doing the memory management directly or calling C helper functions
    implemented in Rust.</p>
     <p>It's important to keep in mind that anything allocated from Rust needs to be freed by Rust. 
    The same applies to allocations in C++: they might not share the same allocator.

<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch (virtual table) Across the Language Barrier</h3>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Bon_toutou.png/186px-Bon_toutou.png"></p><p>
    Let's start with the classic example of dynamic dispatch in Rust:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Animal {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String;
}
struct Dog { name: String }
impl Animal for Dog {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String
  { "Waf!".into() }
}
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn do_something_with(
  animal: &amp;dyn Animal
) {
  println!("{}", animal.speak(1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the above code does not work. How could we implement a class <code>Cat</code>
in C++ and call the <code>do_something_with</code> function? What if we wanted to implement
<code>do_something_with</code> in C++? The problem is that trait objects (<code>&amp;dyn</code>) are not
valid in FFI - their binary representation is not guaranteed to be stable. If we try to compile the above code,
we get this warning:</p>

<pre><code>warning: `extern` fn uses type `dyn Animal`, which is not FFI-safe
  | extern "C" fn do_something_with(animal: &amp;dyn Animal)
  |                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
  = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes_definitions)]` on by default
  = note: trait objects have no C equivalent</code></pre>

  <!--https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/trait-object.html-->
<p>Internally, <a href="https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology/1/all-about-trait-objects.html">we know</a> that
a trait object is composed of a pointer to the instance, and a pointer to a virtual table containing
pointers to functions. The layout of this trait object (which pointer comes first) and the layout of the virtual
table is an implementation detail of Rust. So we decided to re-implement them to work accross FFI. Instead of
writing a <code>trait Animal</code>, we write a virtual table by hand:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct AnimalVTable {
    speak: extern "C" fn speak(
        VRef&lt;AnimalVTable&gt;, i32, &amp; mut SharedString);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, our virtual table has only one function. It is <code>#[repr(C)]</code> so that
cbindgen can generate a structure that the C++ code can access. Since we can't use <code>String</code>
we changed the return type to <code>SharedString</code>. We also pass the parameter by mutable reference instead
of just returning it, because it is not allowed to return a type that has a destructor.<br>
Instead of passing a trait object, our functions receive a pointer to the virtual table and
a …</p></div></section></div></div>

January 17, 2021 | http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/teachinghaskell/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/teachinghaskell/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article">
        <p>I am teaching Haskell in the 1st semester CS master programme course <a href="https://www.lambdabytes.io/lecturenotes/concepts/index.html">Concepts of higher programming languages</a> at the <a href="https://www.fhv.at/en">University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg</a>. Why did I decide for Haskell and not Python, JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), Scala, Erlang, Rust, <em>Your Favourite Programming Language</em>?</p>
<p>At this point I assume and expect that students are not only familiar with mainstream object-oriented programming (Java, C#) but that they more or less excel in it - they don’t have to be experts (nor can they, unless they have worked for many years in the industry), but they should be very confident and be able to write larger, complex applications in a proper OO way.</p>
<p>Getting into another OOish language like Python, JS, TS would be simply a waste of time. Therefore, I was contemplating teaching the central concepts of Haskell, Erlang and Rust. For Rust that would be its <em>borrowing</em> feature and how it achieves safe memory management, for Erlang that would be <em>Actors and shared-nothing-semantics message-passing</em>; and for Haskell… well it would be <em>Monads</em> but for the students to fully get it I realised that I would need to give a proper introduction into the whole language (following along the lines of Graham Huttons brilliant Book <em>Programming in Haskell (2nd ed.)</em> and extending it).</p>
<p>So I decided to go for “Haskell only” and it turned out to be the right decision, especially for a course on <em><strong>Concepts</strong></em> <em>of higher programming languages</em>. Haskell allows to discuss many concepts in the context of a pure functional language which makes it especially suitable for such a course. Of course, some concepts the students “know” from OO as they have found their way into mainstream by now but the way these concepts are presented and need to be dealt with in Haskell is in such a pure way that students will learn and get the most out of it. Sure, I could have also decided to teach the concepts in JS but they would come across as muddled and not very clear - and some of these concepts would simply not have been possible in JS (or would have been a crude and ugly workaround, with the deeper idea completely hidden underneath).</p>
<p>I am very well aware that very few (none) of the students will pick up Haskell later in their day-to-day life as software engineers, however it is my firm belief that the way this course taught them these concepts, will have made them much better developers, because they have a broader and deeper understanding of them. The main concepts I chose to teach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Static Types, immutable data, basic functions</strong>. Dealing with a really strong static type system (yes I know Java is also statically typed but as long as you have dynamic dispatch there is some runtime-type information around…), immutable data and pure functions is a challenge on its own, forcing the students to think very different about what they know so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit Recursion</strong>. No more mutable data, therefore we employ recursion instead of iteration and in-place memory updates. To think recursively takes a while but is probably among the most important abilities for computer scientists and it can never hurt to reiterate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher-Order Functions</strong>. Probably the most essential concept to learn in this pure form in Haskell. The way it works in Haskell in combination with Currying and Lambdas is tremendously powerful, which is also realised by students. This concept has entered mainstream OO languages by now, therefore students are able to pick it up quickly and see why it is useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lambdas</strong>. Have arrived in mainstream OO as well and students quickly understand the use of anonymous functions to write concise code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Currying</strong>. Tremendously powerful concept, not available in this form in mainstream OO - yes you can hack a workaround which looks like currying but the way it comes across in Haskell is simply beautiful. When telling students that it can be understood as <em>Dependency Injection</em> the penny drops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Definitions</strong>. How can we define data types when there are no objects? ADTs is a very valuable lesson to learn, especially to teach recursive data types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pattern Matching</strong>. Probably the most elegant feature of functional programming in general and invaluable to write concise recursive functions. It is still a mystery to me why Java has not properly implemented pattern matching yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lazy Evaluation</strong>. The concept of separating the producer from the consumer is extremely powerful and important on its own, left alone infinite data structures and functions on them. These concepts can be emulated to some extent in OO languages (for example with an <em>Iterator</em> or <em>Streams</em>), however it is nowhere as compelling and pure as in Haskell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Type Classes</strong>. To show students that polymorphism is <strong>not</strong> a unique feature of OO but that it is a fundamental concept allowing to express abstract concepts, facilitating code reuse (among others) and allows to express laws and concepts of a specific type. Students generally understand Type Classes as <em>a kind of interface</em> (in Java terms), which is fine for me and not far from the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functors</strong>. Seeing how to apply already existing functions on types with some structure is a valuable insight. However I do not go too much into the “theory” and leave it at <em>a type with some structure which can be mapped over</em> - this generally blows the students mind anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applicatives</strong>. Probably one of the hardest sells, I motivate it basically through <em>currying within a functor</em>. It is there, where students <em>should</em> get a glimpse what effectful programming means and how it can be achieved in a pure functional language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foldable and Monoids</strong>. Getting more abstract, but folds and monoids have entered mainstream OO in functional stream processing, so students understand that it <strong>is</strong> useful. However the reductionist way that Haskell captures these concepts is perfect to explain it from first principles. Also I think every computer science student should know and understand what a <em>Monoid</em> is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monads</strong>. I spend quite a lot of time building up to and motivating Monads as they capture everything learned so far and allow me then to talk about IO, Concurrency, STM and Property-Based Testing all of which build on Monads in some way. I am not using the do-notation straight away but am forcing them down the way along the »= operator to make it <strong>really</strong> explicit. The main point I make and I discuss at length here (and in IO) is <em>side effects</em>. When you come from a mainstream OO language, your idea about side effects is rather implicit and you have probably not thought about it in such an explicit way as you were forced to when dealing with it in Haskell. This is what I subject the students to and I think it is absolutely worth it: being more explicit about side effects in your thinking, reasoning and your code ultimately leads to better developers and better code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IO</strong> (and do-notation). After pestering the students with explicit »= I show them the do-notation and how to do “real-world” stuff with IO. At this point this is a huge relief for them as they have been wondering for some time now where the promised real-world applicability of Haskell is. The more important insight I discuss and students take away from this is that there are “impure uncontrollable” (IO) and “pure, controllable” (previous Monads) side effects - again this will broaden their horizon and allows them to think even more explicitly and detailed about side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concurrency</strong>. Is generally a very poorly treated topic in CS studies. Students learn how easy it is to write concurrent programs in Haskell using <em>IORef</em>, <em>MVar</em> and <em>Async/Wait</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>STM</strong>. To show students a very different approach to concurrency, making another showcase for the amazing type system of Haskell and how it deals with side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property-Based Testing</strong>. To show students that there is more than tedious <em>Unit Tests</em> (they should be already familiar with). Expressing functional specifications directly in code blows their mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dependent Types</strong>. Going beyond Haskell and showing them whats next and what extremely powerful concepts are lurking in Dependent Types (I am using Idris): Types as 1st class Citizen, Totality, Programs as Proofs, Dependent Functions, Dependent Pairs, Equality as Type, Philosophical Foundations. So students have a rough idea what is possible but which will take decades to arrive in mainstream (if at all).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the future of the course?
I can imagine that I am going to try out teaching Erlang in this course instead of Haskell and see how it goes down - or Rust - or Scala - or Clojure. Each of these languages has unique concepts and also allows to cover a few of the concepts I am teaching with Haskell. However, the problem is that to teach a language and its concepts you need to have mastered it both conceptually and in a real-world context, otherwise the teaching experience will be a shallow one. Unfortunately I can only say that about Haskell, Erlang and Java and I would need to fully and deeply learn other languages if I aim on teaching them. Unfortunately I doubt that I will have the time for that undertaking as it is substantial, therefore I will probably continue with Haskell as it is the language I am very familiar with and will stick with for the next years for real-world software engineering research. Still, just to get some fresh air into the course I think at one point I will try to go with Erlang or Elixir, which would also allow me to capture OO concepts from a functional perspective (how we can emulate subtyping with actors for example).</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>The brain is waking and with it the mind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.</p>
<p>Charles S. Sherrington, <em>Man on his Nature</em>, 1940</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Sherrington described the human brain as the <em>enchanted loom</em> in the mid-20th century, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine">Jacquard loom</a> featured in his prose had been one of the most complex mechanical devices ever invented for over a hundred years. It used a system of punched cards that encoded complex patterns to be weaved into textile. The punched cards devised for the Jacquard loom would later find wider use in early computers, also programmed with punchcards. This is where software was born.</p>
<p>Given the place the Jacquard loom held in the history of mechanical craftsmanship, it’s no surprise that Sherrington imagined the human brain, still the most complex system we know of in the universe, as a system of looms weaving ephemeral patterns into memories and cognition.</p>
<p>Decades have passed, and the complexity of microprocessors used in Internet-scale computing systems dwarf the complexity of even the largest Jacquard patterns. Today, we imagine usurping the capabilities of the human brain with software instead of looms.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten closer, but I’m not sure that computers as we know it will get us there yet. Inventing the computer and the deep neural network may still be one of the first few steps in replicating the magic of the <em>enchanted loom</em>, and in this post, I want to explore the future that I imagine in our steps forward.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-kind-of-computer">A new kind of computer</h2>
<p>I firmly believe that deep neural networks represent a fundamentally <em>different kind of tool</em> than computers as we’ve known them since their invention.</p>
<p>Programs that run on conventional computers that aren’t neural nets – a class of programs I’ll call “classical computing” – are all built on the same fundamental conceptual foundation: the ability to emulate Turing machines efficiently.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a> is an abstract model of what it means to “compute” something. The model has a small machine working with a limited set of rules along an infinite tape of “memory” on which it can read and write data, and computer scientists consider the Turing machine the de-facto model for the <em>capability</em> that a computer has. This means that any classical program we can write for a computer can be re-written as a program fed into a Turing machine. All modern computers, from your smartphone and laptop to servers in Google’s datacenters to the microcontroller in your thermostat, are built on this foundational capability of <em>emulating a Turing machine</em>, and thus being able to solve the same problems a Turing machine can theoretically solve.</p>
<p>This is the reason that a program written for one computer can be safely re-written for another computer, and an algorithm designed for one programming language can be re-written in another language. All of these tools and computers encode the same powerful problem-solving power, which is the computational capability that a Turing machine represents. This capability includes things like efficient arithmetic, simulation, and working with strings of data, and these capabilities of the Turing machine turn out to unlock a whole world of power for users of computers – the power we enjoy today on our personal devices.</p>
<p>The Turing machine encodes a particular <em>class of problems</em> that classical computers can solve. But there are problems that are intractable for even the fastest, most efficient Turing machines, problems like factoring large prime numbers, infinite-precision decimal arithmetic, and the traveling-salesman problem. We depend on the intractability of some of these problems for the security of modern cryptography.</p>
<p>But just because these problems are impenetrable to computers based on Turing machines, doesn’t mean the are impossible problems. For example, a classical computer can’t work with infinite-precision decimal numbers, because they have finite memory. But we humans can trivially work with infinite-precision quantities, by using geometry. If you wanted me to tell you the exact value of the golden ratio, an irrational number, I could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle#Construction">construct a geometric representation</a> for you with a pencil, a ruler, and a compass, and you could measure it to any desired level of precision. Turing machine-based computers are powerful, but their power has limits.</p>
<p>Classical computers, like the one you have in your pocket or the one on which you’re reading this post, give us the <em>computational capability</em> to solve a specific class of problems. There are other <em>kinds of computers</em> that unlock the ability to solve other kinds of problems that are intractable for the computers we’re used to.</p>
<p>Astute readers will already know one such example of a new kind of computer: the quantum computer. Quantum computers don’t operate on the Turing machine model. Instead, the equivalent concept – the “quantum Turing machine” – encodes the total computational power of quantum computers in a mathematical model. Quantum computers give us a new kind of <em>computational capability</em>, namely the ability to run algorithms over a whole range of possible values, rather than a single value as in a classical computer. Using this new capability, we can attack new kinds of problems previously intractable for a Turing machine-based computer, like factoring large prime numbers, which is possible on a quantum computer using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, there exist <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/computing/">different computational capabilities</a>, defined by the kinds of problems we can solve with each particular model of computing. Two examples are classical computers, emulating a Turing machine, and quantum computers, operating on a state space of values rather than single pieces of data.</p>
<p>Deep neural nets, I think, represent a third kind of computational capability.</p>
<h2 id="the-turing-machine-for-cognition">The Turing machine for cognition</h2>
<p>Training and making predictions with a deep neural net <em>can</em> run on a classical computer (as they almost always do today), but the operations that comprise computation with a neural net aren’t the atoms of Turing machines, but something different. They’re large, massively multi-dimensional matrix multiplications calculating weights and differentials across huge numbers of values at once in uniform ways. This fundamentally different computation model is what makes DNNs so well-suited to run on parallel processors like GPUs. But beyond that simple acceleration, we’ve been inventing new computing hardware for deep neural nets for a while now, better suited to the kinds of computational work required for a neural net. We’ve invented new kinds of processors (tensor processors), new kinds of data representations (bfloat16, reduced-precision floats), and alternative ways of writing programs (dataflow graphs) that are better suited to this new kind of computational power.</p>
<p>I think this suggests that <strong>deep neural nets represent a fundamentally new computational capability</strong>, different from classical computing that run sequentially on CPUs and efficiently emulate Turing machines. I’ll call this new capability <strong>cognitive computing</strong> to contrast with classical computing and quantum computing. Deep neural network-based software systems aren’t about emulating Turing machines or running algorithms designed for classical computers. Instead, they give computers the ability to solve new kinds of problems that resemble cognition.</p>
<p>Like quantum computers, DNNs open up a new, previously intractable class of problems for computers. These problems generally look like <em>cognitive or perceptive tasks</em>, things like learning the rules of an unknown system, recognizing patterns in data, breaking down images and text into sensible parts, and making inferences based on past patterns.</p>
<p>“But Linus,” you might object to this idea, “if deep neural nets really represent a new kind of computational capability, how can we run them on classical computers?”</p>
<p>Excellent question.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-vacuum-tubes">Beyond vacuum tubes</h2>
<p>Even though cognitive and quantum computing represent different kinds of computational power, they aren’t completely inaccessible to each other. For example, it’s possible for fast classical computers, like the CPU in your laptop, to simulate a small quantum computer, albeit very slowly and inefficiently. But because a classical computer simulating a quantum computer has to keep track of exponentially more data, large quantum problems for which quantum computers are useful are impractical to simulate on a classical computer. (And by “impractical” I mean that constructing a computer capable of it would require more atoms that exist in the universe.)</p>
<p>When we run cognitive algorithms on deep neural nets on GPUs and tensor processors today inside our classical computers, we’re doing something akin to simulating quantum computers inside classical ones. We’re taking a massive hit in efficiency, for the benefit that we already know how to work with classical computers! But to really take advantage of the best that DNNs can offer humanity, we’ll need more efficient and DNN-friendly <em>computational substrates</em>.</p>
<h3 id="computing-capabilities-computing-substrates">Computing capabilities, computing substrates</h3>
<p>In the possibility space of computers, there are two axes: capabilities and substrates. A computational <em>capability</em> describes the kinds of problems that a computer can solve: quantum algorithms, deep learning algorithms, basic arithmetic, and so on. A computational <em>substrate</em> is the physical material on which the algorithm runs: paper-and-pen, vacuum tubes, microprocessors, ion atoms, GPUs, and so on.</p>
<p>For each computational capability, there are many, many substrates on which we can execute the same algorithms. The first computers that ran on vacuum tubes can theoretically run the same programs that my iPhone 12 runs today, even though they use different substrates under the hood, because they implement the same computational …</p></article></div>

</p>
<p>
I find these descriptions uninspiring and <strong>wouldn't be so excited</strong> about Guix if that's really all it was. So what is Guix really, how does it relate to these descriptions, and what makes it so compelling and different?
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="headline-1">
Guix is a Universal Software Deployment System
</h3>
<p>
Guix puts software and data onto computers, following your plan. In that sense, its closest competitors might be Ansible, Chef, or Docker. But it's a more useful and capable technology than any of those because its underlying model is so expressive. It provides a collection of composable building blocks to create and organize systems of any complexity and deploy them to any computer, all using declarative code.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-2">
Uniform
</h4>
<p>
When you run software with Guix you take total control over the <em>how</em> and <em>where</em>, without having to use different tools and processes depending on your choice. You can run software normally on your machine, or in a container, in a virtual machine, on some other machine, or across a cluster of remote machines, by providing different configurations. And when you change your mind as the situation evolves, the tool follows.
</p>
<p>
Containers &amp; VMs are truly optional in Guix. The reproducibility of your deployments does not rely on containerizing or virtualizing every application, so the decision of whether to run uncontained on bare metal, in a container, or virtualized, is up to your choice rather than being imposed upon you by the platform.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-3">
Scalable
</h4>
<p>
Guix is comfortable at any scale. While it can deploy systems across a whole cluster, it's just as easy on a single-user machine. This doesn't require simulating a cluster or installing a stripped-down mini version of the software, because Guix only loads the building blocks you need to operate at the scale you ask for.
</p>
<p>
You can use Guix to deploy your developer tools like <code>vim</code> and <code>git</code> onto your own machine. That's where the comparisons of Guix to a "package manager" come from: installing software on your own machine is just as easy as with <code>apt</code> or <code>brew</code>, just <code>guix install vim</code> and you're set. But with a little more configuration, it can also deploy a complex service, eg. Ruby + Rails + Postgres + nginx. Or it can deploy an entire operating system on a single computer or on a whole clusters of machines. You scale-up by providing a configuration that invokes more components of Guix, activating them to orchestrate deployment on whatever scale you care about in the scenario.
</p>
<p>
Guix views an operating system as just a big collection of software and data, organized into services. Just as you can deploy a single service on your computer, you can scale that up and deploy the whole set of them that comprises an operating system. The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/System-Installation.html#System-Installation">Guix System</a> is a full ready-to-use operating system defined entirely using Guix in terms of software packages and services, and you can use it as a template to deploy any kind of operating system you can imagine. This is where the descriptions of Guix as a "distribution" come from: because Guix is so powerful and general, you can use it in place of a traditional operating system distro.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-4">
Reproducible
</h4>
<p>
Using Guix to deploy your software helps make it resistant to bitrot, configuration drift, and all the forces of entropy. That's because every build, deploy, and configuration using Guix is designed to be byte-for-byte reproducible, and it automates the creation of detailed provenance files describing the names, versions, and configurations of every single piece of software that's part of the deployed system.
</p>
<p>
Once you get software working on your own machine, you want to ship it to other machines and be able to trust it'll work there too. Guix makes that realistic. It isolates packages and builds from the host system and from one another so they don't interact in any ways you don't define explicitly. It can also create pure isolated execution environments for development and testing to help you ensure that your software will work the same wherever it's deployed.
</p>
<p>
Many language ecosystems also to go great lengths to deliver this same sort of experience. But Guix does it in a way that is independent of languages or build tool and spans the full stack. Often the odd dependencies become the trickiest part of installation and deployment, but because Guix is universal it tackles the whole problem with one tool set.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-5">
Extensible
</h4>
<p>
These capabilities arise from a design which uses a collection of composable building blocks to create systems of any desired scale and complexity. You can reuse them as a library and extend them with your own blocks to create new ways of describing and deploying systems. For example, the <a href="https://www.guixwl.org/">Guix Workflow Language</a> extends Guix with tools for managing scientific data workflows.
</p>
<p>
Guix is totally programmable and fully compatible with infrastructure-as-code. The definition for every object in Guix, from an <code>origin</code> (describing the location and metadata of some source code) to a <code>package</code>, <code>service</code>, or <code>operating-system</code>, is all just code. We provide a rich set of domain-specific languages for writing declarative descriptions, which you can extend with your own logic.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-6">
Guix Makes Many Software Problems Optional
</h3>
<p>
The uniformity and expressiveness of Guix allow you to avoid entire classes of problems with software deployment that we typically use a collection of tools to handle.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-7">
Fetch and manage versions of your runtimes and dependencies
</h4>
<p>
If you use Ruby you might be familiar with <code>rvm</code>, <code>gem</code>, and <code>bundler</code>, the tools for managing installed versions of Ruby, fetching Ruby libraries, and collecting sets of Ruby libraries that comprise the dependencies for a service, respectively. If you also use Python you might be familiar with <code>pyenv</code>, <code>pip</code>, and <code>pipenv</code>, which perform the same functions for Python. In general, we might say that if you use <code>N</code> languages, you likely use some multiple of <code>N</code>, <code>N×C</code>, language-specific tools to manage the tools and libraries you use.
</p>
<p>
Guix replaces all these tools. It can fetch the version of the compilers and language runtime you want and all your dependencies, and it can provide a file describing the complete provenance of that software, comparable to a lockfile. And even better, you're free to use a single manifest and lockfile to describe all the runtimes, dev tools, and dependencies for your project, no matter how many language ecosystems they span.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-8">
Avoid version conflicts
</h4>
<p>
If you run many versions of a service on your local machine, you may be familiar with tools like <code>bundler</code>, <code>virtualenv</code>, and <code>docker</code> which allow you to create separate, disjoint environments for each version of the service to avoid conflicting versions of dependencies. Dependency conflicts happen when many different pieces of code want to have the same name on your system. These listed tools avoid conflicts by creating many copies of your dependencies in different folders for each project.
</p>
<p>
Guix sidesteps this problem entirely by addressing every package and every file using unique hashes instead of potentially-conflicting global names. It doesn't need to make a copy for every project, because each version you want has a globally unique name you can depend upon directly. You won't need to type those hashes or hard-code them into your scripts or other build tools, because Guix provides hooks to set environment variables similar to how the above version management tools work.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-9">
Treat deployment problems as optional
</h4>
<p>
Guix doesn't try to forbid you from using these tools you might be familiar with. It'll happily install them for you. But wouldn't it be nice to treat these tools as viable solutions to an optional problem, a software deployment wrinkle that you can opt-out of if it becomes too complex? Using Guix gives you the freedom to make the best technical decisions about how to manage your dependencies without feeling forced to use all these language-specific tools out of necessity.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-10">
Guix is Radically Free
</h3>
<p>
Every part of Guix is free software according to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en">Free Software Definition</a>, and the Guix project as a whole meets the much higher standards of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Free System Distribution Guidelines</a>. Beyond that, the design of Guix is carefully thought-out to help you make practical use of your freedom.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-11">
Take control of your upgrade cycle
</h4>
<p>
Guix never requires you to upgrade the version of a package system-wide just to deploy some other package. You can choose to keep some packages extremely stable and update them on a slow regular cadence, while deploying bleeding edge versions of others, and it won't cause you any hassle.
</p>
<p>
You aren't restricted to the versions of packages provided by the Guix upstream project. When deploying software you can always specify a specific version, tag, branch, commit hash, or even provide your own patches.
</p>
<p>
Guix puts you totally in control of what you deploy, so you don't need to upgrade when a distro maintainer says it's time or wait for them to provide a new version you want to use.
</p>
<h4 id="headline-12">
Bring your own libraries, tools, and other software
</h4>
<p>
You can add definitions for your own internal packages, services, and operating systems to Guix. These do not have second-class status: they get all the same powers, bells and whistles as what you get from Guix upstream. You can add one or more internal <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html">channels</a> to your Guix configuration to extend it in any way you like. You can also <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Creating-a-Channel.html">publish a channel</a> to your organization or to the world.
</p>
<p>
The Guix project does not maintain any kind of gatekeeper role. While Guix itself is radically free, we pass that freedom on to you in its entirety to be a full member of our ecosystem and publish any software using any business model, licenses and terms you deem appropriate.
</p>
<h3 id="headline-13">
So That's What Guix Is!
</h3>
<p>
The Guix project is backed by a non-profit foundation and maintained entirely by volunteers. It has no backing …</p></div></div>

<p><em>If you’d like to get an Amiga Parceiro for yourself, I explain how you can pre-order one at a heavily discounted rate at the end of the video and this article.</em></p><p>


A couple of years ago I made some videos where I showed my favorite Amiga 1000 setup at that time. It had two main hardware super powers that made it my daily driver. </p><p>

First, a fly-by of a glorious <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmW6LEwgruE">Rejuvenator board</a>, designed by the late Greg Tibbs out of Ohio (RIP Greg). A local good friend of mine here in Seattle named Christian Stich helped me upgrade that board to utilize a rare A3000 Agnus I found that can use 2MB of Chip RAM, which he custom built adapters for it to use. It also has a Kickstart 1.3 ROM chip to accelerate the boot up process and lose the typical Kickstart floppy. </p><div>

<p><em>Christian here is removing the old DRAMs, which were eight 256Kx4 in DIP format. He then installed four custom 1Mx4 in SOJ format  DRAMs with an adapter board that converts them to DIP format.</em></p><p>


The second thing was a hardware combo where I used a Microbotics Starboard expansion made back in 1987 that provided both extra fast RAM (in this case 1Mb), a real-time clock, and a SCSI module called the <a href="https://youtu.be/6BLXxY7FG5M">StarDrive which allowed me to use an Iomega SCSI Zip</a> as an external 100 MB hard drive. It used a custom Workbench boot disk that would pass control from the floppy over to the Zip drive and essentially turn the Zip into a semi-autobooting hard drive, which was a total game changer for that system. For all intents and purposes, that Amiga 1000 became one of my favorite, most treasured systems in my entire Amiga collection. </p><p>

<strong>A1000 equipped Starboard with SCSI Zip 100 as a hard drive </strong></p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BLXxY7FG5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>
Fast-forward to today, as I made the difficult decision to <em>remove</em> the Starboard and Zip drive and replace it with a brand new device called the <strong>Amiga Parceiro</strong>. (Parceiro in Portuguese means “partner”.) So it’s the Friend Partner. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"></p><p>

The Amiga Parceiro was invented over the course of the past year by an Amiga hobbyist named David Dunklee who resides in a small town outside of Colorado Springs, CO. </p><p>

As Dunklee puts it:</p><div>

<p>
Fun Trivia: Mr Dunklee, now retired, was the CIO of the <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/">United States Space Force</a>, as well as an Air Force base commander. You heard that right, Number One. </p><p>


So let’s take a look at Mr. Dunklee’s new device for the Amiga 1000 and see what it can do. </p><p>

At a high level, the Parceiro can do everything my Starboard &amp; Zip combo could do except in a very tidy, modern package. And it can do it all faster and better. </p><div>

<p>
The Parceiro (sounds like par-say-ro) attaches to the side expansion port of the Amiga and is about the size of a harmonica that’s been run over by a steam roller as it’s only about 1/3 of an inch thick.</p><p>

It provides the following features: </p><ol><li> 8MB of Autoconfig Fast RAM. It is a single 8MB of SRAM versus DRAM, so it really and truly is indeed fast with zero wait states.</li> 
<li> Coin-cell battery backed Real Time Clock (RTC), which comes with its own clock software that gets put into your startup sequence.</li>
<li> SD Card Reader with 2GB MicroSD. It comes pre-formatted with the FAT32  file system and is readable on any PC as a result. This way you can quickly set up your new SD-based hard drive.</li></ol> <p>

It’s worth mentioning that this is running on period correct Amiga OS 1.3, too. </p><div>

Possibly the best unseen feature is the silkscreen prints Dunklee put around the various chips and resistors on the board. It’s a complete sci-fi treasure trove of labelling, from Back to the Future to Battlestar Galactica. </p><div>

For his fantastic creativity on the silkscreen, I half-jokingly suggested to Mr. Dunklee a future 3D printed case in clear acrylic so I could totally nerd out with his hilarious labels. And I think he might actually take me up on that idea some day! </p><div>

The Parceiro comes with instructions for creating your own KickWork disk to quickly boot up your machine and install all of the necessary software to run the device. This includes the necessary updates to your Mountlist, Startup-Sequence, adding fat95 drivers as well as the sd.device drivers. </p><p>

The <a href="https://amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=312">KickWork disk idea</a> is based off a product developed in 1988 by Mr. Rudolph Loew (RIP). This is where a Kickstart disk is combined with a stripped down Workbench disk for faster machine boot ups off a single floppy rather than 2. </p><p>

With the Parceiro, Dunklee provides six pages of detailed instructions for getting you up and running in no time. The idea here is the modified KickWork (or Workbench) disk will begin the machine’s boot up process like normal then hand over total control to the SD card like a full-fledged autobooting hard drive. It’s not 100% autobooting, but it’s pretty danged close. And once the machine fully boots you just pop out the boot floppy disk and set it to the side. Mr Dunklee confided with me that in a distant hardware update he might take the next logical step and integrate an FPGA for a true autobooting experience. </p><p>

Since my machine is equipped with a Rejuvenator board, I didn’t need a KickWork disk. So I made a customized Workbench boot disk making the necessary adjustments following Mr Dunklee’s instructions for the RTC software, the SD card device driver and adding the FAT file system library. </p><p>

In the Amiga world, this is about as close to plug-and-play for a device with this many features that I’ve ever come across that doesn’t completely take over your machine and its identity like a Vampire, or some might argue even the ACA500+ (which basically uses the A1000's power to mostly take over). The Parceiro installation was absolutely seamless and I got it up and running without a hitch. </p><p>

Now some of you might be wondering how long it takes to boot this 2GB equipped Amiga. For example, on my Amiga 2000 I have a 40 MB mechanical boot drive, but I also have a SCSI2SD card with 2GB MicroSD for all of my software and data storage. When that machine boots it can sit on a gray screen for about 20 -25 seconds while the large drive is being validated. Once that process is done the A2K snaps to life and I’m on my way. </p><p>

With the Parceiro it’s a very different - and better - experience than I’m used to. The Parceiro still needs to validate the empty space on the drive, but instead it does it in the background. So the Amiga 1000 boots up without that normal long pause. While the background validation is going on, the volume is set to READ ONLY. I can still run programs but I simply can’t write to the drive while the validation is going on. To be honest I wouldn’t even know about this had it not been noted in the instructions, as I’m virtually never writing to the drive the moment I boot it up. And within a few seconds the little Cylon red LED light stops flickering and I know then it’s job is complete (which didn’t directly affect me anyway). </p><p>

Very, very cool! </p><p>

Now, this device is currently in extremely short supply. In fact, I happened to get S/N #1 and I know S/N #2 was sold a few hours after I got mine. At that stage the inventory was sold out. But several more will eventually get made over time so if you’re an Amiga 1000 fan that means you're patient by default. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"> I’d highly recommend you keep this on your radar and try to snag one of them for yourself. It’s simply bad ass and it didn’t require me to upgrade my OS beyond adding new drivers - or really change anything - like a lot of modern upgrades often do.  </p><p>

The Parceiro is a fantastic device, made in the USA, and is a very worthy successor to the Microbotics and Supra offerings from BITD. It is one of the few modern devices that is 100% designed for the Amiga 1000 for a change. And how cool and refreshing is that? </p><p>


<strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><p>

If you’d like to pre-order one of these little technological marvels for yourself at a nearly <strong>20% discounted rate at $195</strong>, simply email <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#387955515f591668594a5b5d514a5778574d4c54575753165b5755"><span data-cfemail="c283afaba5a3ec92a3b0a1a7abb0ad82adb7b6aeadada9eca1adaf">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to declare your interest <strong>and mention AmigaLove sent you</strong>. You will still need to cover expenses for shipping, of course, but you’ll get in line for your very own Parceiro. David Dunklee will manage the rest from there!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The underlying infrastructure of modern networked computing—namely Unix and its derivatives—is approaching fifty years of age.  What will come to replace it?  A strong competitor is the clean-slate “operating function” approach of Urbit.  Jocosely branded as “computing for Martians,” Urbit provides a fresh and updated vision of what Internet computing could come to look like in future years.  Featuring end-to-end encryption and true peer-to-peer routing built on a network-first operating system, Urbit fosters decentralized digital societies and stable user identities.</p>

<p>Our primary objectives in this course are for you to be able to explain and navigate the technical layout of Urbit, as well as construct novel applications for Arvo, the Urbit operating function, using the Hoon programming language.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the schematics and technical implementation of the Urbit OS kernel (Arvo and vanes).</li>
  <li>Navigate and utilize the Urbit ID public-key infrastructure (Azimuth).</li>
  <li>Program literately using the Hoon language, including source code conventions and interoperability.</li>
  <li>Construct userspace apps to run on the Urbit OS platform (Gall, Landscape).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>

<p>My target audience for the course consists of graduate students and seniors in computer science and neighboring fields interested in sound computing and functional operating system design (functional-as-in-language).  The course assumes an interest in functional programming but no specific experience<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centzon_T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dchtin">.</a>  <!-- egg --></p>

<p>I wanted to share a story of a segmentation fault I helped track down this weekend. I thought the final root cause of the segfault was interesting because of how unrelated it was to the code I was trying to debug.</p>



<p>I’ve been maintaining a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source" target="_blank">Linux fork</a> of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source">obs-ios-camera-source</a>, which is an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> plugin that allows you to use an iPhone or iPad’s camera and microphone as a video and audio source in OBS. It works in conjunction with the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://obs.camera/" target="_blank">Camera for OBS Studio</a>” app in the App Store. This kind of thing is useful for online streamers who want to use their phone’s camera instead of buying a separate camera. For those of you who don’t know, OBS is short for Open Broadcaster Software. A lot of streamers use it to handle broadcasting their stream. It allows you to capture audio and video, mix it all together, do all kinds of cool things with it, and then record the final result and/or stream it to sites such as YouTube and Twitch.</p>



<p>Getting this plugin working on Linux wasn’t really complicated, because it was already well-written without much platform-specific code. After all, the existing codebase was already operational on both macOS and Windows. It mostly just required tweaking a few compile/link options to make the code run happily on Linux.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’m pretty sure a good number of people have been using my Linux port of this plugin without issues. I know it works fine for me when I test with it in Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04. I’ve helped people on other distros get it working too. I don’t really do any streaming myself — maybe someday though!</p>



<p>On Friday, GitHub user rrondeau <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/issues/4" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/issues/4" target="_blank">reported an issue</a>: after a half a year of the obs-ios-camera-source plugin working without a problem, it suddenly started causing OBS to segfault on his computer (currently running Fedora 33). He provided a stack trace that showed that the segfault was happening because of something initiated by the plugin. Afterward, he used GDB to get a better stack trace that provided more info about the functions being called and the parameters being passed:</p>

<p>The actual segfault was happening inside of a function called “socket_send” in libsamba-sockets-samba4.so, which was being called by a function in libusbmuxd, which is bundled as part of the obs-ios-camera-source plugin source code and is used for communicating with iOS devices over USB. When I first saw this in the stack trace, my mind thought “Huh…that’s weird. Why does libusbmuxd use Samba’s library for its socket code instead of providing its own?” (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.samba.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.samba.org/" target="_blank">Samba</a> is an implementation of the Windows file sharing protocol used by pretty much every Linux distribution)</p>



<p>I tested and couldn’t reproduce the issue in Ubuntu. I know basically nothing about Fedora, but I faked my way through grabbing a Fedora 33 virtual machine, installing OBS, and compiling the plugin. I ran into the exact same issue that he was seeing.</p>



<p>Before I had a chance to look deeper and understand what was going on, rrondeau beat me to the correct conclusion: code in Samba’s library was mistakenly being called. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/blob/8181922136e12ef618c8449f95a52e40d7104ded/deps/libusbmuxd/common/socket.h#L61" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/dougg3/obs-ios-camera-source/blob/8181922136e12ef618c8449f95a52e40d7104ded/deps/libusbmuxd/common/socket.h#L61" target="_blank">libusbmuxd has a function called socket_send</a>, but clearly <a href="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/f52f531771d6a25b2e363384bf94a9fa14334e1b/source4/lib/socket/socket.h#L152" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/f52f531771d6a25b2e363384bf94a9fa14334e1b/source4/lib/socket/socket.h#L152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">libsamba-sockets-samba4’s function that is also named socket_send</a> was accidentally being called instead.</p>



<p>Honestly, that’s all we really needed to know. Renaming libusbmuxd’s socket_send function to something else, and updating all references to it to use the new name, fixed the issue. I still wanted to understand why this suddenly became an issue when it had been working fine prior to that. Why were we calling into Samba libraries? Why does an iOS USB multiplexing library even consider talking to a library associated with Windows file sharing?</p>



<p>Not knowing the answer to that question bothered me. I decided to dig deeper and understand exactly what was going on. I started by using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix)" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ldd_(Unix)" target="_blank">ldd</a>, which lists all dynamic libraries used by a program or library:</p>


<pre title="">[fedora@fedora33 build]$ ldd obs-ios-camera-source.so 
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffa599a000)
	libobs.so.0 =&gt; /lib64/libobs.so.0 (0x00007f0a3f688000)
	libavcodec.so.58 =&gt; /lib64/libavcodec.so.58 (0x00007f0a3e2db000)
	libavutil.so.56 =&gt; /lib64/libavutil.so.56 (0x00007f0a3e036000)
...
	libsamba-sockets-samba4.so =&gt; /usr/lib64/samba/libsamba-sockets-samba4.so (0x00007fd6af4b7000)
...
</pre>


<p>I truncated the output because it spit out a very long list of libraries. As we can see from ldd’s output, obs-ios-camera-source.so depends on libsamba-sockets-samba4.so. ldd lists all recursive dependencies as well, and I couldn’t find any references to “samba” in the plugin source code, so this was likely an indirect dependency instead. I confirmed this by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readelf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readelf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">readelf</a> to show only the direct dependencies:</p>


<pre title="">[fedora@fedora33 build]$ readelf -d obs-ios-camera-source.so | grep NEEDED
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libobs.so.0]

 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
</pre>


<p>At this point I used ldd and readelf to walk through the tree of dependencies and figure out what was actually linking against the Samba libraries. I later learned that I could have installed lddtree (part of the pax-utils package) to do this automatically. Either way, this led me to discover that the Samba libraries were being included through libsmbclient, which was a dependency of libavformat (part of FFmpeg). libavformat is a dependency of libobs.</p>



<p>Repeating this experiment on Ubuntu showed that libavformat on Ubuntu does not depend on libsmbclient. This explains why I couldn’t reproduce the issue on Ubuntu. So why does Fedora’s (well, <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rpmfusion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPM Fusion</a>‘s) version of libavformat depend on libsmbclient?</p>



<p>It turns out that it’s a compile-time option for FFmpeg. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsmbclient.c" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/libsmbclient.c" target="_blank">libavformat contains code for talking with Windows servers using libsmbclient</a>, but it’s an optional thing that you can choose to enable at compile time. Clearly Ubuntu chooses not to enable it, but RPM Fusion does. <a href="https://lists.rpmfusion.org/archives/list/rpmfusion-commits@lists.rpmfusion.org/thread/57UYP4VFY3VCJFU3DGPHLUE3JPYP73HJ/">Actually, I found the exact post on RPM Fusion’s commits mailing list</a> where the patch was added for enabling SMB support in FFmpeg. This patch is what led to the whole issue happening. If Ubuntu’s version of FFmpeg was being built with SMB support, we would have seen this a long time ago. This commit to RPM Fusion was made on December 31, 2020, which explains why rrondeau had only recently begun seeing the problem.</p>



<p>The root cause here is that the obs-ios-camera-source plugin was linking against two libraries that both provided a function named socket_send: libsamba-sockets-samba4 (indirectly through libobs) and libusbmuxd. libusbmuxd was being linked statically, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884945/shared-library-symbol-conflicts-and-static-linking-on-linux" data-type="URL" data-id="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884945/shared-library-symbol-conflicts-and-static-linking-on-linux" target="_blank">that doesn’t prevent functions in it from being resolved through dynamic linking rules anyway</a>. So even though libusbmuxd was a static library with its own internal implementation of socket_send, it was using …</p></div></div>

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Corminaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore. To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue (for example from <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a>) is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. Either way, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and be bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>
      </li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I decided to learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, mainly because I’m very interested in <a href="https://substrate.dev/">Substrate</a> (a Blockchain framework). At first, I thought it would be an easy task, and that it will take just a few days and I should be up and running. Well, that wasn’t the case, I really struggled with this language, it reminded me of my University days, studying C++, I felt like I don’t know what I’m doing, which is probably very true. </p><p>So, I decided to take a step back and have another take on this process, approach it a bit differently and in a more systematic way. On my first try, I simply went to the docs read everything, and tried some code. That didn’t really help much, it only made me more confused and less motivated.</p><p>The second time around, I decided to follow a “consistent motivation” approach - something that I came up with while writing this post. </p><p>Basically, whenever I feel lost and unmotivated, I’ll go watch some YouTube videos that would excite me. </p><p>Here are some of my favorite: </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ZfpU7QX3iSatYB2GDum5Q">rhymu8354</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iD0xppBwwsrM9DegC5cQQ">Jon Gjengset</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmSWx6SK0zCU2NqPJ0VmDQ">David Pedersen</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Read the Rust docs, all of it, without trying any of their coding examples, I just wanted to get a feel of what’s going on in this language - the story behind it. That helped my intuition for whenever I read Rust code. </p></li><li><p>Watched a TON of YouTube videos. I found a bunch of great channels of devs streaming themselves learning and coding Rust. That was inspiring and gave me the desire and motivation to actually try to code things myself.</p></li><li><p>Followed the top Rust accounts on Twitter. The goal was to keep myself up to date with all things Rust. They also share great resources and blog posts.</p></li><li><p>Re-read the Rust docs again, this time I tried all the code they provided, and I spent a lot of time familiarising myself with its syntax.</p></li><li><p>Read as many blog posts as I can find.</p></li><li><p>Read all of Substrate <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate">codebase</a> on Github.</p></li><li><p>Build something with Substrate. </p></li></ul><h2>Lesson Learned</h2><ul><li><p>Don’t give up quickly.</p></li><li><p>Realize that learning takes time.</p></li><li><p>You’re not the only person struggling with learning new things.</p></li><li><p>Read other people’s code (!important).</p></li><li><p>READ THE DOCS.</p></li><li><p>CODE CODE CODE.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Great Udemy Course https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-lang/ </p></li><li><p>Official Rust docs https://doc.rust-lang.org/book</p></li><li><p>Rust by example https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Substrate Crowdcasts https://www.crowdcast.io/e/substrate-seminar</p></li><li><p>Substrates Tutorials, Knowledge base, and Recipes https://substrate.dev/en/</p></li><li><p>Substrate Developer Hub https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub</p></li><li><p>Polkadot docs https://wiki.polkadot.network/en</p></li></ul><p>This is my first blog post ever, I hope it helps someone with their coding journey. Oh, and I’m definitely open to any feedback that could help me improve the quality of what I’m sharing on this blog. </p><p>Cheers! </p></div></div>]]>

January 17, 2021 | https://basishealth.io/blog/real-time-fasting-data-with-basis | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://basishealth.io/blog/real-time-fasting-data-with-basis">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-content-content"><p>Caloric restriction is the practice of taking fewer calories than total daily energy needs. Caloric restriction without malnutrition is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention that enhances longevity and healthspan in numerous species. It has been proven to reduce oxidative stress through various pathways and a growing body of evidence shows that sustained periods of caloric restriction without malnutrition improves risk factors involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders in humans. (Weindruch, 1996)</p><p>But chronic caloric restriction is difficult to sustain and newer dietary strategies such as intermittent fasting and protein restriction have emerged as alternative approaches that still improve markers of aging. The most popular type of caloric restriction applied today is a 16:8 Time-Restricted Feeding schedule i.e. no eating for 16 hours, eat for 8 hours. While difficult for some to get started, Intermittent Fasting is generally easy to adopt and has important short and long-term health benefits such as metabolic, cardiovascular, and digestive health benefits. </p><p>Multi-day fasting is another form of fasting with a higher detoxifying effect that activates important an important cellular restoration process called autophagy. Autophagy is a super useful process that recycles, cleans up, and rids your body of damaged and misfolded proteins. When your cells are constantly fed, they aren't worried about efficiency and restoration - they're thinking that 'times are good, we don't need to work hard anymore.' In a well-fed state, your cells are only concerned with growing. Besides putting all their emphasis on growth, your well-fed cells also turn other genes off such as those related to fat metabolism, stress resistance, and damage repair. </p><p>During fasting (starvation), things are very different. We have a well-preserved starvation “program” that kicks our cell into a completely different state when food, particularly glucose or sugar, isn’t around. Your body reacts to the newfound stress by waking up cell functions to protect you and as a result, starts acting more efficiently and dynamically. This 'reactivation' of the cellular system leads to lowered inflammation, increases your brain's resistance to stress, and many other important long-term health benefits.</p><h2>So, what happens to your body on a fast?</h2><p>At Basis, we wanted to put the science to the test and really see what happens in real-time to your body when you’re following a prolonged fast. So I volunteered to be the guinea pig by spending last week doing a 3-day water fast and tracking my vitals in real-time with Basis to see the impact it has on my body.</p><p><img alt="Fasting data" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/xxkgr6gh5t72/3gyIfqHoGt8Iegl8jOcKxR/2eed6467ced1c30d17ca5fd14d27fbf3/Fasting_real_time_.png"></p><p>The Basis app added an extra layer of health confidence for me because I was getting real-time glucose data from my biosensor and could identify if I was going into a hypoglycemic attack; my wearable was connected to Basis and was giving me real-time heart rate data, and I was tracking my hydration and running a once-a-day urinalysis test in Basis to confirm that I wasn’t dealing with dehydration. In Basis, I was also getting my sleep reports for each night, including a time-specific snapshot of my glucose and heart rate - something of particular interest since more than 40% of hypoglycemic events happen during sleep. </p><p>For data sharing purposes, I also did a pre- and post-fast blood panel. You can see a table with the biomarkers I tested for at the top of this post. I've also provided body composition data because I'm sure most people think of fasting for weight loss purposes. </p><p>Disclaimer: Speak with your doctor before undertaking any type of fasting with or without Basis. Your doctor will advise you if any pre-existing condition or abnormalities in your biomarkers could create complications.</p><p>Without further ado, let’s jump into the Basis real-time data along with an explanation of the cellular process that happens as you hit different intervals in your fast. </p><h3><b>DAY 1</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 75 / High 119 / Average 94 </p><p>Glucose Variability: 10.31</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 49 / High 96 / Average 62</p><br><h4><b>12 hours - Hello ketosis. </b></h4><p>In this state, your body starts to break down and burn fat. This process creates ketones which serve as an alternative energy source when glucose isn’t available. </p><br><h4><b>18 hours - Fat-burning mode.</b> </h4><p>I'm now generating significant ketones and I can now begin to measure blood ketone levels above baseline values. Under normal conditions, the concentration of ketones in your plasma ranges below 20 mg/dL but when you fast this concentration can reach 80+ mg/dL. My ketones measured at 32 mg/dL compared to 80 mg/dL for my glucose. </p><br><h4><b>24 hours - Autophagy</b></h4><p>Autophagy can only happen when your glucose stores are significantly low. In humans, that usually happens after 24 hours of fasting. (Alirezaei et al., Autophagy 2010)</p><h3><b>DAY 2</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 69 / High 107 / Average 85 </p><p>Glucose variability: 9.96</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 45 / High 97 / Average 62 </p><br><h4><b>48 hours - Peak growth hormone</b> </h4><p>Growth hormone helps preserve lean muscle mass and reduces fat tissue accumulation, particularly as we age. It also appears to promote wound healing and cardiovascular health. After two days of fasting, the large number of circulating ketone bodies and the impact of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, promote increased growth hormone secretion (Hartman et al.,1992). </p><p>At this point in the fast, my glucose line is virtually flat, ranging between 75 - 85 mg/dL and I'm preserving my energy for essential activities and work. </p><h3><b>DAY 3</b></h3><p>Loading Chart</p><p>Glucose: Low 69 / High 90 / Average 78 </p><p>Glucose variability: 8.27</p><p>Heart-rate: Low 50 / High 120 / Average 64 </p><br><h4><b>72 hours - Checkpoint. </b></h4><p>At the 3-day mark, I've hit a key milestone in cellular regeneration. My body has broken down old immune cells and generated new ones (Cheng et al., 2014). Getting those Covid defenses up! Interestingly, through this same mechanism, prolonged fasting for at least 72 hours has been shown to also preserve healthy white blood cell or lymphocyte counts in patients undergoing chemotherapy. </p><p>Last ketone measurement before breaking the fast. Approaching the 80 mg/dL along with a 79mg/dL glucose level measurement.  </p><br><h4><b>Bonus stage: Refeeding!</b></h4><p>The fast isn’t done until you get some food back in your body. The most important thing to remember is that you should resist the temptation to chow down on a pizza or a burger because as amazing as that may seem in the moment, and trust me the temptation is always there, after 3 days of just sipping on water, it will feel absolutely terrible afterward. Your stomach has for all-intensive purposes shrunk and hasn’t gone through the process of digesting anything for 3 days. You’ll get bad stomach cramping and spend quite a bit of time in the bathroom if you eat a carb-heavy meal. </p><p>Beyond this practical reason, it’s important to break your fast with a nutritious, balanced meal that will further enhance the all-around cell and tissue health-boosting exercise you just undertook. </p><h3><b>Looking for a clearer view of your health?</b></h3><p><a href="https://basishealth.typeform.com/to/ovy5RnER">Sign up</a> for the Basis Early Access Beta and discover what having real-time access to your health data means. </p></div></div>]]>
